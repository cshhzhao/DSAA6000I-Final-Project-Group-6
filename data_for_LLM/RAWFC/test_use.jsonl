        "evidence": "On Sept. 18, 2020, a video clip started to circulate on social media that supposedly showed Fox News’ host Tucker Carlson saying that he was “basically on board” with democratic socialism after his guest, political activist Cornel West, described the ideology as providing ordinary people the opportunity to “live lives of decency.” One version of the video racked up close to 4 million views within a day of its initial posting:\nTucker Carlson finally met Jesus, turns out it was Cornel West the entire time. pic.twitter.com/grNTEKr8os\n— New York Socialist (@berniebromanny) September 18, 2020\n\nThis is a genuine clip of West and Carlson on the Fox News show Tucker Carlson Tonight. However, this clip did not air in 2020 (it’s actually from 2018) and it doesn’t capture Carlson’s full comments about democratic socialism. \nThe clip comes from a July 2018 episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight. While the above-displayed clip is genuine, the footage is cut off right before the “but” Carlson was building to in his remarks and it doesn’t fully encapsulate the Fox News host’s position on democratic socialism. In the full clip, which can be viewed below, Carlson adds: “But the details matter […] Has it struck you as interesting that it’s never actually worked anywhere?”\nHere’s the full clip from Fox News. Carlson introduces West around the 2:20 mark:\nA transcript of the relevant portions of this broadcast appears below. The first block quote shows the portion of this conversation that was included in the viral video. The first few lines (italicized) come just before the start of the viral video:\nCARLSON: So, give us some sense of what democratic socialism is. Can you point to an example, and extant example of it, that works? Venezuela seems like an example of democratic socialism? Would you say that it is? And if so, does it work?\nWEST: No, I don’t think that democratic socialism as an ideal has been able to be embodied in a larger social context.\nThere’s different forms of it. Some are bad, some are medium, some are better. But the fundamental commitment is to the dignity of ordinary people and to make sure they can live lives of decency.\nSo, it’s not an -ism, no, brother. It’s about decency. It’s about fairness. It’s about the accountability of the powerful vis-a-vis those who have less power — at the workplace, women dealing with a household, gays, lesbians, trans, black people, indigenous peoples, immigrants.\nHow do we ensure that they are treated decently and that the powerful don’t in any way manipulate, subjugate and exploit them.\nCARLSON: I mean, if that’s democratic socialism is, then I’m basically on board. I do think that ordinary people, middle-class people ought to have dignity.\nWEST: Absolutely.\nCARLSON: And I think that our current systems make it hard for them to have dignity. So, I agree with all of that.\nThe following transcript shows the conversation that was left out of the viral video:\nCARLSON: But the details matter.\nWEST: That’s precisely why – that’s why Albert Einstein, Helen Keller, Norman Thomas, Eugene Debs, Martin Luther King Jr., Ella Baker, we can go on and on, they’re all democratic socialists. Michael Harrington, one of the great founders of Democratic Socialism of America —\nCARLSON: I understand. But has it struck you as interesting that it’s never actually worked anywhere. So, the question is not what are our goals. Our goals are the same. How do we get there is the question.\nSo, what happened in Venezuela? They called that democratic socialism, but they don’t have toilet paper, and it’s less equal than ever.\nIn short, Carlson told West that he was “on board” with the general goals of democratic socialism, which were defined by West in their exchange as making sure that ordinary people can live lives of decency. Carlson disagreed, however, that democratic socialism was the political ideology that could achieve that goal. ",

        "evidence": "On June 5, 2020, the Barstool Sports Twitter account shared an image of a map that supposedly showed America’s favorite fast food restaurants by state:\n\nThe map went viral, and soon, restaurant chains such as Long John Silvers, Rainforest Cafe, and Sbarro were trending on Twitter as social media users expressed confusion over how these chains were named the favorites in their states. \nThis map, however, is not based on data from an authoritative source. This map is a prank created by Barstool Sports. \nThe first hint is that this data was supposedly compiled by an organization called the Public Information and Statistics Society. Not only could we not find an official organization by this name, the acronym for this group is PISS, which, to say the least, is a bit suspicious. \nBarstool Sports’ punny follow-up tweet also points to the humorous intentions of this map:\n\nThis map of favorite restaurants also doesn’t add up, geographically speaking. For instance, the map claims that The Rainforest Cafe is Colorado’s favorite restaurant chain, despite the fact that there are no Rainforest Cafe locations in the state.\nIn short, this viral map supposedly showing the most popular restaurant chains by state isn’t real and was a joke shared by Barstool Sports that isn’t based on any data from a reputable source. In other words, the Barstool Sports and the Public Information for Statistics Society are just “taking the piss.” ",

        "evidence": "On Nov. 8, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump traveled to the Georgia World Congress Center in downtown Atlanta to take part in a “Black Voices for Trump” rally, at which the president launched an outreach initiative dedicated to “recruiting and activating Black Americans in support of President Trump,” as reported by (among others) CBS News:\nPresident Trump launched his campaign initiative Black Voices for Trump in Georgia, as he tries to make the case that his support among African-Americans is strong, despite low approval ratings.\nIn his address, the president claimed African-Americans are coming back to the Republican Party in “record numbers,” although the president gave no basis for that claim. Only 8% of black voters picked Mr. Trump in 2016, and his support among black voters was just 10% in a recent Quinnipiac poll.\nMr. Trump made the case that Democrats are only interested in African-Americans for their votes every four years, saying they “don’t fight” for the African-American community. Mr. Trump insisted he won’t take those votes for granted.\n“They don’t care. But we do,” the president said.\n\nSome photographs purportedly captured at that event that showed both blacks and non-blacks wearing shirts bearing the identifier “Blacks for Trump” prompted readers to query us about the authenticity of those pictures, particularly one photograph featuring an older white couple:\n“Blacks for Trump” T-shirt wearers are filling up the GWCC ahead of @realDonaldTrump Blacks Voices for Trump initiative. @FOX5Atlanta pic.twitter.com/HP1vR7bXWf\n— Aungelique Proctor (@aungeliquefox5) November 8, 2019\n\n\n\nThe latter photograph, and others like it, were indeed authentic, as described in a New Yorker article about the event (which included a different picture of the same couple):\nBefore noon on Friday, as he was leaving the Atlanta Regional Commission’s “State of the Region” breakfast at the Georgia World Congress Center, in downtown Atlanta, Bem Joiner, a local entrepreneur, saw an elderly white couple “walking so jovial towards us,” as he later put it to me, in a direct message. The grinning couple wore matching white T-shirts with black lettering that read “blacks for trump.” Joiner, who is black, said, “my homegirl took the pic” of the couple, which Joiner later posted on Instagram, “cause I was too in awe of the situation.” In the caption, Joiner referred to the scene as being something out of “The Twilight Zone.”\nIn fact, the couple was in the building for the inaugural Black Voices for Trump rally, which was going to begin a few hours later, in a nearby room.\nSome viewers apparently found such pictures somewhat incongruous, but in general we readily accept that people often support causes that don’t directly affect them: men take part in League of Women Voters functions; healthy people participate in campaigns to raise awareness of breast cancer; citizens hold rallies in support of immigrants, etc. In that same vein, non-blacks might well demonstrate support for a political party or candidate who they felt would undertake greater efforts to assist black citizens.",

        "evidence": "Amid intensifying debate around the prospect of U.S. President Donald Trump’s impeachment after it was revealed he had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated rumors about former Vice President Joe Biden’s dealings with that country, Republicans and Trump supporters hit back by attempting to tie several high-profile Democrats and their families to Ukraine.\nRight-leaning websites scrutinized the purported business activities of Paul Pelosi Jr., son of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and attempted to draw a meaningful connection between Ukraine and the Clintons.\nOn Oct. 6, the Twitter account @RealJack posted a widely-shared tweet which claimed that the sons of Biden and Pelosi, as well as those of former Secretary of State John Kerry and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), had worked for “energy companies doing business in Ukraine”:\nBiden’s son\nPelosi’s son\nRomney’s son\nKerry’s son\nAll are on the board of directors for energy companies doing business in Ukraine…\nCoincidence?\nNo.\n— Jack Murphy (@RealJack) October 6, 2019\n@RealJack’s claims were further promulgated when multiple Facebook accounts re-posted the wording of his tweet, including the group “Texas for Donald Trump 2020”:\nOn Oct. 8, the right-leaning, Trump-supporting Twitter account @Education4Libs attempted to draw all these strands together with a widely-shared, innuendo-laden tweet claiming that an unspecified conspiracy connected donations to the Clinton Foundation with the alleged business activities of the sons of prominent Democrats: “From 1999-2014, Ukraine donated more money to the Clinton Foundation than any other foreign country. Biden, Pelosi, Kerry, & Romney all have children working for Ukrainian gas companies. And all of the people I mentioned want Trump impeached. Are you connecting the dots yet?”\nFrom 1999-2014, Ukraine donated more money to the Clinton Foundation than any other foreign country.\nBiden, Pelosi, Kerry, & Romney all have children working for Ukrainian gas companies.\nAnd all of the people I mentioned want Trump impeached. Are you connecting the dots yet? 🤔\n— Educating Liberals (@Education4Libs) October 8, 2019\nThese tweets constituted a mixture of some accurate statements with mostly false claims, as well as unsubstantiated suggestions of unspecified wrongdoing or corruption on the part of those involved.\nClinton Foundation donations\nIn 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that between 1999 and 2014, Ukrainians had donated more than individuals of any other nationality to the Clinton Foundation, a non-profit humanitarian organization founded by former President Bill Clinton. So @Education4Libs’ claim that Ukraine as a country — rather than individual Ukrainian nationals — had topped the list of donations was not backed up by the Journal’s research.\nHillary Clinton stepped away from her seat on the board of directors of the Clinton Foundation when she became Secretary of State in 2009. According to the foundation’s website, neither she nor Bill nor Chelsea Clinton has ever derived any personal income from their involvement in the charity.\nThe Bidens\nHunter Biden, the former vice president’s 49-year-old son, served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a major Ukrainian natural gas producer, from 2014 until April 2019, according to multiple reports. His decision to join the company’s payroll caused some political discomfort at the time, since Burisma’s owner had recently been embroiled in a money-laundering scandal and Biden’s father, the vice president, was heading the Obama administration’s efforts to discourage and crack down on corruption in Ukraine.\nHowever, no evidence has yet emerged suggesting that either Biden engaged in any wrongdoing with regard to Burisma or Ukraine, despite President Trump’s efforts to have both men investigated. It is accurate to say that Hunter Biden worked for and was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, but no evidence indicates any link between his work there and Ukrainian donations to the Clinton Foundation.\nFurthermore, @Education4Libs claimed in October that Biden is “working for” a Ukrainian gas company, but that’s not correct since he stepped down from his place on the board in April 2019.\nThe Pelosis\nPaul Pelosi Jr., son of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was at one time on the board of a California-based oil-processing company called Viscoil, according to the account he gave in a video recorded in 2010. The link between Viscoil and Ukraine is either tenuous or non-existent and does not appear to involve Pelosi at all.\nViscoil was linked to a somewhat shadowy figure going by the name “Ana Shell,” who claims to be an investor and environmental entrepreneur, and claims to have provided funding to both Viscoil and another entity called NRG Lab. The purported Ukraine connection arose from a YouTube video posted by “NRG Lab Research Council” in 2013, whose caption stated “Mika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine.”\nThat single line from the caption of an NRG Lab promotional video was cited by Patrick Howley, who writes for The Epoch Times, a website known for promulgating pro-Trump misinformation, in advancing a link between Pelosi and an energy company that “did business in Ukraine.” However, the claim that Newton, a Ukrainian singer born Oksana Stefanivna Hrytsay, had any connection to NRG Lab or Viscoil, appears to be false.\nWe found a Facebook page labelled “Mika_Newton.official” which appears distinctly unofficial, has very little content apart from “Ana Shell” promotional imagery, and includes the following description: “Hi, my name’s Mika Newton. This is my official page to support projects that NRGLab Singapore makes”:\n\nNeither Newton’s actual official Facebook page nor her Instagram account (where she engages in prolific product promotion) contain any mention of NRG Lab, Viscoil, or “Ana Shell.” The link between NRG Lab, Newton, and production rights in Ukraine appears to be bogus.\nIn any event, Pelosi appears to have ended his involvement with Viscoil before the bogus Mika Newton connection was ever made. A spokesperson for Speaker Pelosi told PolitiFact that: “The company [Viscoil] was based in Southern California and focused solely on U.S. business. The company later reorganized under a different name [NRG Lab], but Paul Pelosi Jr. played no role in the new entity.”\nPelosi Jr. did travel to Ukraine in 2017, but that trip related to his work for the Corporate Governance Initiative and had no discernible link to Viscoil, NRG Lab, or “Ana Shell.”\nJohn Kerry\nThis claim is riddled with errors. First off, former Secretary of State and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry doesn’t have a biological son. The man in question is his stepson, Chris Heinz, who was born to Kerry’s wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, and her first husband, John Heinz.\nHeinz appears to have been added to the list because of his former business partnership with Hunter Biden and their friend Devon Archer. The three men formed an investment firm called Rosemont Seneca, and both Archer and Biden later joined the board of Burisma. However, Heinz did not.\nIn fact, according to reports by The Washington Post and the Washington Examiner, Heinz expressed his own reservations about Archer and Biden’s decision at the time, which underlines just how inaccurate and wrongheaded the meme’s inclusion of Heinz was.\nA spokesperson confirmed to Snopes that Heinz had never been involved in Burisma in any way, nor had he ever worked for or sat on the board of directors of any energy company, or even traveled to Ukraine.\nMitt Romney\nMitt and Ann Romney have five sons, and we found no evidence that any of them have ever had any involvement with either a “Ukrainian gas company” or an “energy company doing business in Ukraine.”\nThe couple’s oldest son Tagg (49) has worked as a vice president at Reebok, chief marketing officer for the Los Angeles Dodgers, founded the investment firm Solamere Capital, and worked as an advisor and surrogate during his father’s 2002 Massachussetts gubernatorial campaign as well as his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.\nMatt Romney was previously marketing director for the software company LavaStorm, worked as a real estate developer in California, and as a vice president for the real estate investment firm Excel Trust (which was acquired by the private equity firm Blackstone in 2015).\nJosh Romney is president of the Romney Group, a Utah-based real estate and property investment firm, and chairman and owner of Intercap Lending, a mortgage lender. He previously worked as a real estate developer in Salt Lake City.\nBen Romney is a radiologist in Utah and Idaho, and Craig Romney, the youngest son, has worked in music production for the advertising firm McGarry Bowen and later for the real estate investment firm Sundance Bay.\nContrary to @Education4Libs’ claim, Romney had not called for President Trump’s impeachment as of Oct. 8, undermining the putative basis for the Romney family’s inclusion in the nonexistent conspiracy of wrongdoing to which the meme alluded.",

        "evidence": "A Virginia-based LGBTQ advocacy group drew widespread media attention towards a middle school after posting their account of school official’s failing to ensure a transgender student’s safety during a shooting safety drill.According to Equality Stafford, the incident took place during a “lockdown” drill at an undisclosed school on 28 September 2018.  The student, a transgender girl, was taking part in the drill during her physical education class but was not allowed to take shelter in a locker room alongside her fellow students. Equality Stafford noted that the teachers themselves were not to blame, saying: “It is important to highlight that the child’s PE teachers are not the bad guys. They are teachers without guidance in a county without guidance for these issues. They were following that they were told to do.”The post has been shared more than 1,200 times on Facebook since being published on 3 October 2018:A spokesperson for Stafford County Public Schools (SCPS), Sherrie Johnson, released a statement saying that the incident was under review:The story was also picked up by local and national news outlets, and we contacted Equality Stafford seeking more information. One of the group’s leaders, Lesley Woods, has said that the Facebook post was based on information provided by the girl’s family, adding: “This is nothing new for the family. They are a solid family and they are very much in support of their child, and they are really solid advocates for the community. So I would say all in all, the rest of us are shocked and appalled and motivated to come and speak and learn, but this family, this is their life everyday.”During a school board meeting on 9 October 2018, a family friend read a statement from the girl asking school staff to stop treating her like a predator, saying: “If there was someone armed in my school, I would have been the first one gone. I felt like an afterthought. If the whole thing wasn’t bad enough, the embarrassment caused me to have a panic attack in front of everyone.”Superintendent Scott Kizner did not approve any specific policies regarding inclusion of LGBTQ students but reiterated that the district would review their current guidelines and make changes at necessary. “We did not live up to my unwavering expectation that every child and adult—regardless of race, religion, color, disability, gender and sexual orientation is treated with respect and dignity,” Kizner said during the meeting. “And for that I apologize to the student, the family and the Stafford community.”In March 2015, the same school board voted not to allow another transgender student, a fourth-grader, to use a restroom according to their gender identity after receiving complaints from both parents and local politicians.

        "evidence": "In the first half of 2018, gun violence re-emerged as a major political social issue in the United States amidst a series of high-profile mass shootings, including the 14 February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left seventeen students and staff dead (and a like number wounded).In the wake of a 28 June shooting spree at the offices of the  newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, public attention once again turned to some of the statistics involved in mass shootings and gun violence in the United States.On 2 July, the hyperpartisan left-wing Occupy Democrats Facebook page posted a widely-shared meme that made some striking factual claims about the race and gender dimensions of mass shootings, claiming that of the “154 mass shootings this year … not one [was] committed by a black man or an illegal alien … [or] by a woman, either”:The meme didn’t cite any specific sources, but the number of shootings it cited (154) strongly indicated that it was based on data collected by the Gun Violence Archive, a Washington D.C.-based non-profit that tracks and records gun violence. In the aftermath of the  shooting, reports by NBC and  stated that that incident marked the 154th mass shooting of the year so far, and latter attributed that figure to the Gun Violence Archive.Categorizing and measuring gun violence — especially mass shootings — is therefore notoriously difficult due to varying definitions and incomplete data collection.No uniformly accepted definition of “mass shooting” exists. Historically, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) defined what they call “active shooter incidents” as those that result in four or more people (not including the attacker) being shot dead in public through actions not related to terrorism, gang activity, or the commission of other crimes (such as robbery). Since 2013, the FBI has dropped that numerical threshold to incidents involving the deaths of three or more people.Everytown for Gun Control, a pro-gun control non-profit that collects data on shootings, also defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are killed (not including the shooter) but includes shootings taking place in private homes, a circumstance the FBI omits from their methodology. magazine, in their mass shootings database, defines such shootings as “indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker.”Stanford University’s now-defunct Mass Shootings in America project defined a mass shooting as one in which three or more people were shot (but not necessarily killed), excluding the attacker. Stanford’s definition excluded gang-, drug-, or organized crime-related shootings.The Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced project, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot, including the attacker.Of the major sources of data about mass shootings, the Gun Violence Archive has a relatively inclusive definition: “If four or more people are shot or killed in a single incident, not [including] the shooter, that incident is categorized as a mass shooting based purely on that numerical threshold.” This includes shootings in private places, incidents involving gang activity and armed robbery, shootouts, and non-fatal shootings.These widely varying definitions explain why the Gun Violence Archive charted the number of mass shootings between 1 January and 28 June 2018 at above 150, while Mother Jones, for example, put it at a mere six.We’re going to evaluate the Occupy Democrats meme first on its own terms — that is, using the apparent source of the claim, the Gun Violence Archive — and then examine it against some of the other major sources of data we have mentioned above.The meme makes four claims: that 154 mass shootings took place between 1 January and 28 June 2018; that black men didn’t perpetrate any of them; that “illegal aliens” (undocumented immigrants) didn’t perpetrate any of them; and that women didn’t perpetrate any of them. (A spreadsheet containing our analysis can be downloaded here.)We downloaded the Gun Violence Archive’s mass shootings database after the 28 June attack at the  newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, and thoroughly analyzed each incident, using news reports, police statements, and court and prison records to attempt to verify the race, gender, and immigration status of suspected perpetrators in every case. This is what we found.The Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as an occurrence in which four or more people (not including the attacker) are shot in a single incident, and they charted 153 such shootings occurring between 1 January and 28 June 2018. Using their definition and data, we find that:No cases of mass shootings taking place in 2018 through 28 June had yet resulted in any convictions as of 9 July 2018, so definitive identifications of mass shooting perpetrators (along with their race, gender, or immigration status) cannot yet be made. However, it is quite likely that at least some of the suspects so far charged with involvement in mass shootings will eventually be convicted, so it is also quite likely that at least some of the crimes defined by the Gun Violence Archive as mass shootings will prove to have been perpetrated by black men, contrary to the meme’s claim.In fact, the trend is highly likely to be the opposite of that presented by Occupy Democrats, at least as far as the Gun Violence Archive data is concerned. Of the 59 named individuals suspected of involvement in mass shootings, two-thirds (40) were black men. Furthermore, many of the cases in which a suspect hadn’t yet been identified or charged involved gang-related shootings taking place in predominantly black communities, with exclusively black victims.Violent crime, including gun crime, is highly racially linked in the United States. According to Department of Justice research, an estimated 83 percent of violent gun crimes involving black victims between 2012 and 2015 were perpetrated by black assailants. So it would be statistically unlikely that many of the remaining 102 mass shootings involving black victims did not also involve black perpetrators.Although we did not find any evidence that an undocumented immigrant was involved in any mass shooting, it is important to note that police statements, arrest warrants, criminal complaints, and prison records do not routinely specify a suspect’s immigration status in the same way that they routinely specify the gender, race/ethnicity, and physical characteristics of a suspect.We checked multiple news releases published by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) but did not find any instances in which an undocumented immigrant was suspected of or charged with involvement in an attack that would match the Gun Violence Archive’s definition of a mass shooting.In one case, an undocumented immigrant named Arnoldo Pompa-Rascon was charged in relation to a series of three non-fatal shootings on the same day in Kansas City, Missouri. However, that case would not qualify as a mass shooting under the Gun Violence Archive’s definition because it involved fewer than four victims, and the shootings did not take place in “one incident.”Similarly, the high-profile shooting at YouTube’s San Bruno, California, campus in April 2018 was perpetrated by a woman, Nasim Najafi Aghdam, but because she shot three people (i.e., fewer than four) before taking her own life, this incident was not counted by the Gun Violence Archive.This source defines mass shootings as “indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker,” and using their definition and data we find:This source defines mass shootings as incidents in which four or more people — potentially including the attacker — are shot (but not necessarily killed) in a single spree, and using their definition and data we find:The major difference in definitions between the Gun Violence Archive and the Mass Shooting Tracker is clearly (and tragically) borne out in the widely differing lists of incidents. Both sources have a numerical threshold of four victims, but only the Mass Shooting Tracker includes shooters themselves as victims, resulting in many entries in that source’s database which don’t appear in others.This trend was particularly prevalent among white suspects. Of the 30 white shooting suspects (male and female), more than half (16) took their own lives. All but one of those 16 suicides came after a suspect first killed at least one family member.We found no evidence of an undocumented immigrant’s having been directly involved in any of the incidents recorded by the Mass Shooting Tracker, but it should be again noted again that a suspect’s immigration status is not routinely published in police statements, jail records, or court documents.How a mass shooting is defined has a significant bearing on the statistics we often see on television and read about in the news. Too often, those nuanced distinctions and varying methodologies are not made clear.The Occupy Democrats meme, like much social media commentary on gun violence, does not serve the public well in presenting a full and accurate picture of the facts. The source it relied upon for the figure of 154 mass shootings, the Gun Violence Archive, includes 102 incidents in which the demographic profiles of the suspects are uncertain, so in most cases we can’t glean anything definitive about the race, gender or immigration status of mass shooting perpetrators. Nonetheless, in those cases where suspects were identified, two-thirds of them were black men, a fact that significantly undermines the credibility of the meme.When we widen the definition to include shooters themselves as victims (as the Mass Shooting Tracker does), we observe a pattern of murder-suicides and family annihilations not represented in other sources — one which includes five female suspects (and little doubt among investigators about their culpability). And once again, black men represented a majority (58) of the 97 named suspects in the cases listed by the Mass Shooting Tracker. These two facts also significantly undermine the credibility of the Occupy Democrats meme. When we consulted the  database, a source that strips away non-fatal, non-public, and gang-related mass shootings, we are left with only six incidents between 1 January and 28 June 2018. In five of those, the suspect was a white man, and in the remaining case the suspect was an Asian-American man. The absence of black, immigrant and female perpetrators from this list speaks in favor of the meme, but the total number of incidents (six) means it has little relevance to the 154 mass shootings mentioned by Occupy Democrats.",

The legal excerpt cited in the tweet was taken from a 29 July 2016 decision by the the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit which struck down the voter ID law:The decision overturned a district court ruling upholding the state voter ID law. Writing for the 4th Circuit, Judge Diana Gribbon called the prior decision “erroneous”:According to Gribbon, the 4th Circuit court concluded “that the General Assembly would not have eliminated same-day registration entirely but for its disproportionate impact on African Americans,” and said that parts of the law amounted to solutions in search of a problem:In May 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court opted not to hear an appeal of the lower court’s ruling:",

        "evidence": "The use of child labor in cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where nearly 60% of the world’s cobalt is currently produced, is certainly a major issue that deserves the attention of consumers, corporations, and governments. However, some media outlets and social media users have distorted the issue into a rallying cry against the use of electric cars and clean energy.\nIn February 2017, an investigation by Sky News revealed that children as young as 4 years old were working in horrid conditions in cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC):\nWhile the news outlet reported that cobalt was an “essential part of most mobile gadgets sold around the world,” the Daily Mail seized on another use of cobalt, the manufacturing of electric car batteries, when it repackaged the Sky News report in an August 2017 article entitled: “Child miners aged four living a hell on Earth so YOU can drive an electric car: Awful human cost in squalid Congo cobalt mine that Michael Gove didn’t consider in his ‘clean’ energy crusade.”\nThe headline of the Daily Mail article may have left some readers with the impression that cobalt is used solely in the manufacturing of electric car batteries. This chemical, however, is also used to manufacture rechargeable batteries in cellphones, laptops, tablets, and other electronics. The Cobalt Institute reports that about 42% of all cobalt produced globally can be found in these rechargeable batteries. A quarter of that, according to a February 2018 article on Phys.org, is used for electric car batteries. In other words, only about 10% of all cobalt produced globally is used in electric car batteries.\nThe remaining 58% of the cobalt produced globally is used in industrial and military applications (super alloys, catalysts, magnets, and pigments, among others). \nThe Daily Mail article also stated that “almost every big motor manufacturer striving to produce millions of electric vehicles buys its cobalt from the impoverished central African state,” but that is also misleading, because many electric car manufacturers have committed to procuring their cobalt from ethical sources. BMW, for instance, recently stated that it will purchase all of its cobalt from Australia and Morocco to ensure that child labor isn’t used in the mining of this material. \nBMW also insists on transparency in every step of the supply chain in order to ensure that the cobalt it procures comes from an ethical source:\nThe BMW Group currently only obtains cobalt directly through the purchase of battery cells. However, taking all stages of the value chain into account is an integral part of the company’s corporate strategy. For this reason, the BMW Group also examines the origin of this raw material very closely and critically. This applies above all to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, from where two thirds of the quantities required worldwide originate.\n“We are working intensively on measures to ensure that our suppliers and their supply chain also consistently comply with the social and environmental standards we expect. This is currently only guaranteed in large-scale industrial mining. However, around 20 percent of cobalt produced in the Congo originates from artisanal mines where workers mine cobalt on a small scale using simple tools,” says Claudia Becker, expert for sustainable purchasing at the BMW Group.\nIn order to prevent cobalt mined under adverse social and ecological conditions from being used by the BMW Group for batteries in the BMW i3 or the BMW i8 for example, the company demands absolute transparency – above all from every stage of the cobalt supply chain: “We only accept companies that extract cobalt from mines where employees are protected,” emphasizes Becker. Moreover, BMW regularly publishes information on cobalt smelters and the raw material’s countries of origin.\nTesla has also been working to both reduce the amount of cobalt needed to manufacture its batteries and to procure cobalt from more ethical sources. Since 2012, Tesla has reduced the amount of cobalt in its batteries from 60% to just 3%. Company Founder Elon Musk has also stated that he is hoping to eliminate cobalt altogether in the company’s next generation of batteries. Tesla has also committed to sourcing its cobalt from more ethical sources in North America.\nSome industry experts, however, have expressed doubts that Tesla will be able to achieve these goals. Caspar Rawles, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence who focuses on the cobalt market, told The Verge in June 2018:\nA lot of companies, including Tesla, are interested in making the zero-cobalt battery. When do you think that will happen?\nTesla uses a formulation called NCA (nickel, cobalt, aluminum) that is already very low-cobalt. Over the last six years, Tesla and Panasonic [which supplies batteries to Tesla] have reduced cobalt dependency by about 60 percent already. That’s already very low. We think it’s going to be difficult for them to go much lower because you run into engineering problems.\nIn sum, it’s true that the majority of the world’s cobalt supply comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where numerous reports of child-labor and human-rights abuses have been uncovered. It’s also true that cobalt is a chemical element that is used in electric car batteries. However, it’s misleading to claim that these children are “living a hell on Earth so YOU can drive an electric car,” because the majority of cobalt is not used for electric car batteries, and electric car manufacturers, such as Tesla and BMW, procure their cobalt from sources outside of the DRC. ",

While viewers were undoubtedly aware that this footage didn’t actually show a real mythical creature’s visit to a ball game, some social media users seemed a bit confused about what this video actually showed. Is it a hologram? CGI? Virtual reality?\nAt the opening of the South Korean baseball championship they used a 3D hologram using 5G technology. Realistic Dragon flew over the stadium.\nJust unbelieveble!!! pic.twitter.com/y3jR64aXXB\n— Godfather IV (@godfatheriv) August 13, 2019\n\nThis video shows an augmented reality (AR) dragon. AR, which refers to technology that mixes the real world with computer-generated (CGI) images, is different from virtual reality (VR), the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. Unlike a hologram, the CGI objects can only be seen via some sort of screen:\nAccording to information from Live Science and The Franklin Institute, respectively: \nAugmented reality is the result of using technology to superimpose information — sounds, images and text — on the world we see. Picture the “Minority Report” or “Iron Man” style of interactivity. \nAugmented reality (AR) is one of the biggest technology trends right now, and it’s only going to get bigger as AR ready smartphones and other devices become more accessible around the world. AR let us see the real-life environment right in front of us — trees swaying in the park, dogs chasing balls, kids playing soccer — with a digital augmentation overlaid on it. For example, a pterodactyl might be seen landing in the trees, the dogs could be mingling with their cartoon counterparts, and the kids could be seen kicking past an alien spacecraft on their way to score a goal.\nIn other words, this dragon didn’t actually “fly over” this stadium. It was only viewable via a screen. \nThis video was created by the company SK Telecom for the SK Wyverns’ opening day (a wyvern is a “winged two-legged dragon with a barbed tail”) of the 2019 Korean Baseball Organization season. The dragon was visible on the stadium’s large LED screen and home televisions. While the people at this game couldn’t see this dragon with the naked eye, they were able to see this mythical beast via their phones. \nKorea.com reported that fans could also interact with the dragon by pressing the “cheer button” on a smartphone app:\nAn augmented reality (AR) image of a wyvern, a mythical dragon-like creature, on March 23 suddenly appeared on the opening day of the 2019 Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) season at Incheon’s SK Happy Dream Park, home of the defending league champions SK Wyverns.\nAn image of the team’s mascot was shown on the world’s largest LED baseball scoreboard at the stadium. In addition, the flying creature put on an interactive performance when fans pressed the cheer button on a smartphone app. Fans who watched the event on TV or their smartphones could also see this high-tech spectacle.\n\nFor the wyvern’s performance, SK used its self-developed AR and virtual reality (VR) technologies such as eSpace, a hyperspace platform for replicating the real world in cyberspace, and T real Platform, which enables AR content to be freely created and shared. The use of the latest 5G wireless technology also allowed large-scale AR streaming.\nA second video of this augmented reality dragon was posted to the SK Telecom YouTube page.

        "evidence": "In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that they would be canceling a contract with a company called Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc. (ABR) to procure fetal tissue for federal medical research projects. The department alleged that they were not “sufficiently assured that the contract included the appropriate protections applicable to fetal tissue research or met all other procurement requirements.”Using this development as pretext, HHS announced that they would additionally be conducting “a comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue to ensure consistency with statutes and regulations governing such research, and to ensure the adequacy of procedures and oversight of this research in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved” — in effect putting a “pause” on all research that relied on fetal tissue.ABR supplied fetal tissue to two National Institutes of Health [NIH] laboratories, one of which uses the material to create what are known as humanized mice. In a broad sense, these mice have been bred, with the help of fetal human tissue, to express a human immune response, making them a cost-effective way to test the efficacy of immunotherapeutic drugs:ABR had been the supplier of fetal tissue to NIH’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Montana, which had been using humanized mice to test potential HIV therapies. In a grant report on that laboratory’s efforts to study HIV using humanized-mouse models during the 2016 fiscal year, NIH scientist Kim Hasenkrug indicated strong potential for their research methods to aid in the search for new treatments for HIV:Warner Greene, the director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research in San Francisco, had been collaborating with RML to test potential antibody therapies on humanized mice, and he first told  that the HHS “pause” on fetal tissue procurement meant that the researchers could not guarantee enough mice to complete a statistically robust study. In a phone call, he explained to us that:Speaking to  Greene said that “Hasenkrug had not yet launched the experiment, and [RML’s] supplies of existing mice were too small to conduct the repeated experiments required to reach convincing scientific conclusions.” In a 9 December 2018 statement provided to  after the publication’s original 7 December 2018 reporting, HHS acknowledged that they had (at least temporarily) blocked staff scientists from procuring fetal tissue, but that they did not think — or realize — such a move would have affected the study in question:In his interview with us, Greene stated that this explanation made no sense. “To my knowledge … we were never made aware that we should approach the NIH to inform them of our need for more fetal tissue to complete this investigation.” If such a request were required, Greene said, he and his team would have “acted upon it in a millisecond.” We also reached out to the director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which oversees the Rocky Mountain Laboratory) for an update on the current status of the project and for clarification on the fetal tissue review’s impact on the study but have not received a response.However, as HHS has acknowledged both that they “put a pause in place” on fetal tissue procurement, and that this pause resulted in the inability of a trial seeking an HIV cure to move forward, it is factual to state that the Trump administration’s policies shut down (at least temporarily) scientists’ efforts to find a cure for HIV. Greene told us that NIH has been extremely supportive of their work, and that he feels that this change is “clearly a policy that’s … reflective of a new political situation in Washington, D.C., that’s now impacting our science.”Greene is one of many who viewed the 24 September announcement regarding fetal tissue research as a proxy debate over abortion. Chronologically, the announcement that the federal government would cut ties with ABR followed a campaign by several anti-abortion groups who explicitly sought to have the government cancel its contract with ABR, as reported in :Greene told us that after much internal debate, he and Hasenkrug plan on running that initial experiment anyway, with the hopes that the political climate will change in their favor come January 2019.",

        "evidence": "On Aug. 25, 2020 — one day after a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was captured on cell phone video shooting Jacob Blake, a Black man, multiple times as he was trying to enter his vehicle — social media users shared a video of what they said showed the aftermath of protests decrying the shooting.\nThe footage showed smoke rising from, the posts alleged, a facility run by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC) in Kenosha. Racial justice activist Shaun King, for example, shared the clip on Facebook with the caption: “In Kenosha, protestors burned down the ENTIRE Department of Corrections compound. And spray painted the question ‘Are you listening yet?’ on what remains.”\nThe Wisconsin Department of Corrections building was set on fire during the second night of unrest in Kenosha. Reduced to rubble and ashes. This video was recorded before bulldozers were brought in. @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/x0voJ2xF4I\n— Vi Nguyen (@ViNguyen) August 25, 2020\n\nTo unpack the legitimacy of the claim, we considered it two-pronged: a facility run by the DOC in Kenosha was set on fire during the August 2020 protests against racism in policing, and the flames and smoke damage completely — not partially — destroyed the building.\nFirst, we considered the addresses of properties run by the DOC in Kenosha, specifically an office for processing paroles and probations, called the Community Corrections Division, at 1212 60th St., and the Kenosha Correctional Center, which is a prison that can house up to 115 male inmates, at 6353 14th Ave.\nA photograph taken by Ashlee Rezin Garcia, a Chicago Sun-Times photojournalist, showed a Kenosha building ablaze and confirmed it was the probation and parole office, not the prison, that was along the route of the protests on Aug. 24.\nNext, we considered Google Maps footage, which was captured in July 2012, to determine if the site depicted in the viral video was indeed the property on 60th Street. Several architectural elements such as the property’s landscaping and building design seen on Google Maps’ street view matched what was shown in the clip, eliminating any speculation that the video erroneously showed rubble and damage from a site that was not a DOC-operated facility in Kenosha.\nSo to recap, it was true to claim a DOC-run office in Kenosha was set on fire during the protests, and the viral video indeed depicted the aftermath of that site’s damage.\nAfter that, we sought any evidence to confirm or deny that the fire destroyed the entire building.\nSnopes presented the question to the DOC’S Office of Public Affairs, and Deputy Director of Communications Anna Neal responded to our inquiry with an email, which explained staff had indeed used the building to meet with people on probation, parole, or other types of court-mandated supervision. But since the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, she wrote, most staff had been working remotely, not in the office. Neal added:\nThe building was burned down and unfortunately was a total loss, however we are happy to note there was no one in the building at the time of the incident and there are no staff injuries reported. […] All essential operations are still being conducted, and public safety remains our number one priority.\nIn sum, considering the accurate documentation of the fire and its aftermath, as well as confirmation from a DOC spokesperson that the building sustained irreparable fire damage, we rate this claim “True.”",

Guy was a fucking loser.”\nAs the article spread on social media, President Trump took to Twitter to issue a denial, and said that he never called McCain a loser:\n\nWhile Trump writes that he “never called John [McCain] a loser,” this simply isn’t true. In fact, Trump himself once tweeted an article quoting Trump saying that McCain was a loser.\n\nThe article Trump shared in July 2015 was referring to an appearance then-candidate Trump made at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa. Conservative pollster Frank Luntz asked Trump if it was appropriate for a man running for the country’s highest office to refer to McCain — a war hero and navy pilot who became a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down over Vietnam — as a “dummy.”\nTrump said: “He lost [the 2008 election], so I never liked him as much after that because I don’t like losers.” \nWhen Luntz repeated that McCain was a war hero, Trump said: “He’s not a war hero.

It is part of a longer piece of text shared to his personal Facebook page on the night of the shooting. The entire statement can be viewed below or here on Wiles’ Facebook page. We’ve highlighted the portion of this message that went viral on social media:\nToday, El Paso families went to the store to shop as they have done many times in the past, but this time 20 El Pasoans never made it home and many others are fighting for their lives.\nFirst of all, I want to say that I have never been more proud of the El Paso Police Department than I am today. Their response to this dangerous and chaotic situation, as well as the arrest of the individual responsible, was nothing short of heroic. I would also be remiss if I did not mention all the other agencies (to include the El Paso County Sheriffs Office) that assisted and had the same heroic intentions as they searched for this armed subject, placing themselves in potential danger. Law enforcement in El Paso showed the entire nation what we are willing to do to protect our community.\nBut, like the rest of you, I am sad and hurt at the loss of innocent lives and the struggle their families are going through and will go through for years to come. Those who are injured and their families and how they are holding on to a hope that everything will be okay even though they will never be the same again. We are talking about innocent men, women and children.\nSo your first question may be why? Why in this great diverse city would someone come in from the outside to take the lives of our brothers and sisters.\nI love El Paso and it’s diversity and believe that being raised here made me and my children who we are today. And I thank God for that.\nBut what happened today is beyond comprehension. This Anglo man came here to kill Hispanics. I’m outraged and you should be too. This entire nation should be outraged. In this day and age, with all the serious issues we face, we are still confronted with people who will kill another for the sole reason of the color of their skin.\nI fear things will not get better. Not pointing out anyone in particular, but I’m sick of people jumping in front of the cameras offering prayers and condolences as things just keep getting worse.\nIt’s time to rise up and hold our representatives accountable at all levels. I want representatives who will stand up against racism. Who will stand up and support the diversity of our nation and our state. Who will stand up for a strong criminal justice system that holds criminals responsible and keeps violent individuals locked up and off our streets. Who support robust community mental health services. Who support keeping guns out of the hands of people who are just waiting for an opportunity to kill others.\nEl Paso will never be the same, because a racist came to our city to try and make a point. It didn’t work though, because the backlash of this community, as we hold national, state and local politicians accountable, will be the only point that will be made.\nTo be clear, Wiles posted this message to his personal Facebook page — the El Paso County sheriff did not release this statement via the department’s official social media channels.  \nAccording to the El Paso Times, Wiles has been the El Paso County sheriff since 2009. Before that, he was the chief of the El Paso Police Department.",

        "evidence": "One of the many political controversies surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 was U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated touting of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine for treatment of the coronavirus disease, despite a lack of scientific studies and evidence demonstrating its effectiveness for that purpose.\nOne item that circulated on social media played on that controversy by purporting to show two seemingly contradictory CNN articles about hydroxychloroquine, published three months apart and co-authored by the same person. One criticized Trump for being “wrong” about hydroxychloroquine, and the other acknowledged that a study had found hydroxychloroquine helpful in treating coronavirus patients:\n\nHowever, these articles were not contradictory in content, and they were presented in a misleading manner in the above example to make them seem so.\nThe first article, published on April 11, 2020, and written by Elizabeth Cohen and Dr. Minali Nigam, was headlined “President Trump is wrong in so many ways about hydroxychloroquine studies. Here are the facts.” This article did not assert that hydroxychloroquine had no value whatsoever as a treatment for the coronavirus disease. Rather, it pointed out four specific ways in which Trump had made claims about hydroxychloroquine studies that were contrary to what doctors were expressing about the subject at the time:\n1) How soon until we know if hydroxychloroquine works against coronavirus? Trump says “days.” Doctors say weeks or months.\n2) French researchers have already done a clinical study showing hydroxychloroquine works as a treatment for coronavirus. Doesn’t that tell us something? Trump says yes. Doctors say the study was terrible, so no.\n3) Have some people tried to delay hydroxychloroquine clinical trials? Trump says yes, and he came to the rescue. Doctors say they have no idea what he’s talking about.\n4) Is hydroxychloroquine safe for coronavirus patients? Trump says yes. Doctors say the drug can have serious side effects.\nThe second article, published on July 3 2020, and written by Maggie Fox, Andrea Kane, and Elizabeth Cohen, had its headline deceptively truncated in the above example to remove the skepticism it expressed about a recent hydroxychloroquine study. The full headline read “Study finds hydroxychloroquine may have boosted survival, but other researchers have doubts,” and the text of the article detailed the dispute over the study’s findings:\nA surprising new study found the controversial antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine helped patients better survive in the hospital. But the findings, like the federal government’s use of the drug itself, were disputed.\nA team at Henry Ford Health System in southeast Michigan said their study of 2,541 hospitalized patients found that those given hydroxychloroquine were much less likely to die.\nt’s a surprising finding because several other studies have found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine, a drug originally developed to treat and prevent malaria. President Donald Trump touted the drug heavily, but later studies found not only did patients not do better if they got the drug, they were more likely to suffer cardiac side effects.\nResearchers not involved in the Henry Ford study pointed out it wasn’t of the same quality of the studies showing hydroxychloroquine did not help patients, and said other treatments, such as the use of the steroid dexamethasone, might have accounted for the better survival of some patients … They noted that the Henry Ford team did not randomly treat patients but selected them for various treatments based on certain criteria.\n[Eli Rosenberg, associate professor of epidemiology at the University at Albany School of Public Health] also pointed out that the Detroit paper excluded 267 patients — nearly 10% of the study population — who had not yet been discharged from the hospital.\nHe said this might have skewed the results to make hydroxychloroquine look better than it really was. Those patients might have still been in the hospital because they were very sick, and if they died, excluding them from the study made hydroxychloroquine look like more of a lifesaver than it really was.\n“There’s a little bit of loosey-goosiness here in all this,” he told CNN.\nOther analyst likewise found the hydroxychloroquine study referenced by CNN to be dubious, for similar reasons:\nThe study that sparked the latest controversy was anything but randomized. Not only was it not randomized, outside experts noted, but patients who received hydroxychloroquine were also more likely to get steroids, which appear to help very sick patients with Covid-19. That is likely to have influenced the central finding of the Henry Ford study: that death rates were 50% lower among patients in hospitals treated with hydroxychloroquine.\nEvidence that hydroxychloroquine does not help hospitalized patients — the use in its original emergency use authorization, which was designed to allow doctors to access a national stockpile of the drug — is mounting.\nSaid [Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic and a longtime clinical trialist]: “The sooner we stop talking about hydroxychloroquine, the sooner we can focus attention on more promising therapies.”\nIn short, information about hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, published by CNN in two articles in April and July of 2020, was neither contradictory nor inaccurate — despite deceptive attempts to make it look that way.",

        "evidence": "As the 4th of July approached in 2018, some social media users were surprised to learn about the existence of “silent fireworks” when they came across an article published by the web site “DogTime” a few years prior about a town in Italy which had supposedly switched to these seemingly noiseless pyrotechnic displays:The phrase “silent fireworks,” however, is a bit misleading.Many readers seemed to come away with the impression that these “silent fireworks” would appear just as big and bright as traditional fireworks, but without the loud explosive booms normally associated with them. That’s not the case, however: No matter how advanced pyrotechnicians may be at developing fireworks, they haven’t quite yet figured out a way to remove noise from these large explosions.In fact, these “silent firework” displays (which are probably better described as “reduced noise” displays) don’t typically include the big aerial explosions found in traditional fireworks shows. Rather than employing some new form of pyrotechnology that dampens the noise of traditional fireworks, such “quiet” displays mostly make selective use of existing non-loud forms of fireworks:As such, these types of displays are generally more appropriate for smaller crowds rather than for large, city-wide celebrations:Although many readers may have only recently learned about the concept of “silent fireworks,” most of them have probably already seen forms of these relatively noiseless displays, such as roman candles and sparklers.Here’s a video of the “flying fish” firework referenced above:Thus, reports about “silent fireworks” are less about the development of new noiseless products and more about how some towns are focusing on putting on quieter displays. These shows range from nearly silent displays featuring large sparklers, fountains, and roman candles, to aerial shows that employ most everything other than the massively loud aerial “skyrocket” shells.Paul Singh, the director of Epic Fireworks in England, said that his quiet firework displays are typically softer than the accompanying music and are well below the 120 decibel limit placed on fireworks sold in the UK:A 2012 video from Gala Fireworks shows just how quiet (or loud) these “silent firework” displays can be. This footage was taken during a wedding at Browsholme Hall in England, and the company explained that they used “low-noise” fireworks because the venue was surrounded by farm land and they didn’t want to scare the livestock:Although companies may bill these displays as “silent” or “quiet,” the fireworks can still generate a good bit of noise. In fact, when the Birmingham Botanical Gardens advertised a quieter fireworks show in 2015, a number of parents still complained that the “silent” explosions were far too loud:So, the term “silent fireworks” does not refer to a new form of firework that produces huge explosions with little or no noise, but rather to shows that selectively utilize existing forms of relatively quiet fireworks.",

        "evidence": "In the first quarter of 2019, internet users because encountering a somewhat unusual website that appeared to be the official “Biden 2020” U.S. presidential campaign site for former vice president Joe Biden. The website, at joebiden.info appeared slick and professional and appearance, but the material it offered was rather odd: pictures and animated GIFs of Biden touching and kissing women and young girls; a 2012 quote from Biden stating that “I promise you, the president has a big stick”; and sections highlighting Biden’s purported policy positions of having been “AGAINST Gay Marriage, FOR Mass Incarceration, AGAINST Abortion Rights, AGAINST School Busing, FOR Iraq War, and FOR Death Penalty & Harsh Drug Sentences”:\nAll of this was topped off by a notice to viewers that “Uncle Joe is back and ready to take a hands-on approach to America’s problems! Joe Biden has a good feel for the American people and knows exactly what they really want deep down. He’s happy to open up and reveal himself to voters and will give a pounding to anybody who gets in his way!” — references to Biden’s supposed “groping problem“:\n\nOnly in tiny type at the bottom of the page did the site inform readers that it was “political commentary and parody of Joe Biden’s Presidential campaign website” and was “not Joe Biden’s actual website.”\nThat disclaimer merely stated that the parody site was “a project BY AN American citizen FOR American citizens” without disclosing its creator’s identity. But a New York Times article of June 29, 2019, revealed the website to be the work of Patrick Mauldin, who runs the Republican political consulting firm Vici Media Group (not to be confused with Vici Media Inc. of Philadelphia) and has created content for Donald Trump’s presidential campaigns:\nThe Biden website was intended to help Democrats “face facts,” Mr. Mauldin said in an interview. He kept his name off it because “people tend to dismiss things that they don’t like, especially if it comes from the opposite side,” he said.\nYet in anonymously trying to exploit the fissures within the Democratic ranks — fissures that ran through [Democratic] debates — Mr. Mauldin’s website hews far closer to the disinformation spread by Russian trolls in 2016 than typical political messaging. With nothing to indicate its creator’s motives or employer, the website offers a preview of what election experts and national security officials say Americans can expect to be bombarded with for the next year and a half: anonymous and hard-to-trace digital messaging spread by sophisticated political operatives whose aim is to sow discord through deceit. Trolling, that is, as a political strategy.\nMr. Mauldin, who has not been previously identified as the creator of the website, said he had built and paid for it on his own, and not for the Trump campaign. But the campaign knows about the websites, raising the prospect that the president’s re-election effort condoned what is, in essence, a disinformation operation run by one of its own.\nTim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director, did not directly address that issue, though he said it was “great that talented supporters of President Trump use their time to help his re-election.”\n“We appreciate their efforts in their own time with parodies like this that help the cause,” he added.\nMauldin set up similar fake campaign websites for other Democratic candidates, including Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris. Biden campaign spokesperson T.J. Ducklo was quoted by the Times as saying the Biden campaign had been aware of the parody site but not the identity of its creator: “Imagine our surprise that a site full of obvious disinformation is the handiwork of an operative tied to the Trump campaign.”",

        "evidence": "The day before Thanksgiving 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted an altered image showing his head edited onto the body of the iconic fictional boxer played by Sylvester Stallone, Rocky Balboa, in the “Rocky” series of movies.\n\nThe event was surreal enough to prompt readers to inquire as to whether it was true that Trump posted the edited image. “Did Trump tweet a picture of his head on Rocky’s body,” one reader asked.\nTrump did post the image on Nov. 27, 2019, just before 5 a.m. to his Twitter account, but he did not include with it an explanation, leading to speculation, as Reuters reported:\n“Rocky IV,” in which Balboa beat Russian Ivan Drago, opened in theaters on this date in 1985, which could explain why Trump posted the image on Wednesday.\nTrump, however, did not include text in the post. Some in the media speculated that it was in reference to his ability to fight off controversy during the ongoing impeachment inquiry in Congress.\nOthers suggested that the image alluded to comments he made on Tuesday about his health during a rally in Florida, where he said doctors told him he had a “gorgeous chest” during a recent physical.\nWhatever Trump’s intention for tweeting the image, it took on its own meaning for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, who displayed it during a “Thanksgiving Rally” as an expression of gratitude for Trump’s signing of legislation, passed overwhelmingly by Congress, that supports the protesters and sanctions Chinese and Hong Kong officials who violate human rights. Trump had been reluctant to sign the legislation, but the bill passed both the U.S. House and Senate by “veto-proof majorities.”\nEdited images associated with Trump’s Twitter account are hardly unheard of. In October 2019, Trump tweeted an altered image of himself placing a medal on the image of Conan, the military dog injured in the operation that led to the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State terror group. The dog’s head had been edited in over that of James C. McCloughan, an Army medic previously honored for saving lives in the Vietnam war.\nIn 2017, Trump tweeted a video showing him tackling and beating up a man with the CNN logo edited onto his head. The source was a 2007 video in which Trump had made an appearance on World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he body-slammed WWE owner Vince McMahon.

        "evidence": "In the latter part of July 2020, some Twitter users began complaining that the social media platform was disabling accounts that used depictions of the six-pointed Star of David, a symbol of Judaism, branding such usage to be a display of “hateful imagery:”\nJust changed my background to that of @Racharley77’s icon photo. She was blocked by Twitter for ‘hateful imagery’ – a cute cartoon character and a #starofdavid. I also updated my profile – added a special hashtag to define the outrage. #AmYisraelChai – #TwitterSucks!! pic.twitter.com/hbVvnDnQSe\n— Jay Engelmayer (@jengelmayer) July 21, 2020\n\nArutz Sheva reported of the issue that:\nTwitter has now taken it a step too far. It is forcing Jews to take off any and all profile pictures with the Star of David in them. It will report the violation as ”hateful imagery.”\nAt first, I couldn’t believe this was happening. That it was a one-time mistake. That was until people sent me multiple screen shots of the same Twitter violation sent to them over having a Jewish Star of David in their profile pictures and [said] that this has happened before.\nWe are unsure if anti-Zionists are reporting these profile pictures to twitter, or if twitter is finding them by itself. Either way, someone on the twitter team is deeming the Star of David hateful imagery and forcing users to take their pictures down if they want to continue to use their platforms.\nTwitter explained via their Public Policy account that they had not intended to interfere with all depictions of the Star of David — specifically only those reminiscent of the yellow stars and badges used to identify Jews in Nazi Germany, symbols which are often employed in the modern era by anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi groups in a manner that violates Twitter’s Hateful Conduct Policy:\nWe want to clarify some questions about hateful imagery on Twitter. We categorically do not consider the Star of David as a hateful symbol or hateful image. We have for some time seen the 'yellow star' or ‘yellow badge’ symbol being used by those seeking to target Jewish people.\n— Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) July 22, 2020\n\nThis is a violation of the Twitter Rules, and our Hateful Conduct Policy prohibits the promotion of violence against – or threats of attack towards – people on the basis of categories such as religious affiliation, race and ethnic origin https://t.co/LWewatWedr\n— Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) July 22, 2020\n\nHowever, according to the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA), Twitter was “locking the accounts of users who display” the Star of David in their profiles even when such usage was not in violation of Twitter’s policies:\nTwitter has deemed the Star of David, a symbol of Judaism and Jewish pride, to be “hateful imagery”, and is locking the accounts of users who display it.\nSeveral Twitter users have contacted Campaign Against Antisemitism in recent days reporting that their accounts have been locked, and Twitter has provided the following rationale: “What happened? We have determined that this account violated the Twitter Rules. Specifically for: Violating our rules against posting hateful imagery. You may not use hateful images or symbols in your profile image or profile header. As a result, we have locked your account.”\nThe social media platform advises users that if they delete the “hateful imagery”, i.e. the Star of David, the account may be unlocked.\nThe Stars of David in the profile pictures of locked accounts vary from artistic blue Stars of David and graffitied white Stars of David to, most ironically, a portfolio of yellow Stars of David.\nArutz Sheva and others also stated that Twitter appeared to be taking action against accounts displaying the Star of David in ways that did not constitute “hateful conduct”:\nThe only time twitter mentions in its rules that A Star of David is considered hateful is [in] “images altered to include hateful symbols or references to a mass murder that targeted a protected category, e.g., manipulating images of individuals to include yellow Star of David badges, in reference to the Holocaust.” None of the users that were considered “in violation” of their rules had such a star. There’s also a fine print in the twitter rules that allows exceptions if it is for educational purposes. In no way did anyone violate the rules, but they have been punished for using a symbol that has such heartfelt meaning to the Jewish people.\nTwitter admitted they had erroneously taken action against some accounts displaying the Star of David, but that those instances were mistakes and had since been rectified:\nWhile the majority of cases were correctly actioned, some accounts highlighted recently were mistakes and have now been restored. \nWe're grateful to @antisemitism @ADL @CST_UK and others for bringing this to our attention and for their partnership in tackling antisemitism.\n— Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) July 22, 2020\n",

        "evidence": "In November 2017, the run-up to an election to fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat in Alabama became one of the most contentious political issues of the year when multiple women came forward and accused the Republican candidate, a former district attorney and state judge, of sexual assault.One of those women, Beverly Young Nelson, maintained that Moore had tried to force himself upon her when he was 30 and she was just a 16-year-old high school student:Moore claimed in response that he didn’t even know Nelson, but she offered a contrary piece of evidence documenting that he did — her high school yearbook, which Moore had signed below the inscription “To a sweeter, more beautiful girl I could not say ‘Merry Christmas'” just weeks before the alleged attack:Moore’s defenders, including attorney Philip Jauregui, contended that the yearbook inscription was a forgery, asserting that Moore’s signature had been lifted from a court document, that the handwriting appeared inconsistent in style, and that Moore would not have written “D.A.” after his name since he was only an assistant district attorney at the time:About three weeks later, Nelson admitted to a  reporter that she herself had added the wording below Moore’s name in order to “remind herself [of] who Roy Moore was, and where and when Mr. Moore signed her yearbook.”Critics immediately seized upon the admission and maintained that Nelson had “lied,” that she had “tampered with Moore’s signature,” and even that she had “admitted she forged the yearbook”:Although some misunderstanding or misrepresentation certainly surrounded Nelson’s claims, the language with which they were commonly characterized in right-wing news reports was itself hyperbolic and inaccurate. Nelson didn’t “lie” about the annotations (she hadn’t claimed that Moore had written them himself, although neither had she previously explained that he hadn’t), she didn’t “tamper” with Moore’s signature (other than possibly appending the abbreviation “D.A.” to it), and she didn’t “forge” (i.e., fraudulently create) any portion of the yearbook or its contents.Fox News, at least, corrected their account to note that Nelson had acknowledged adding notes to the yearbook rather than “forging” Moore’s inscription, as Fox had originally reported:At a subsequent news conference, Nelson’s lawyer, Gloria Allred, released the findings of a handwriting analyst who concluded that the signature on the yearbook inscription did indeed belong to Roy Moore.",

        "evidence": "In April 2020, millions of Americans who lost income due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic were waiting on promised relief payments from the United States government. So when news broke that U.S. President Donald Trump was making the “unprecedented” move of having his name added to these stimulus checks, a decision that could potentially delay the arrival of these checks by several days, many citizens took to social media to voice their displeasure, as in the example below:\n\nTrump’s name is truly being added to the COVID-19 stimulus checks, otherwise known as Economic Impact Payments. As of this writing, however, officials at the U.S. Treasury Department insist this will not result in any delays. \nThe Washington Post first reported on Trump’s decision on April 14, 2020. According to the news outlet, Trump’s name is expected to appear in the memo line of the check, not as the payment’s official signatory, and that this will be the “first time that a president’s name appears on an IRS disbursement”:\nThe Treasury Department has ordered President Trump’s name printed on stimulus checks the Internal Revenue Service is rushing to send to tens of millions of Americans, a process that could slow their delivery by a few days, senior IRS officials said.\nThe unprecedented decision, finalized late Monday, means that when recipients open the $1,200 paper checks the IRS is scheduled to begin sending to 70 million Americans in coming days, “President Donald J. Trump” will appear on the left side of the payment.\nIt will be the first time a president’s name appears on an IRS disbursement, whether a routine refund or one of the handful of checks the government has issued to taxpayers in recent decades either to stimulate a down economy or share the dividends of a strong one.\nTreasury officials disputed that the checks would be delayed.\nWhile Trump’s name will appear on these stimulus checks, we can’t predict whether these payments will be delayed or go out on time. A Treasury Department official said in a statement that “absolutely no delay whatsoever” would occur: \n“Economic Impact Payment checks are scheduled to go out on time and exactly as planned — there is absolutely no delay whatsoever … In fact, we expect the first checks to be in the mail early next week which is well in advance of when the first checks went out in 2008 and well in advance of initial estimates.”\nIt should also be noted that many Americans will be receiving their stimulus payments via a direct deposit. It’s unclear how many people will receive hard paper checks bearing Trump’s name and how many will receive a digital payment. \nAn IRS official told Fox News that the number of people who will receive paper checks was subject to a “number of variables, including how much info the IRS obtains through the Non-Filers Enter Payment Info web portal and the Get My Payment portal launching [April 15] at IRS.gov.“\nThese Economic Impact Payments were included in the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that Trump signed in late March 2020. According to the IRS, direct-deposit payments had already started going out as of the second week in April. Those waiting on a paper check, however, may not see their payments for several weeks. (If you’re waiting on a payment, you can check the status of your check on a recently launched web app from the IRS.)\nTo sum up: It is true that in April 2020, the U.S. government made the unprecedented move of adding the president’s name to stimulus checks issued by the IRS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although an IRS official said this could slow the process and delay the delivery of checks, Treasury officials insisted that the checks would still go out on schedule. ",

        "evidence": "U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings laid into Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan during a House Oversight Committee hearing on July 18, 2019, calling attention to the Trump administration’s treatment of migrant children after reports they were being held in filthy, overcrowded conditions at border-detention facilities.\nSo began a snowballing reaction from U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters that started with attacks on Cummings, a long-serving Democratic congressman who represents Baltimore, eventually leading to pointing fingers at unrelated comments Sen. Bernie Sanders made in 2015.\nCummings, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, gave an emotional response when Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said the immigration agencies he oversees are “doing our level best” to handle detained children at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n“What does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces, can’t take a shower?” Cummings asked, his voice rising. “None of us would have our children in that position.” He added, “They are human beings.”\n\nCummings was responding to news reports of neglect and squalor at migrant facilities that have included details that children “as young as 7 and 8, many of them wearing clothes caked with snot and tears, are caring for infants they’ve just met, the lawyers said. Toddlers without diapers are relieving themselves in their pants. Teenage mothers are wearing clothes stained with breast milk.”\nTrump responded to Cummings’ criticism of his administration’s treatment of migrants more than a week later by taking to Twitter to attack the congressman and the city of Baltimore, which is in Cummings’ district. The Twitter tirade, in which Trump called Baltimore “a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess,” prompted some people to renew ongoing criticism that his recent comments targeting non-white leaders are racist.\nTrump found a new angle on the topic on July 29, 2019, six minutes after hosts on the Fox News morning talk show “Fox & Friends” said during their broadcast that Sanders made disparaging comments about Baltimore while visiting the city in 2015.\n\nCrazy Bernie Sanders recently equated the City of Baltimore to a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY! Based on that statement, I assume that Bernie must now be labeled a Racist, just as a Republican would if he used that term and standard! The fact is, Baltimore can be brought back, maybe……\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2019\n\nTrump’s tweet is misleading in that Sanders’ comments weren’t recent, and the speech in which Sanders made them occurred in a different context. Trump’s complaint about being “labeled a Racist” reflects criticism he faced after he attacked several lawmakers of color, while Sanders, according to contemporaneous news reports, was attempting to win over potential black voters. The bulk of the race criticism came on July 14, 2019, after Trump tweeted that four female congresswomen, all of whom are people of color and U.S. citizens, should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.”\nSanders, an Independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats in Congress, gave the speech in question in Baltimore on Dec. 8, 2015. He said, “The fact of the matter is that America is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But anyone who took the walk that we took around this neighborhood would not think you’re in a wealthy nation. You would think that you’re in a third world country.”\nSanders was then, as he is as of this writing, running for president as a Democrat, and he gave the speech after he took a walking tour of the West Baltimore neighborhood where Freddie Gray was arrested. Gray died on April 19, 2015, from spinal cord injuries while in police custody, in a high-profile case that led to widespread anger and unrest over police violence directed at the black community.\nSanders’ speech was not the equivalent in content or context to Trump’s statement about Baltimore, despite efforts to paint it that way after the fact. Trump’s comments were an attack on a political opponent, Cummings, who is African-American and who represents a city with a large black community. Sanders’ speech, on the other hand, denounced structural racism in a reported effort to reach black voters.\nIn his speech, Sanders called out conditions in the community that were indicative of those faced by the broader African-American population, including economic inequality, higher unemployment, lack of educational opportunity, mass incarceration and even the lack of basic amenities, like grocery stores in some communities.\n“There is an enormous amount of work to be done and we have the people to do that work,” Sanders said (his full speech can be viewed here.) “What we need is changes in our national priorities and to stop ignoring those many, many millions of people who are hurting today, who are not receiving the kind of attention or redress that they are entitled to from their government.”\nIn contrast, Trump’s response to violence and unrest over the killing of Gray in 2015 was to blame then-President Barack Obama for it, again alluding to race.\nOur great African American President hasn’t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 28, 2015\n\nSanders responded on Twitter on July 29, 2019, to Trump’s comments about the 2015 speech:\nTrump’s lies and racism never end.\nWhile I have been fighting to lift the people of Baltimore and elsewhere out of poverty with good paying jobs, housing and health care, he has been attacking workers and the poor. https://t.co/7N0K4GQgEO\n— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 29, 2019\nAlthough it’s true that Sanders likened parts of Baltimore to a “third world country,” he made the comments while visiting that city on the heels of racial unrest there to make a broader point about the need to fight structural racism. Pointing to his quote to claim it’s the equivalent of Trump’s political attack on the black congressman who represents Baltimore is misleading. ",

It was presented as if it showed a genuine accident resulting in Smith’s teeth getting knocked out (Smith posted the video with the caption “And we never saw @jasonderulo again, to which Derulo responded, “I know a good dentist…text me back”), but we were a bit suspicious, to say the least, of the authenticity of this video. \nFor starters, Derulo and Smith have shared at least one other digitally manipulated video.

        "evidence": "In the summer of 2018, many Americans were alarmed to read about the phenomenon of young immigrant children, without free legal aid, having to plead their cases before a judge in deportation and asylum cases.  For example, in a 27 June article,the  reported that:This report prompted inquiries from multiple skeptical and concerned readers asking us if it was true.The referenced practice does occur today and has taken place for years. We spoke with immigration attorneys who confirmed that immigrant children subject to deportation or asylum hearings are not entitled to court-appointed lawyers, and they recalled having represented clients as young as two and three years old.In the United States, any defendant in a criminal case is constitutionally entitled to be represented by a court-appointed attorney at no cost if they cannot afford to hire their own. However, this constitutional guarantee does not extend to civil cases or immigration courts (although in some states and some circumstances, state law does entitle individuals to free legal aid in civil cases).Instead, those who find themselves before immigration courts, whether adults or children, have the right, if not always the wherewithal, to obtain legal representation from one of a number of non-profit organizations and law firms who work on a pro bono basis.Although defendants do not have a right to court-appointed free legal aid in immigration court, the federal government does indirectly contribute to their assistance. The Office for Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, contracts with the non-profit Vera Institute for Justice, which in turn sub-contracts with more than a dozen organizations around the country to provide free legal representation and advice to immigrants facing deportation and other legal issues.In April 2018, during the same week that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented the “zero tolerance” immigration policy, the Executive Office for Immigration Review — which oversees the U.S. immigration court system — reportedly informed the Vera Institute that these legal assistance programs were to be put on hold pending a cost-effectiveness review.Sessions later announced that the programs would not be paused, but a review of their costs would still be taking place.According to statistics collected by Syracuse University, 58,015 unaccompanied children (i.e., juveniles under the age of 18 separated from their legal adult guardians) were subjected to deportation hearings in American immigration courts in 2017.That figure was 61,254 in 2016, and 35,113 in 2015. Between 2005 and 2017, some 300,000 unaccompanied children have had to appear in court in deportation hearings, and according to the data around half of children in deportation cases do not have legal representation. A child who doesn’t have a lawyer is over four times more likely to receive a removal order (deportation) than a child who does. Between 2005 and May 2018, a total of 93,767 children left the United States, either through removal orders or voluntary departure, after being detained and subjected to immigration court deportation proceedings without legal representation.The figures from previous years, which related only  to unaccompanied children, can’t be directly compared to those from 2018, which do not distinguish between children who arrived into the United States unaccompanied and those who arrived with their parents and families.However, we know that the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy caused at least 2,342 children to be separated from their parents at the border, and since many of these children will be subject to deportation proceedings, it is quite plausible that an increase in the number of unaccompanied children appearing in immigration courts has occurred in 2018.In 2014, the American Immigration Council, the American Civil Liberties Union, and other non-profit organizations sued the U.S. government for alleged violations of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act, demanding that immigrant children be given court-appointed free legal aid in immigration proceedings.Thsee organizations brought suit () on behalf of fourteen immigrant children (some as young as four, three, or even one year old), all of whom were facing deportation hearings, before the case was certified as a class action and the group of plaintiffs expanded to thousands of children in similar circumstances. Attorneys for the children argued that:The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the lawsuit in 2016 on a question of jurisdiction and rejected a similar high-profile lawsuit in January 2018, leaving in place the status quo: thousands of children with no right to court-appointed attorneys in immigration court.Megan McKenna is communications director at Kids in Need of Defense, a charity devoted specifically to advancing and upholding the rights of children in immigration policy. She told us that the youngest child the organization had formally represented in immigration court was just two years old.No rules or guidelines currently in place establish a minimum age below which children can’t be forced to defend themselves in court, according to McKenna. The court does provide a translator, if necessary, but most protections and services for children are at the discretion of judges who can, for example, delay a hearing to give a child time to find legal representation but are not obliged to do so.McKenna described the process as “unforgiving,” adding that “They’re all coming for a very difficult reason. No child would come on their own, hundreds or thousands of miles, unless something was really wrong.”The debate over whether children (as opposed to adults) should be entitled to taxpayer-funded free legal aid in immigration cases partially revolves around the question of whether children, as a category, are less capable than adults of both understanding their circumstances and the questions put to them by a judge, performing the logical processes required to put together an argument on their own behalf, and verbalizing that argument with sufficient clarity and impact.In 2016, Jack Weil, a U.S. Justice Department official responsible for training immigration judges, sparked controversy with remarks he made during a deposition in the  class action case. Weil suggested that three- and four-year-old children could be “taught immigration law,” although he later maintained that his comments had been taken out of context. During Weil’s deposition, ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham questioned him as follows (page 69):We posed a series of questions to the U.S. Department of Justice relating to the presence of children in immigration courts, including whether any rules prevented children with intellectual disabilities from being ordered to defend themselves, what the specific criteria are for a judge to determine whether a child is capable of functioning in court, as well as the number unaccompanied children who have been subject to immigration court proceedings so far in 2018, but did not receive a response by press time.",

        "evidence": "After Illinois teen Kyle Rittenhouse was charged with fatally shooting two people and wounding another during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug. 25, 2020, Snopes received numerous inquiries from readers wondering if a self-described Christian crowdfunding website was hosting a fundraiser to supposedly help pay Rittenhouse’s legal defense.\nThe killings occurred during a chaotic confrontation between people protesting the Aug. 23 police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, and armed vigilantes who claimed to be patrolling the lakeside city to prevent looting and property destruction. Rittenhouse, 17, was captured in video footage carrying a military-style rifle, marching alongside members of the latter group, and putting his hands up after shots were fired. Authorities arrested him on Aug. 26 in connection with the deaths in Antioch, Illinois, where he was being held without bail and awaiting his next court hearing on Sept. 25.\nThe charges against Rittenhouse included first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a life sentence. The Chicago Tribune reported:\nRittenhouse’s case immediately became a popular cause in conservative circles, where pundits began defending the teenager before he had even been charged. At least two defense funds have been launched in his name in recent days, though it’s unclear if the Rittenhouse family supports either of those efforts.\nThat brings us to the question from Snopes readers: Was a website that brands itself as Christian called GiveSendGo hosting an apparent online fundraiser to help Rittenhouse pay court costs?\nFirst, we searched several crowdfunding sites for online campaigns with a similar stated goal: to raise money to help Rittenhouse or his family fight criminal charges against him. None appeared on GoFundMe, as of this report.\nSeveral crowdfunding pages, however, were active and allegedly supporting Rittenhouse’s case on Fundly (see partial search results below). Additionally, a conservative student group at Arizona State University pledged to donate half of its future fundraising dollars to the cause. “[Rittenhouse] does not deserve to have his entire life destroyed because of the actions of violent anarchists during a lawless riot,” the college group tweeted.\n\nNext, we considered crowdfunding platforms that describe themselves as Christian and researched GiveSendGo at readers’ requests. According to the website, which describes itself as the “#1 Free Christian Crowdfunding Site,” users can organize and run crowdsourcing campaigns for free by using personalized logins and donate to GiveSendGo directly. The website’s “About Us” page stated:\nGiveSendGo is meant to give Christians the opportunity to be supported by the body of Christ. A place for the body of Christ to get out from their comfortable pews and support people in God’s family that they might not have ever known about. […] A place for Christians.\nBased on that evidence, it was accurate to claim GiveSendGo describes itself as a website that promotes Christianity.\nThen we looked for proof of pages supporting Rittenhouse on the platform. A keyword search for “Kyle Rittenhouse” uncovered several pages, including a fundraiser titled “Raise Money For Kyle Rittenhouse Legal Defense” that had raised more than $314,000 as of this report.\nIt was the most popular and active GiveSendGo campaign created to supposedly help the teen or his family. The page included the following the description:\nKyle Rittenhouse just defended himself from a brutal attack by multiple members of the far-leftist group ANTIFA – the experience was undoubtedly a brutal one, as he was forced to take two lives to defend his own.\nNow, Kyle is being unfairly charged with murder 1, by a DA who seems determined only to capitalize on the political angle of the situation. The situation was clearly self-defense, and Kyle and his family will undoubtedly need money to pay for the legal fees.\nLet’s give back to someone who bravely tried to defend his community.\nOn Aug. 28, 2020, the page’s organizers — “Friends of the Rittenhouse family” of Atlanta, Georgia — wrote an update to the page in which they claimed they had spoken with Rittenhouse’s mother and legal team and that that party was raising money via multiple methods. The organizers of the GiveSendGo campaign pledged: “All of the money donated … will go to Kyle’s defense, as it is likely to be an expensive and protracted affair.” \nNo specific details on the GiveSendGo page’s organizers were known, including how or under what circumstances they started the alleged fundraiser. Anyone can establish a campaign on the site; donors are encouraged to report pages that appear suspicious or fraudulent, and there was no evidence to confirm or deny the organizers of the campaign for Rittenhouse were indeed giving the payments to help his legal defense, aside from the above-described pledge from them. That update also read:\nKyle is reportedly in good spirits, and I’m told that the incredible support shown by you good people is what’s keeping him going.\n… This young man has reinvigorated the faith of many that this country and its founding principles are indeed founded upon the rock, not built upon the sand.\nHowever, a city upon a hill cannot be hid; Kyle now faces the wrath of those who would see us stripped of our God-given rights and reduced to servitude. He is in dire need of our help.\nThe GiveSendGo page collected more than 7,330 donations as of this report, some of which included messages of support for Rittenhouse. “This young man is a hero. Give him a medal and make him a millionaire. Every patriot can spare him a few bucks” said an anonymous donor who contributed $10, per the page. Another donor said:\n\nBased on those findings — yes, a self-described Christian crowdfunding website GiveSendGo was hosting a campaign to supposedly help Rittenhouse — we reached out to the website’s administrators to learn under what terms it hosts campaigns on its platform. Jacob Wells, a co-founder of the site, told us via email:\nGiveSendGo allows campaigns from all kinds of different people and political/religious ideologies. Just because we are Christians does not mean every campaign on our site has to be one or that we agree with its campaign premise.\n[…] We will withhold judgement and leave that for the courts and God. Our judicial system works on the principle of innocence until proven guilty. As a veteran owned platform we recognize the freedoms we have in the USA came at a very high price and we will not just trample on them to satisfy political correctness.\nAdditionally, he said site administrators were conducting a review of the page involving Rittenhouse to make sure it follows site guidelines, though they “currently believe the campaign is eligible like any other campaigns because it does not violate our terms of service.”\nOn Aug. 27 the crowdfunding site posted the following statement to Twitter:\n\nThe campaign stoked controversy online among people who believed it wrongfully celebrated the actions of an alleged killer and should be removed from the crowdfunding website. Referring to Blake, who was paralyzed from the waist down after a white police officer shot at his back multiple times on Aug. 23, one Facebook user alleged:\n\nIn response to those critics, Wells told Snopes:\nWe recognize that we live in a world of diverse ideas and opinions and that part of our strength is in that diversity. We will respond with grace to those that disagree with us. We will give grace to ourselves to not always get it right as we learn and grown. Finally we will give grace to the campaign owner, those that support the campaign, and Kyle as he walk out [sic] the ramifications of his actions.\nIn sum, given how GiveSendGo describes itself — the “#1 Free Christian Crowdfunding Site” — as well as evidence of listed donations on a webpage that says it will give all contributions to help fund Rittenhouse’s legal defense, we rate this claim “True.”",

The media included in the above-displayed tweets is a few years old, and Sonny Barger, the founder of the Hell’s Angels, has issued a statement refuting this rumor. \nThe top image was taken in 2018 as members of the Hells Angels rode to a national gathering in Quebec, Canada. The brief clip included in the second image comes from a 2011 music video by Lady Gaga:\nSimilar videos purporting to show the Hells Angels “on their way” to Seattle to fight anti-fascist protesters can also be traced back to old and unrelated events.

Stop, It’s untrue and will never happen.”\nMotorcycle clubs are frequently used in online hoaxes attempting to show how right-leaning causes have the support of “tough” individuals. While there truly is a “Bikers for Trump” group that has showed support for the president at various rallies and events, the support and influence of these motorcycle groups has been wildly exaggerated in social media posts.\nFor instance, 100,000 bikers did not show up for a rally in 2016 supporting U.S. President Donald Trump, and this video does not show motorcyclists riding to Washington, D.C., in support of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court.

        "evidence": "In the midst of an ongoing public debate about national anthem protests by NFL players that grew to involve even President Donald Trump in September 2017, Internet users were reminded of an infamous 1980s lawsuit involving the now-defunct United States Football League and the NFL in which Trump had played a key role:Trump repeatedly called for the upstart league to go head-to-head with the NFL by switching its playing season to the fall and winter, once saying: “My attitude has always been [that] the spring was a wasteland, and I came into this league on the basis [of], and predicated on the fact, that I thought the league would move to the fall.”On this point, Trump faced opposition from others within the USFL, in particular John Bassett, the influential owner of the Tampa Bay Bandits. Ultimately, Trump’s view won out, and in 1984 the USFL announced that their 1986 season would begin in the fall.Trump later described  himself as the “leading catalyst” for the decision to move to the USFL season to the fall, although in 1987 the USFL’s former director of communications, Jim Byrne, presented an account of the spring/fall schism within the league that emphasized the role of Harry Usher, who had become USFL commissioner in 1985.However, the planned change in seasons did not work out so well in practice, as the USFL faced severe difficulties in obtaining contracts with major television networks (a key source of revenue), among other problems, which brings us to the lawsuit now so frequently connected with Donald Trump.The source provided for the meme displayed above was a 25 September 2017  article that extensively quoted business journalist Joe Nocera, who offered his recollections about the USFL’s scheduling problems and their response to them:According to a 30 July 1986 report from the , the jury ruled that the NFL had violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by retaining a monopoly power “to control prices or exclude competition” in the country’s professional football market. But jurors awarded such low damages because Judge Peter Leisure had told them they should do so if they were not able to say definitively that the losses suffered by the USFL were caused by the NFL’s control of the market, as opposed to the USFL’s own poor management.Trump hailed the verdict as a “great moral victory,” and the USFL launched a series of motions and appeals that culminated in 1990. But on the playing field, the 1986 USFL was postponed just days after the trial concluded, and the USFL never staged another game.Donald Trump was not a plaintiff in the USFL lawsuit in a personal capacity, but the team he owned, the New Jersey Generals, was one of the plaintiffs.  Moreover, Trump’s long-time personal lawyer, Roy Cohn, was one of the attorneys for the USFL, and both Trump and Cohn gave press conferences and interviews about the case, criticizing the NFL and supporting the USFL’s arguments. And Trump himself testified during the trial.So while Donald Trump may not have been a plaintiff in the ultimately disastrous lawsuit against the NFL, a team he owned was, and it would be entirely reasonable to say he was a driving force behind the litigation.The final component of the meme, that the NFL levied a “lifetime ban” against Donald Trump for his role in the USFL lawsuit, is difficult to rate.  Presumably it refers to Trump’s efforts to obtain an NFL franchise, something then-commissioner Pete Rozelle stated he would never allow, according to Leslie Schupak, senior managing partner at KCSA Worldwide, the USFL’s marketing and public relations firm:So, this aspect boils down to a second-hand account (which was contradicted by one of the participants) of former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle’s supposedly telling Trump in private that he would never allow Trump to own an NFL franchise.  However, any such personal feelings that Rozelle (who died in 1996) may have held along those lines is not codified or enforceable as an NFL rule today.  Moreover, Rozelle reportedly formed his opinion of Trump’s undesirability as an owner back in 1984, two years prior to the USFL’s filing their anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL, so that litigation could not have been the motivation behind Rozelle’s purported “lifetime ban” of Trump from the NFL.On the whole, there are elements of this meme that are accurate: the existence of the lawsuit, the amount of damages, the involvement of Donald Trump. But the meme also fails to make it clear that Trump did not sue the NFL in a personal capacity, and the claim about the NFL’s giving the future president a “lifetime ban” is questionable.",

        "evidence": "On 27 August 2017, as the full damage to Texas from a storm of historic proportions was not yet fully known, a number of social media posts began to spread, alerting readers to a change in Texas law around insurance claims in the event of weather damage. One Facebook user posted the following:Former Texas state representative Glen Maxey wrote:And on 29 August, Rep. Joaquín Castro encouraged Texans affected by Tropical Storm Harvey to file their claims before 1 September:Texas House Bill 1774 does indeed introduce changes to the way property damage insurance claims are dealt with in the state, but only in the event of a litigated dispute over a claim. Most insurance claims are settled out of court, and so the potential benefit in filing a claim before 1 September 2017 (which is itself marginal) will likely not apply in most cases.The real benefit would be in filing a  before 1 September, but for obvious practical reasons, it is extremely unlikely that someone whose home has been destroyed or extensively damaged days earlier, would be in a position to do this. The law was signed by Governor Greg Abbott on 26 May 2017.The first major provision in the law is that an individual or business filing a lawsuit in relation to a weather-related property damage insurance claim (including flood damage) will have to give their insurance company 61 days’ notice before initiating litigation.According to an analysis published by the independent House Research Organization in the Texas House of Representatives:The second major provision in HB 1774 is that it imposes a claim recovery threshold in order for individuals to recover the full amount of their attorney’s fees, if they decide to go to court. If, in the event of a lawsuit, a jury decides to award a plaintiff 80 percent or more of the amount they are claiming, then all that individual’s attorney’s fees will be covered. If a jury decides to award 20 percent or less, none of their attorney’s fees are covered:We consulted two experts on insurance: Etti Baranoff, an associate professor of finance at Virginia Commonwealth University and a former regulator at the Texas Department of Insurance, and Dalit Baranoff, a historian of insurance policy who runs the Risks and Consequences blog. They told us the bill is designed to discourage consumers from taking a claim to court and filing exaggerated claims, but otherwise doesn’t change the process of settling claims out of court. This is where the 61-day waiting period comes into play, which the Baranoffs say is “meant to encourage mediation and out-of-court settlement”, and the 80/20 rule in the new law will make it harder for people to recoup their legal costs if they decide to sue. The reasoning behind this, according to the Baranoffs, is to discourage inflated or exaggerated claims, since claimants will be less likely to be awarded 80 percent or more of a relatively large claim and are therefore more likely to have to pay some attorney’s fees if they do. Indeed, the stated purpose of HB 1774 was to stop a historic increase in the number of hailstorm-related property damage insurance claims, something the bill’s sponsor State Representative Greg Bonnen called “the worst lawsuit abuse we have in the state” (Relevant portion begins at 3:50).Tanya Pierce, Associate Professor of Law at Texas A&M University, previously practiced in the area of complex litigation and insurance coverage. She told us there is only one potential benefit to homeowners in filing a written claim before 1 September 2017:Again, however, this benefit only accrues if the homeowner later decides to sue the insurance company.Under current law, Pierce says, an insurance company would have to pay 18 percent interest on whatever they owed in the event that a consumer successfully sues them for a delayed payment. Under the new law, she points out, companies would have to pay a  rate of interest arrived at by adding 5 percent to the interest rate determined under Sec. 304.003, Financial Code (Sec. 2c). So there is a potential benefit in filing a claim before 1 September 2017, but only if you then later file a successful lawsuit in the event of a dispute over your payment. The new law will not have a direct effect on insurance claims that are settled out of court, and most insurance claims are settled out of court. However, the law could make it slower and more difficult for homeowners to get paid what they believe they are owed if they start litigation after 1 September 2017. It will also make suing insurance companies more financially risky.If a consumer were to file a lawsuit against their insurance company before 1 September, they could experience a significant benefit from having done so. However, if their home has been extensively damaged just before 1 September 2017 (by historically catastrophic flooding, for example), it is extremely unlikely they would be able, practically speaking, to find and hire an attorney and file a suit before 1 September. They would also have to have a reasonable basis to sue — a dispute over their claim, or an insurance company’s refusal to pay, for example — a process that there simply wasn’t time for between the arrival of Tropical Storm Harvey on 26 August and the enactment of the new law on 1 September.The only potential benefit from filing a claim before 1 September is that if someone later decides to sue the insurance company and wins, the company will be obliged to pay them the higher, pre-September rate of interest on what they owe. The claims contained in viral Facebook posts on 27 August 2017 are a largely accurate description of the provisions of HB 1774, but they do lack important context and do not make it clear to readers that the law only affects how claims are dealt with in the event that someone decides to sue an insurance company. These posts do not include that most insurance claims are settled out of court, and will therefore not be directly affected by the change in the law. ",

        "evidence": "On July 16, 2020, as the U.S. recorded its single highest number of COVID-19 cases since the coronavirus health crisis began, U.S. President Donald Trump spoke at an event held on the South Lawn of the White House, ostensibly on the subject of “Rolling Back Regulations to Help All Americans.” During his talk, according to a meme, Trump allegedly tackled the subject of energy-efficiency standards which have supposedly resulted in home appliances that do not function properly due to requirements aimed at conserving the amount of water and power they consume:\n\nThis was an accurate reproduction of a portion of Trump’s talk, according to a White House transcript of the event:\nWe’re bringing back consumer choice in home appliances so that you can buy washers and dryers, showerheads and faucets. So showerheads — you take a shower, the water doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair — I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect.\nDishwashers — you didn’t have any water, so you — the people that do the dishes — you press it, and it goes again, and you do it again and again. So you might as well give them the water because you’ll end up using less water. So we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water. And in many places — in most places of the country, water is not a problem. They don’t know what to do with it. It’s called “rain.” They don’t have a problem.\nThis was far from the first time the president had riffed on poorly functioning appliances. In December 2019, as Trump spoke in the Roosevelt Room of the White House amidst an impeachment inquiry, he digressed into railing about toilets and other bathroom fixtures that allegedly frustrate their users due to the use of low-flow technology. CNN reported:\nThe President claimed Americans are flushing their toilets “10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once” and argued that they are having difficulty with washing their hands in what appeared to be a tangent about low-flow sinks and toilets.\n“We have a situation where we’re looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on — and in areas where there’s tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don’t get any water,” the President said during a roundtable with small business leaders about deregulatory actions.\n“You turn on the faucet and you don’t get any water. They take a shower and water comes dripping out. Just dripping out, very quietly dripping out,” the President continued, lowering his voice as he spoke about the drips. “People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once.”\nIt wasn’t entirely clear what he was talking about, but it appeared to have to do with bathroom fixtures with low-flow appliances. He said the Environmental Protection Agency was looking into the issue on his suggestion.\n“They end up using more water. So (the) EPA is looking at that very strongly at my suggestion,” Trump said, though he did not give details on what suggestions, if any, he made.\nNPR quoted the Pacific Institute, a non-profit research institute with a focus on global and regional freshwater issues, as asserting that Trump’s statements did not comport with reality:\nPeter Gleick with the Pacific Institute in Oakland considers this all to be Trumpian nostalgia for a time when showers were strong, toilets used 4 gallons a flush and lightbulbs burned your hands when you touched them.\nGleick said these newer household items are part of an “efficiency revolution,” doing the same tasks with less and halting the upward trajectory of water and energy consumption in America. And, yes, a dishwasher cycle takes longer, and incandescent bulbs are cheaper to buy upfront.\nBut in the long run, “They’re much more expensive, because they use a huge amount of energy, which we pay for over time and they burn out 20 times faster,” Gleick said.\nBased on the way Trump talks about efficient lightbulbs, it seems his complaint is with compact fluorescent bulbs, which were the only low-energy bulbs widely available 10 years ago. But today, store shelves are full of LED bulbs with warmer-looking light and even longer life spans. Gleick suspects Trump’s toilet complaints are outdated as well, because low-flow toilet technology has come a long way in recent years.\n“Some people got bad toilets, but that was 15 and 20 years ago,” Gleick said. “And now the new toilets not only use a tiny fraction of the water the old toilets used to use, but the truth is they flush better — and if you have a bad toilet that doesn’t flush, well, that’s because you have a bad toilet.”\nA video of the portion of the speech reproduced in the above meme can be viewed here:\nTrump: So shower heads, you take a shower, the water doesn’t come out.

        "evidence": "A photograph supposedly showing the Earth from the surface of the moon is frequently shared on social media. In July 2019, for instance, the Facebook page Beautiful World shared the picture with the caption: “A view of Earth from The Moon taken by NASA.”\nThis is not a genuine photograph of Earth from the moon but rather a digital composite of at least two different images. \nThe image is available via stock photography websites such as Shutterstock, where it is presented with the caption: “Blue earth seen from the moon surface: Elements of this image are furnished by NASA.” The image is credited to digital illustrator Romolo Tavani.\nWhile we have been unable to find the original images used to create the above-displayed composite, we did find some genuine photographs that show Earth from the vantage point of the moon. The following photograph was taken on July 21, 1969, by astronaut Michael Collins during the Apollo 11 mission:\nExplanation: After the most famous voyage of modern times, it was time to go home. After proving that humanity has the ability to go beyond the confines of planet Earth, the first humans to walk on another world — Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin — flew the ascent stage of their Lunar Module back to meet Michael Collins in the moon-orbiting Command and Service Module. Pictured above on 1969 July 21, the ascending spaceship was captured by Collins making its approach, with the Moon below, and Earth far in the distance. Tomorrow marks the 40th anniversary of the first human moon landing. Recently, NASA’s moon-orbiting Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter sent back the first pictures of most of the Apollo landing sites — including Apollo 11 — with enough resolution to see the Lunar Module descent stages left behind.\nA few years later, the Apollo 17 crew captured a few more photographs of the Earth from the surface of the moon. The following picture was taken on December 12, 1972, by astronaut Eugene Cernan and shows Harrison Schmitt and an American flag on the surface of the moon with the Earth in the background:\nScientist-astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt stands by the American flag during a moonwalk on the Apollo 17 mission. Home, that small dot in the blackness of space above the flag, is a quarter-million miles away.\nAn article from Universe Today provided more information about how you could expect the Earth to look if you ever found yourself standing on the moon’s surface. For instance, the Earth would go through phases, similar to the moon, meaning that you’d see a “full Earth” on some nights and a partially darkened Earth on others. \nThe Moon is tidally locked to us, and it presents only one face to the Earth.\nIf you were on the near side of the Moon, the Earth would always be in the sky. And if you were on the far side, you’d never see it …\nIf you were standing on the Moon, looking up, you’d see the Earth, hanging in the sky forever, or for however long your robot body holds out.\nIt would go through phases, like the Moon, moving from total darkness, though quarter illumination, Full Earth, and back again. But the features on the Earth would be changing. The face of the Earth would be illuminated, and you’d see the entire planet turning throughout the day and you could use it to cheat on Geography tests.\nIt wouldn’t be totally dark on the night side because “humans”. You’d see those beautiful blobs of stringy light on the shadowed parts of the Earth.\nOur Moon follows an elliptical path around the Earth, getting as close as 363,000 km and as far as 405,000 km.\nThis means the Earth would get bigger and smaller in the sky. As Earth is much larger than the Moon, it would take up 13 times as much area.\n",

        "evidence": "In the summer of 2018, President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy was met with widespread criticism, prompting the Trump administration to scale back elements of the plan (which saw thousands of children separated from their parents at the southwestern border) after less than three months.However, the opposition to that policy prompted allegations of hypocrisy leveled by supporters of President Trump against his predecessor, Barack Obama. Some of those comparisons were inaccurate and misleading, as we have examined here previously.Commentators and social media users brought up an old statement made by Barack Obama back when he was a U.S. Senator representing Illinois, in which he expressed opposition to “undetected, undocumented, unchecked” immigration. The highlighting of that statement was intended to create an equivalence between the views expressed by Barack Obama in 2005 and the “zero tolerance” policy enacted by his successor in the White House in 2018, and (either explicitly or implicitly) level the charge of partisan opportunism and hypocrisy against liberal opponents of Trump’s policies.On 23 June, Fox News contributor Gary Kaltbaum appeared on  and read out the statement in question:On 18 June 2018, the quote was posted on the popular pro-Trump Reddit forum /The_Donald, and on 23 July, Val DiGiorgio (chairman of the Chester County, Pennsylvania Republican party) posted a meme showing a photograph of Obama along with the same quote that Kaltbaum read out on Fox News:Obama did indeed speak these words in 2005, and also said something very similar in 2006, although his expressed opposition to unchecked illegal immigration in 2005 was not the same as support for the “zero tolerance” immigration policy implemented by the Trump administration in 2018.On 15 December 2005, Barack Obama joined Republican Senator Mel Martinez of Florida in a press conference about bipartisan efforts to bring about immigration reform, during which the former stated:Obama then laid out the three basic principles of his preferred approach to immigration reform: enhanced border security and enforcement, a guest worker program and electronic verification capabilities for employers, and an “interim legal status” for the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States whereby those who entered the country illegally would pay a “hefty fine” and “go to the back of the line” before applying for U.S. citizenship.The future president repeatedly criticized any approach to immigration reform that focused only on enforcement measures. Immediately after uttering the words that would be recirculated in 2018, Senator Obama continued on to say:On 3 April 2006, Senator Obama spoke from the floor of the Senate on the subject of immigration reform. In the time-honored tradition of politicians everywhere, the senator re-used many of the phrases and arguments he had deployed a few months earlier:However, Obama again emphasized that enhancing enforcement alone would not, in his opinion, be an effective way to reform the U.S. immigration system. He also again underscored his support for a three-pronged approach: better border security and enforcement, a guest worker program with enhanced protections for the rights of immigrant workers and a system for employers to check the legal status of would-be employees, and a conditional path to citizenship for immigrants who had entered the country illegally.(A full transcript of Obama’s 2006 remarks is available here, on page 24.)In 2005, Obama did say: “We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States, undetected, undocumented, unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country.” And he said something very similar a few months later, in 2006.However, in doing so he was merely articulating an orthodox, relatively uncontroversial position among most American politicians: that the U.S. ought not to have open, unmonitored borders, and immigrants who applied for a visa to live and work in the U.S. should be treated preferentially to those who simply crossed the border without legal status.At no time during the 2005 or 2006 speeches in question did Obama advocate the equivalent of a “zero tolerance” policy of processing even first-time “improper” border crossings via criminal trials, a prosecutorial shift which has necessitated the mass separation of children from parents at the southwestern border (a system we have written about in greater detail elsewhere).During his tenure as president, Barack Obama did oversee the criminal prosecution of some illegal border crossers (as opposed to the traditional approach of administrative removal), under a program known as Operation Streamline begun in 2005 during the administration of President George W. Bush. However, this approach was still largely limited to repeat offenders or those with criminal records, and first-time “improper” entrants into the United States typically continued to be processed administratively before being deported.Crucially, the “zero tolerance” policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April 2018 prescribed the criminal prosecution of  individuals crossing the border unlawfully, even for the first time — a distinctive characteristic of the Trump policy, and the one that brought about the separation of thousands of families at the border, during the spring and summer of 2018.President Obama also oversaw an increase in the rate of deportations during his tenure as president, something that brought about the separation of some immigrant families already residing in the United States. But those families were not typically separated at the border, and this increase in deportations was partly attributable to a change in definitions used in compiling immigration statistics.",

        "evidence": "In February 2020, news outlets such as The Intercept, CBS News, and The BBC published articles reporting that Native American burial sites in southern Arizona were at risk of being, or had already been, damaged during construction of a section of the U.S.-Mexico border wall in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. \nThe Intercept, for instance, reported on Feb. 6:\nContractors working for the Trump administration are blowing apart a mountain on protected lands in southern Arizona to make way for the president’s border wall. The blasting is happening on the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a tract of Sonoran Desert wilderness long celebrated as one of the nation’s great ecological treasures, that holds profound spiritual significance to multiple Native American groups.\nThese reports originated with credible news outlets, yet some readers found the news hard to believe. We received several queries asking if the reports were true. While we recommend reading the articles published by The Intercept, CBS News, and The BBC, we’ll respond to readers’ most pressing questions below. \nIs There a Native American Burial Site on Monument Hill?\nIn early February 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) started construction on a segment of border wall inside Arizona’s Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. CBP officials confirmed that “controlled blasting” had started in an area within the Roosevelt Reservation at Monument Mountain, which is also known as Monument Hill.\nThe Intercept reported:\n“In a statement to The Intercept, U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that the blasting began this week and will continue through the end of the month. “The construction contractor has begun controlled blasting, in preparation for new border wall system construction, within the Roosevelt Reservation at Monument Mountain in the U.S. Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector,” the statement said, referring to an area also known as Monument Hill. “The controlled blasting is targeted and will continue intermittently for the rest of the month.”\nOrgan Pipe Cactus National Monument is located in southern Arizona and sits just above the border of the United States and Mexico. To the east of this national park is the Tohono O’odham Indian Reservation. According to tribe leaders, as well as archaeologists, Monument Hill is home to a Native American burial site. \nIn January 2020, Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva surveyed the area with Ned Norris Jr., the chairman of the Tohono O’odham Nation, Peter Steer, the tribe’s historic preservation officer, and a group of archaeologists. Here’s how Monument Hill was described in a set of briefing notes compiled by Grijalva’s staff after the visit:\nArchaeologists noted that Tribal elders were interviewed and identified this hill as sacred to the O’odham. This hill is first documented and mentioned in Father Kino’s letters when there was no Sonoita. During Apache raids, if a body was found after battle the tribe would place the bodies on this hill. Meaning there are bodies of other tribes in Arizona among this Hill with bone fragments. DHS mentioned that they would back off on developing the Hill, but the work is still being done (as you can see the road is widened in the photos/video) even after the tribe mentioned the cultural and historic significance of this area in a letter. Archeologist Edward Abbey also mentioned Monument Hill and its significance to the tribe in his archeology papers published in 1960s.\nSteer provided similar information to AZ Central. According to Steer, Monument Hill was once used for religious ceremonies and was also the resting place of fallen soldiers. Steer said that bone fragments had also been found on the hill and that the tribe has been able to date back mentions of the hill to the 1600s.\nAZ Central reported:\n“This hill, from the information we’ve been able to gather, was used by Hia-C’ed O’odham for religious ceremonies,” Peter Steere said. “This is also a place, when the Apache were raiding out here, if the Apache warrior was killed, his body was placed on this hill.”\nHe added that the tribe is able to track mentions of the hill dating back hundreds of years. They have found possible references in letters written by Father Eusebio Kino, the famed Jesuit missionary that proselytized the area in the late 1600s.\nThe tribe has documented information about the hill from O’odham elders, as well as archaeologists who have worked in the area.\n“We have found a couple of places with bone fragments up here,” Steere said.\nWhen Rep. Grijalva visited the area in January 2020, construction had not yet started. The Arizona congressman sent a letter to acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf expressing concern over the border wall’s potential impact on the national monument and asked the government to address certain issues, such as the location and schedule for construction and the protection of groundwater resources. Grijalva said that he never received a response to his letter and in February 2020 construction crews began “controlled blasting” in the area. \nGrijalva told The Intercept: “It’s been really frustrating. […] You would think that in a situation like this, that involves human remains, burial sites, bone fragments that are traced and dated a thousand years or more back, that there would be some sensitivity, for lack of a better word, on the part of DHS and the administration. There is none.”\nOn Feb. 9, 2020, Grijalva posted an update on social media stating that two of the four burial sites that he visited had already been disturbed by the construction of the border wall:\nI just got back from the border. \nThis week, Trump blew up a sacred Native American hill on public land to build his racist wall. \nWatch my new update and join the growing movement to stop the wall. #NoBorderWall pic.twitter.com/YgmS94vAwO\n— Raul M. Grijalva (@RepRaulGrijalva) February 9, 2020\n\nAren’t Native American Burial Sites Protected?\nThe U.S. does have laws such as the Environmental Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Native American Graves Protection Act. However, these laws can be circumvented if the government deems that they are at odd with national security.\nCBS News reports that the 2005 REAL ID Act gives the government “broad power to waive” laws that stand in the way of national security:\nThe Trump administration has been able to legally construct the border wall over public land due in large part to a little known law passed in the wake of the 9/11.\nThe REAL ID Act of 2005 gives the federal government broad power to waive other laws that stand in the way of national security. Under REAL ID, the Trump administration has waived dozens of laws — including the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Environmental Protection Act — in its bid to construct the border wall.\n“Of the 21 times the (REAL ID) waiver has been enacted since 2005, 16 of those instances have occurred in the last two and a half years,” reads the letter Grijalva sent to Homeland Security.\nWhat Has CBP Done to Minimize the Impact of the Border Wall in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument?\nCBP does have an “environmental monitor” present during construction; an agency official also said that crews identify the “best construction management practices to minimize impacts on the environment to the greatest extent possible.”\nWe reached out to CBP for more information about their efforts to minimize the environmental impact of the border wall and will update this article when more information becomes available. \nGrijalva was skeptical that these environmental monitors would do anything to prevent further damage to these sacred sites. \nGrijalva told The Intercept that he had zero faith that the Department of Homeland Security’s “environmental monitor will do anything to avoid, mitigate, or even point out some of the sacrilegious things that are occurring and will continue to occur, given the way they’re proceeding.”\nAre Other Native American Burial or Archaeological Sites at Risk?\nGrijalva was not the first to raise concerns about the border wall’s impact on the area. A 123-page internal report from the park service obtained by The Washington Post via a Freedom of Information Act request warned that the border wall’s construction could damage 22 archaeological sites at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument:\nBulldozers and excavators rushing to install President Trump’s border barrier could damage or destroy up to 22 archaeological sites within Arizona’s Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in coming months, according to an internal National Park Service report obtained by The Washington Post.\nThe administration’s plan to convert an existing five-foot-high vehicle barrier into a 30-foot steel edifice could pose irreparable harm to unexcavated remnants of ancient Sonoran Desert peoples. Experts identified these risks as U.S. Customs and Border Protection seeks to fast-track the construction to meet Trump’s campaign pledge of completing 500 miles of barrier by next year’s election.",

        "evidence": "During the coronavirus pandemic of spring 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York remained at the top of the news cycle for two reasons: His state saw by far the largest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and his daily press briefings were a staple of television news coverage of the crisis. The New York governor was also praised as a model of political leadership during an emergency by those who were highly critical of President Donald Trump and his handling of the U.S. federal response to COVID-19.\nDuring that period, a meme circulated via social media stating that Cuomo had recently requested and been granted a $71,000 pay raise that made him the highest-paid governor in the U.S., and that this activity had taken place “while most NYers were sleeping”:\n\nIt was true that Cuomo had been granted a pay raise that would make him (at least temporarily) the highest-paid governor of any state. But that pay adjustment had been recommended and enacted a year earlier (i.e., in 2019, not 2020), the $71,000 increase was phased in across the span of three years (rather than given all at once), and the matter involved multiple recommendations and approvals from state authorities (largely given because the governor’s salary not increased since 1999) which were openly publicized and not hidden from New York residents.\nOn April 1, 2019, both houses of the New York Legislature (Assembly and Senate) approved a pay hike that would increase Cuomo’s compensation from $179,500 to $200,000 in 2019, $225,000 in 2020, and $250,000 in 2021. In terms of base salary, that raise created the potential for Cuomo to become the nation’s highest-paid governor in 2020, out-earning Gov. Gavin Newsom of California (assuming that no other state raised its chief executive’s pay to a higher level before then).\nThe gubernatorial pay hike was one of several salary increases that had been recommended back in December 2018 by the New York State Compensation Committee, which “after months of research and public hearings,” advocated substantial pay raises for multiple high-level state officers — many of whom would, like the governor, would see phased pay increases eventually garnering them well over $200,000 per year:\nA four-member committee has recommended substantial pay raises for members of the state Legislature, the governor, lieutenant governor, state comptroller and state attorney general.\nThe New York State Compensation Committee — consisting of current and former New York state and New York City comptrollers — unveiled their recommendations Monday, December 10, 2018, after months of research and public hearings.\nThe Compensation Committee recommends that, starting on Jan. 1 of 2019, state legislators will receive an annual salary of $110,000.\nBeginning on Jan. 1, 2020, lawmakers will receive an annual salary of $120,000 and their outside income would be capped at $18,000, which 15 percent of their legislative pay.\nBeginning on Jan. 1, 2021, lawmakers would receive $130,000 a year and their outside income would be capped at $19,500, which is 15 percent of their legislative pay. This would be the long-term compensation for state legislators moving forward.\nThe Compensation Committee is also recommending pay increases for the governor, who would receive an annual salary of $250,000 after a three-year phase-in; the lieutenant governor, who would receive $220,000 after a three-year phase-in; and an annual salary of $220,000 for both the state comptroller and state attorney general after a phase-in period.\nExecutive branch commissioners and department heads would also receive pay raises under the plan, with Tier A commissioners making $220,000 after a three-year phase-in.\nAs the New York Post reported, some legislators “grumbled that the [pay raise] measure was thrown in at the last minute” while they were working overtime to pass a state budget, but Cuomo and others defended it by noting that the compensation committee’s recommendations had been published and accepted months earlier:\nBecause the governor can’t sign off on his own pay hike, the raise required legislative action.\nThe state Senate approved the increase at 2:45 a.m. and the Assembly acted a few hours later.\nSome lawmakers grumbled that the measure was thrown in at the last minute, while they were grappling with the new $175.5 billion state budget.\n“The salary adjustments were done last December by the pay commission which publicized and put out a report, which was accepted by the legislature,” Cuomo said. “That was published and discussed in December, so there’s nothing new on that.”\nAssembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) backed up Cuomo.\n“It has a fiscal component to it, so there’s always the realization to do it,” Heastie told reporters. “We felt that all the statewide officials were able to get raises … the governor and the lieutenant governor’s salaries aren’t fixed by statute, they have to be done by a concurrent resolution between the Assembly and the Senate and that’s the reason why they were done.”",

        "evidence": "In August 2020, as states and school districts in the United States grappled with whether and how to reopen schools for the fall semester, multiple readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of a social media post, shared widely by users in the United States, that claimed children who showed symptoms of COVID-19 could lawfully be quarantined outside their family home without the consent of their parents or guardians. \nThe post, which typically began “For all the caring parents out there” and often warned “THEY WILL BE REMOVING YOUR KIDS & YOU CANT [sic] DO OR SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT!” consisted of an imagined conversation between a school teacher and a parent, as follows:\nTeacher: Sorry we have had to take your child to a testing centre [sic] as they were showing symptoms of corona (that means they could have a cold, temperature, a cough)\nParent: Right so where is my child?\nHT [Head teacher]: I’m sorry I can’t disclose that information\nP [Parent]: Is my child ok?\nHT: I can assure you your child is in safe hands, in the mean time you need to self-isolate with your family for 14 days\nP: No I’m coming to get my child now\nHT: I’m sorry but if you arrive at the school we will have no choice but to call the police and have you removed from the premises.\nP: is this a joke? that is my child\nHT: I’m sorry but under the new covid act we have the power to remove your child without your consent if we feel the have symptoms.\nP: So when will I see my child next\nHT: We will have a child service officer contact you.\nNow imagine this was a call from your Childs Headteacher\nI suggest every parent on my facebook gets off there [sic] ass and do some real research on the legislation of the covid act 2020 regarding the laws for children in school!!!!\n\nVersions of the post were originally shared by users in the United Kingdom earlier in August. Clues that the post originated outside the United States could be found in the use of the term “head teacher” (the British equivalent of an American school principal) and in the British spelling of “testing centre.” The post also referred to a piece of legislation called the “COVID Act,” claiming that the law authorized school authorities to “remove” children without parental consent if they presented symptoms of COVID-19. \nA “Coronavirus Act” was passed by the U.K. Parliament in 2020, but it did not give school officials the powers claimed in the viral Facebook post. Versions of the post were subsequently shared by users in Canada, and its claims about the “COVID act” were also false in that context.\nThe U.S. Congress passed no law in 2020 called the “Coronavirus Act” or the “COVID Act” or “COVID-19 Act,” so that particular aspect of the post was also false in the U.S. context on the federal level. We also checked the actions of state legislatures around the country. Based on our examination of the National Conference of State Legislatures database of COVID-19-related legislation, no state had enacted any law that conferred on educational authorities the power to quarantine children with symptoms outside their family home without their parents’ or guardians’ consent. \nAs a result, the “COVID Act” Facebook post shared widely by users in the United States in August 2020 was not only based on an earlier set of claims that originated in an entirely different jurisdiction (the U.K.), but it also did not inadvertently refer to a different recently enacted law that authorized school officials to quarantine pupils. The post’s claims were false.\nA law that empowers educational authorities to quarantine children outside their home without their parents’ consent does not exist and is also highly unlikely to be passed in the United States. Several decades of federal court precedents have established that parents and children have a constitutionally protected right not to be separated. In 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit wrote that:\n“Parents and children have a well-elaborated constitutional right to live together without governmental interference […]. That right is an essential liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee that parents and children will not be separated by the state without due process of law except in an emergency.”\nLike all rights, the right of parents and children to live together is not absolute, and can be curtailed, suspended, or outweighed by competing rights or by a broader public interest.\nFor example, while the law recognizes an individual’s fundamental right to move about as they please, there are circumstances in which state and local officials have the authority to temporarily restrict that right. That includes a quarantine or self-isolation order in which an individual who is known or suspected to have contracted a dangerous and contagious illness — like COVID-19 — is legally forced to stay home because of the risk posed to the broader community. State and local authorities can restrict fundamental freedoms in this way on the basis of something called the “state police powers doctrine,” which we have discussed at greater length elsewhere.\nSimilarly, the right of a parent to live with and raise a child is not absolute. A child also has a fundamental right to be free from physical, sexual, and emotional harm, as well as a right to a basic level of nutrition, shelter, and safety. Where those rights come into conflict, such as in cases where a parent neglects or abuses a child, or is proven incapable of providing care, state authorities can and do intervene to protect the rights of the child, and states can, and sometimes do, involuntarily terminate the parental rights of adults.\nHowever, because parental rights are regarded as fundamental, any law or official action that abridges those rights can be subjected by the courts to what is known as “strict scrutiny.” Roughly speaking, this means that an especially high standard of justification is required any time the state seeks to curtail a fundamental right, and the state has the burden of proving that its actions or policies are not unconstitutional.\nCarlton Larson, Martin Luther King, Jr. professor of law at the University of California-Davis, told Snopes the type of law described in the Facebook post shown above would be very unlikely to survive that kind of judicial scrutiny:\nSuch laws would restrict the fundamental right of parents to raise their children […]. To infringe such a right, the government would have to satisfy strict scrutiny, meaning the law must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. Typically, this means if there are less restrictive alternatives available, the government must first use those.  Fighting Covid would clearly be a compelling state interest, but this doesn’t seem narrowly tailored.  Quarantining at home with parents seems just as safe as quarantining in some government-run facility.  So I suspect a court would quickly declare any such law unconstitutional.\nSimilarly, Barbara Bennett Woodhouse, a law professor and director of the Child Rights Project at Emory University, told Snopes that:\nThe U.S. Constitution protects parents from having children removed from parental custody without a showing that the parent is either unfit or poses an imminent danger to the child. The scenario you describe [the conversation presented in the viral Facebook post] is not consistent with any laws, either state or federal, of which I am aware. In the case of a parent suspected of extreme child abuse or endangerment, the authorities might prevent that parent from taking the child home from school, until an investigation and court hearing could establish the facts. In a medical emergency, if a child’s quarantine or hospitalization were deemed necessary, the parent would be involved in any decisions and would have decision-making authority over where and how the child was to be quarantined.",

        "evidence": "In January 2020, readers asked us about the accuracy of reports that authorities in Australia had announced their intention to cull (kill) around 10,000 camels due to the pressure the animals were placing on drinking water supplies. \nFor example, on Jan. 7, the Weird World Facebook page posted a widely shared meme that contained the following text:\n“More than 10,000 camels to be killed because they drink too much water. Feral camels in South Australia are set to be killed in a bid to stop them drinking too much water as droughts and fires ravage the country. More than 10,000 camels will be shot by professional shooters in helicopters starting Wednesday.”\n\nAlso on Jan. 7, the London Evening Standard published a story with a headline similar to that contained in the meme: “Over 10,000 Australian Camels to Be Shot Because They Drink Too Much Water.” The article reported that:\n“Over 10,000 camels will be shot from helicopters to stop them drinking water in drought ravaged South Australia. Professional shooters will move in on Wednesday, after orders from Aboriginal leaders in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands (AYP). The culling, expected to take about five days, follows complaints from locals about animals looking for any available water source, including tanks and taps in properties.”\nSimilar stories, with similar headlines, were published by the Independent, the Daily Mail, and IndiaTimes.com. Those reports, and the Weird World meme, were broadly accurate, though the specific claim that “more than” 10,000 camels would be culled as part of the plan appears to have been contradicted by a local official who said the number would be between 5,000 and 10,000. They also failed to mention that a small number of wild horses would be targeted in the kill, as well.\nThe APY local government authority, in the state of South Australia, announced the cull in a Jan. 6 news release that read, in part “There will be a feral animal kill across the APY lands. Feral animals, but specifically camels, are the primary target … The cull (kill) will occur the week of 8th January, 2020, when the aerial operations will commence (expected to go over five days).”\nIn a supplementary news release published the following day, APY officials explained the reasoning behind the cull:\nThe region’s first major cull of feral animals is in urgent response to threats posed to communities by an increase in the number of feral camels, and some feral horses, due to drought and extreme heat. Thousands of feral camels are emerging from an arid landscape and moving into communities looking for water, while doing significant damage to infrastructure and housing, and creating serious safety hazards. \nTraditional owners, who have been widely consulted about the cull, have reported extremely large groups of camels and other feral animals in and around communities and in specific hot spots across the APY Lands. The APY Executive Board of Management held an urgent meeting on December 11 about the impact of feral animals on communities and pastoral operations, and approved a resolution for an aerial cull of camels and other feral animals across the APY Lands. \n… Richard King, APY’s general manager, said traditional owners recognized the need to manage feral owners, despite a camel cull presenting a spiritual conflict for some indigenous groups, because of serious risks to community safety and damage to important economic, natural and cultural assets. “There is extreme pressure on remote Aboriginal communities in the APY Lands and their pastoral operations as the camels search for water,” Mr. King said. \n“The dire situation is compounded by dry conditions, animal welfare issues, threats to communities, scarce water supplies, health and environmental impacts, the destruction of country, loss of food supplies and endangerment of travellers on the Stuart Highway and across the APY Lands. Given ongoing dry conditions and the large camel congregations threatening all of the main APY communities and infrastructure, immediate camel control is needed.”\nSeparately, APY’s General Manager Richard King told CBS News that the number of camels being targeted in the cull was between 5,000 and 10,000 — a range that somewhat contradicts the claim, repeated in several news articles, that “more than” or “over” 10,000 camels were to be killed. If the number ends up being 10,000, those reports will transpire to be rather accurate. However, according to King, the number could be as low as half of that figure, a detail noted by none of the articles or the meme mentioned above.",

        "evidence": "During the summer of 2019, remarks by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg prompted a wave of reports, mainly by right-leaning and pro-life websites, that the social network founder had “admitted” to having banned pro-life advertising in the lead-up to Ireland’s May 2018 referendum on abortion, and even that he had “bragged” and “boasted” about it. \nThe conservative PJ Media website published an article with the headline “Mark Zuckerberg Brags: We Didn’t Allow Pro-Life Groups to Advertise Before Ireland’s Abortion Vote.” That article cited a tweet posted by pro-life activist Lila Rose, who wrote that Zuckerberg had “blocked pro-life ads ahead of Ireland’s abortion vote”:\nFB CEO @MarkZuckerburg blocked pro-life ads ahead of Ireland’s abortion vote\nFB COO @sherylsandberg donated $2M to Planned Parenthood\nTwitter CEO @Jack banned my & @LiveAction’s pro-life ads, allows @PPFA ads, & says legal protections for preborn babies are “bad for business” pic.twitter.com/ZkrLoY9H2b\n— Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) July 8, 2019\n \nThe pro-life website Life Site News similarly published an article with the headline “Facebook Intentionally Blocked Pro-Life Ads During Irish Abortion Vote, CEO Admits.” The conservative website The Blaze, founded by former Fox News presenter Glenn Beck, also claimed that Zuckerberg had “bragged” that his company “blocked pro-life ads ahead of Ireland’s vote,” reporting that: “Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg boasted last month about his company’s decision not to allow pro-life ads from American groups to run in Ireland ahead of the country’s referendum vote on abortion last year.”\nIrish Central, an Irish diaspora news website based in New York, reported that:\n“Facebook deliberately banned pro-life advertisements from the US during the Irish abortion referendum after the Irish government told them they had no laws on the books either way to cover such foreign advertising. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has admitted his company deliberately blocked pro-life ads from American groups seeking to influence the recent abortion referendum in Ireland.”\nEach of these reports significantly distorted and misrepresented what actually happened, by leaving out two crucial facts. Firstly, that Facebook banned all advertising — both pro-life and pro-choice — that originated from outside Ireland and had to do with the country’s contentious abortion referendum in May 2018. Secondly, that Facebook continued to host both pro-life and pro-choice advertisements in the lead-up to the referendum, provided they originated within Ireland.\nNone of the articles cited above made any mention of these crucial facts, thereby creating the false impression that Facebook had exclusively targeted pro-life advertising on its platform. Facebook did not do that.\nHowever, the wording of Zuckerberg’s remarks in June 2019 could reasonably create the impression that the catalyst for Facebook’s blanket ban on foreign, abortion-related advertising may have been an influx of pro-life ads, many of them created by U.S. actors, on the Facebook feeds of Irish users, in the early days of the referendum campaign. \nOn May 25, 2018, the Irish electorate voted in favor of repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Irish constitution, by a margin of 66.4 percent to 33.6 percent. (Under Ireland’s constitution, any constitutional changes must be ratified by referendum). \nAfter the repeal of the Eighth Amendment, Ireland’s parliament was free to pass its own laws on the availability of abortion services, which it duly did in December 2018, legalizing abortion up to 12 weeks, and after that point in cases where a risk exists to the life of a woman, or a serious risk to her health. \nThe Eighth Amendment had been passed in 1983, enshrining in Ireland’s constitution the “equal right to life” of “the unborn” and “the mother,” and giving constitutional backing to Ireland’s existing and long-standing ban on abortion. However, the inherent tension in the law between the rights to life of the unborn child and its mother created ambiguity and uncertainty in how it should be interpreted, especially in cases where a pregnancy posed a threat to a woman’s life.\nIn 1992, Ireland’s Supreme Court ruled that a threat to the life of a mother, including the risk of suicide, was a legitimate ground for abortion. However, Irish lawmakers did not implement that ruling in legislation until 2013. \nAfter five years of activism and debate, and following lengthy consultations involving a parliamentary committee and a “citizen’s assembly,” in March 2018 the Irish government set the date for a vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment, formally launching the referendum campaign. \nIrish election and referendum campaigns are very short in comparison with campaigns in the United States (the second phase of Ireland’s 2018 presidential election lasted only 30 days, for example). As a result, the period between late March and late May 2018 saw a flurry of intense campaigning and debating on both sides of the abortion-referendum campaign, including targeted social media activism and paid advertising on Facebook and Google (including YouTube). \nUnlike in the U.S. and other countries, political advertising is banned on radio and television in Ireland, and broadcast media are also governed by strict regulations around fairness and balance in hosting political debates, especially once a campaign has been formally opened.\nSocial media, by contrast, is not governed by any law when it comes to political content, and that gap in Irish regulations prompted concerns about a lack of transparency about the identity, affiliations and funding of those who created various referendum-themed social media pages, posts and paid advertisements. In particular, the role of foreign actors became a cause for concern among some transparency activists and political commentators in the lead-up to the May 25 vote. \nAs part of that push for enhanced transparency, on April 25 Facebook expanded its “View Ads” feature (which had been tested in Canada) to Ireland, meaning only authorized advertisers could purchase political and “issue” advertisements. (In order to become authorized to publish political advertisements, individuals must verify their identities and location with Facebook).\nThe expansion of the “View Ads” feature also meant Irish Facebook users who were targeted with an advertisement on a particular page could also see a list of all the other advertisements published by that page, in principle creating further context and transparency around political advertising. \nOn May 8, Facebook went further, announcing it had decided not to accept any further advertisements relating to the Eighth Amendment referendum campaign, if those advertisements were being sought by actors based outside Ireland. In a news release, the company wrote:\n“Facebook will no longer be accepting ads related to the forthcoming referendum if they are from advertisers based outside of Ireland. Concerns have been raised about organisations and individuals based outside of Ireland trying to influence the outcome of the referendum on the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Ireland by buying ads on Facebook. This is an issue we have been thinking about for some time. Today, as part of our efforts to help protect the integrity of elections and referendums from undue influence, we will begin rejecting ads related to the referendum if they are being run by advertisers based outside of Ireland.”\nThe announcement made no reference to the viewpoint of those “individuals based outside of Ireland,” meaning the claim that Facebook targeted or banned pro-life advertisements, in particular, was false. Facebook also continued to allow referendum-related advertisements from authorized advertisers, regardless of their viewpoint on the issue of abortion, but provided Facebook determined they were based inside Ireland. \nThe Transparent Referendum Initiative, a crowdsourcing project overseen by volunteer transparency advocates and technology experts, collated a database of referendum-related advertisements that appeared on the Facebook feeds of Irish users during the campaign. \nThat database contains multiple examples of pro-life paid advertisements being posted to Facebook after the company announced its crackdown on foreign advertising purchases on May 8. This further disproves any claim that Zuckerberg had either admitted, bragged or boasted that Facebook “didn’t allow pro-life groups to advertise” before the referendum. Facebook did allow that, but simply barred actors based outside Ireland — whether pro-life or pro-choice — from doing the same, after May 8.\nFor its part, Google went a step further than Facebook on May 9, banning any and all referendum-related advertising from YouTube and Google AdWords. \nOn June 26, 2019, Zuckerberg appeared at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado and made remarks about how Facebook operates in countries where certain regulations are lacking, particularly around political advertising. The company’s CEO encouraged national governments to pass their own laws regulating political content and advertising, rather than relying on large technology companies such as Facebook to intervene in the interests of transparency. He offered the Eighth Amendment referendum campaign in Ireland as an example:\nThere are other types of laws around the world that I think would be positive as well. For example, we had an issue — this is not an American example — but we had an issue in Ireland. In the last year there was a referendum on abortion, and during that election [sic], leading up to that referendum, a bunch of pro-life American groups advertised, leading up to this Irish election [sic], to try to influence public opinion there.\nAnd we went to the Irish and asked folks there, ‘Well, how do you want us to handle this? You have no laws on the books that are relevant for whether we should be allowing this kind of speech in your election, and really this doesn’t feel like the kind of thing that a private company should be making a decision on.’ And their response at the time was, ‘We don’t currently have a law, so you need to make whatever decision you want to make.’\nWe ended up not allowing the ads, but at the end of the day, that feels like the kind of thing, around the world in different democracies, that you’d really want the local countries to be deciding for themselves — what kind of discourse they want and what kind of advertising they want in their elections — not a private company. \n  \nThe first thing to note about Zuckerberg’s remarks is that he is clearly not “bragging” or “boasting” about Facebook’s intervention during the abortion referendum in Ireland. In fact, he expressed reticence on the part of Facebook about having a decisive role in regulating political advertising in the country in that case, and he was using the Eighth Amendment campaign as an example of why it would be better, in his view, for individual national governments to use local statutes, rather than private companies, to regulate that kind of content. \nFurthermore, some reports have assumed that in describing consultations between Facebook and “folks” in Ireland, Zuckerberg was saying that Facebook intervened in the Eighth Amendment campaign after conversations with members of the Irish government, which had proposed the repeal of the constitutional ban on abortion. \nIn fact, a spokesperson for Facebook clarified that the company had not had any conversations with members of the Irish government on the issue, but rather consulted with an electoral watchdog called the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO). SIPO is independent of the government of Ireland, and operates on a strictly non-partisan basis. It is responsible for investigating and enforcing laws around political ethics, election spending, donations, and so on. \nSo it is false to claim, as some reports did, that Facebook had consulted with the Irish government who, motivated by a desire to see the Eighth Amendment repealed, persuaded Facebook to intervene by specifically targeting pro-life advertisements. \n(After the publication of this fact check, LifeNews.com edited a report which had claimed Zuckerberg told the Aspen Ideas Festival that Facebook “asked pro-abortion politicians last year whether it should ban pro-life ads” during the campaign. The amended article subsequently stated that Facebook had put that enquiry to “an Irish government agency,” an apparent allusion to SIPO. The article did not include a correction, or an explanation of the source of that detail, since Zuckerberg did not mention any “Irish government agency” in his Aspen remarks). \nRather, in April 2018 Facebook raised concerns with SIPO that it may have discovered evidence of a violation of Ireland’s law against foreign donations to political campaigns, in the form of a U.S.-based actor paying Facebook to “boost” a post that had been created by an Irish-based abortion-campaign page.\nThe case was rather complicated, and involved several inter-connected Facebook pages that shared the same administrators, one of whom was Irish and one of whom was American, and in the end SIPO reached no clear conclusion about whether a breach of the law against foreign campaign donations occurred. In email correspondence released under Ireland’s Freedom of Information law, Facebook representatives were scrupulous in not revealing to SIPO the nature or viewpoint of the campaign pages in question.\nSeparately, a spokesperson for Facebook told us that in the first weeks of the campaign, Facebook had become aware of several concerns about foreign actors attempting to influence the campaign, and that one of those concerns related to U.S.-based, pro-life groups paying for advertising on the platform. That concern, the spokesperson told us, partly informed Facebook’s later decision to implement a blanket ban on all foreign referendum-related advertising, but only because of an overarching concern for the integrity of the election, and not because of the views those U.S. groups happened to hold. \nIt was to this that Zuckerberg was referring in his Aspen remarks, when he said “leading up to that referendum, a bunch of pro-life American groups advertised … to try to influence public opinion there.” The prospect of undue influence from foreign actors, who happened to hold pro-life views, was one of the catalysts for the later blanket ban on foreign advertising, rather than their pro-life stance being its target. ",

        "evidence": "Sitting in front of a mock pharmacy and flanked by people in white lab coats, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders on July 24, 2020, that he framed as end-all solutions for Americans who struggle to pay high premium prices for prescription drugs. Of one of the directives, specifically, Trump told a crowd of supporters and reporters at the ceremony:\nUnder this order, the price of insulin for affected patients will come down to just pennies a day — pennies a day from numbers that you weren’t even able to think about. It’s a massive cost savings.\nNews outlets such as The New York Times and Washington Post described the signing event like it was largely symbolic, since the executive orders are unlikely to take effect this year, if at all (we explain more below).\nMeanwhile, at least two conservative media sources, Ben Shapiro’s Daily Wire and CNSNews — which claims to balance “liberal bias” in mainstream news with its coverage — reported on the president’s pledge to slash prescription prices at face value, and highlighted the above-mentioned quote by Trump regarding insulin.\nCNSNews published the story, “Trump Says Executive Order Will Drop the Price of Insulin Down to Pennies a Day,” which mainly quoted the president verbatim, and numerous Snopes readers reached out to us to investigate the claim’s accuracy. Namely, diabetic patients wondered whether they would indeed pay less for insulin syringes or insulin cartridges for their pens or pumps because of the president.\n\nAccording to a Congressional analysis in September 2019, insulin averaged $34.75 per dose in the U.S. — a total that’s almost 2.5 times higher than the average price in other countries.\nFirst, we’ll lay out what was unequivocally true: Trump issued Executive Order on Access to Affordable Life-saving Medications during the July 24, 2020, signing event, and that directive authorized the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make certain changes regarding the cost of EpiPens for Americans with severe allergies and the cost of insulin for those who suffer from diabetes, specifically. It stated:\nThe price of insulin in the United States has risen dramatically over the past decade. … While Americans with diabetes and severe allergic reactions may have access to affordable insulin and injectable epinephrine through commercial insurance or Federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, many Americans still struggle to purchase these products.\nHere’s some more context: Medicare, the federal program that covers the majority of Americans over age 65 and those with disabilities, offers plans that help diabetic patients cover the cost of some insulin products. Meanwhile, policies for Medicaid, the government-run health insurance system for low-income people, vary state by state — variances that include whether or not the program covers the cost of diabetic enrollees’ insulin, or to what extent.\nTrump’s directive pertained to “federally qualified health centers” (FQHC), which are about 1,400 community health care clinics nationwide that treat low-income patients on sliding fee scales and purchase discounted drugs from pharmaceutical companies under an existing federal program, known as 340B. The July 2020 executive order was worded like this:\n\nIn other words, the president’s order requires participants of the 340B Program to offer insulin at greatly reduced prices to patients with no or little insurance coverage, without providing specifics on how or when the change would take effect. Advisory Board, a news site for health care providers, said in a statement: “Only patients with low incomes; those with high cost-sharing requirements for insulin or epinephrine; those with high, unmet deductibles; and/or those without health insurance would be eligible for the discount.” A news release from the HHS said:\nThis will increase access to life-saving insulin and epinephrine for the patients who face especially high costs among the 28 million patients who visit FQHCs every year, over six million of whom are uninsured.\nFor perspective, about 34.2 million Americans had diabetes as of 2018, which represented about 10.5 percent of the population, according to the American Diabetes Association. So, hypothetically, if the same proportion of people had diabetes within the FQHC population of 28 million patients (a total reported by the HHS), then Trump’s executive order could help about 2.9 million people, depending on whether their insurance already covers the treatment.\nSo to recap, in regard to the claim in question, it was true to state Trump signed an executive order in July 2020 that aimed to make it easier for low-income diabetic patients to pay for insulin.\nBut nowhere in the federal document did the presidential administration explain its plan for implementing the change, nor the level to which insulin prices would drop. There was no proof that the order would allow any American to someday pay “pennies a day” on the protein hormone.\nWe should note here: In addition to that previously explained executive order, a separate directive signed by Trump on July 24, 2020, touched on a yet-to-be-finalized initiative by the White House to relax international drug importation rules and added insulin to a list of prescription medications that can be imported from Canada. The president characterized that directive, too, as a positive step for people who want lower insulin costs.\nAnd that brings us to our final point: Much of what Trump celebrated in the July 2020 executive orders had been proposed by his administration prior to the signing ceremony but stalled amid opposition from pharmaceutical companies and political barriers. “[None] of these ideas put forth are new, or in fact any more implementable than before, especially without congressional action,” an investor told FeircePharma, a trade publication for the pharmaceutical industry.\nFor instance, in May 2020, Trump unveiled a plan to cap the cost of insulin for Medicare recipients at $35 per month beginning in 2021 (even that initiative would cost patients more than “pennies a day”). But as of this writing, it was unclear exactly how that directive would roll out, and when or if qualifying seniors with diabetes would notice a price difference. The Washington Post reported on July 24, 2020:\nThe moves [by Trump] are largely symbolic because the orders are unlikely to take effect anytime soon, if they do so at all, because the power to implement drug pricing policy through executive order is limited. Voters will not see an impact before the November elections, and the drug industry is sure to challenge them in court.\nA couple days after the July signing ceremony, for example, Politico reported that representatives of major drug lobbies refused to meet with the president to discuss one of the four executive orders: a non-specific and controversial proposal to link Medicare payments for certain medicines to lower costs that people pay in other countries. After that refusal on industry leaders’ part, investors told MarketWatch that the executive orders were “largely campaign fodder” and “come without the necessary force to meaningfully change prices in the U.S.” \nIn sum, while it was truthful to claim Trump issued an executive order in July 2020 that was intended to lower the price of insulin for some Americans, it was misleading to claim that all diabetic patients would save money as a result of the directive — the directive only targeted  low-income patients who are uninsured or underinsured and seek help from certain federal community health providers. Additionally, it was unclear as of this report when, if at all, that group would actually reap the benefit of the cost savings, and the estimated amount of such was unknown. It would be wrong to state based on available evidence that the executive order alone would drive down prices to “pennies a day.” For those reasons, we rate this claim a “Mixture” of truth and falsehoods.",

        "evidence": "In June 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the animated children show “Paw Patrol” had been canceled due to its portrayal of puppy police officers: \n\n“Paw Patrol” has not been canceled.\nThis rumor started as social media users debated the impact of how police officers were portrayed on television and in movies in light of widespread protests against police brutality and racial injustice across the country. That led to long-running shows such as “Cops” and “Live PD” getting canceled, and spurred a number of people who worked on TV shows about law enforcement to donate to causes related to the Black Lives Matter movement. \nAs protests nationwide gained momentum, some social media users posted tongue-in-cheek messages calling for the cancellation of the animated children’s show. This led to a think piece published in The New York Times that stated “it was only a matter of time before the protests came for “Paw Patrol.” \nThe excerpt from the Times story:\n“Paw Patrol” is a children’s cartoon about a squad of canine helpers. It is basically a pretense for placing household pets in a variety of cool trucks. The team includes Marshall, a firefighting Dalmatian; Rubble, a bulldog construction worker; and Chase, a German shepherd who is also a cop. In the world of “Paw Patrol,” Chase is drawn to be a very good boy who barks stuff like “Chase is on the case!” and “All in a police pup’s day!” as he rescues kittens in his tricked-out S.U.V.\nBut last week, when the show’s official Twitter account put out a bland call for “Black voices to be heard,” commenters came after Chase. “Euthanize the police dog,” they said. “Defund the paw patrol.” “All dogs go to heaven, except the class traitors in the Paw Patrol.”\nIt’s a joke, but it’s also not. As the protests against racist police violence enter their third week, the charges are mounting against fictional cops, too. Even big-hearted cartoon police dogs — or maybe especially big-hearted cartoon police dogs — are on notice. The effort to publicize police brutality also means banishing the good-cop archetype, which reigns on both television and in viral videos of the protests themselves. “Paw Patrol” seems harmless enough, and that’s the point: The movement rests on understanding that cops do plenty of harm.\nShortly after the Times story was published, conservative figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump’s son Eric and Dana Loesch, sometime spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, said that the “rage mob” was making an effort to cancel the show.\nAs far as we can tell, earnest calls to have “Paw Patrol” canceled due to its portrayal of police officers have been few and far between. While the vast majority of the posts calling for the cancellation of “Paw Patrol” were made in jest, they were prompted by a genuine conversation concerning the impact of how police officers are portrayed in television and movies.\nAn old article from the satirical news publication The Onion may have contributed to some confusion over whether or not “Paw Patrol” got canceled. In 2018, The Onion published an article claiming that a “Paw Patrol” writer was defending an episode in which a German shepherd shot a black Lab 18 times in the back. \nMeanwhile, Nickelodeon, the network that airs “Paw Patrol,” has also released messages in support of the protests. It should also be noted that on June 7, 2020, the show went silent on social media in solidarity, muting its content:\nIn solidarity of #amplifymelanatedvoices we will be muting our content until June 7th to give access for Black voices to be heard so we can continue to listen and further our learning. #amplifyblackvoices pic.twitter.com/NO2KeQjpHM\n— PAW Patrol (@pawpatrol) June 2, 2020\n",

        "evidence": "Freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, is the youngest woman elected to serve and is outspoken about progressive values. She is also the frequent target of smears.\nIn a version of one such smear, launched on Sept. 11, 2019, various websites and social media users twisted comments she had made months prior to make them appear she had suggested the public should no longer see images from the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U.S.\n“Ocasio-Cortez Says we Shouldn’t Show the Public Photos of 9/11 Anymore,” one such headline stated. “AOC says remembering the 9/11 attacks is an incitement of violence against Ilhan Omar and other Progressive women of color,” tweeted one social media user.\nBut that’s not what Ocasio-Cortez said. And though many of these posts were made on the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, she made the relevant comments in April 2019.\nIn her statement, Ocasio-Cortez was blasting yet another bad-faith interpretation of comments made by her fellow freshman congresswoman, Ilhan Omar. The Democrat from Minnesota is one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress and the first to wear a hijab, or a religious head covering, while doing so.\nOmar had given a speech in March 2019 at a banquet hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in which she talked about the rise of Islamophobia and the erosion of the Muslim community’s civil liberties after 9/11, stating that the community as a whole was being punished for the actions of a few.\n“CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,” Omar said. (CAIR was actually founded prior to the attacks.)\nOn April 11, 2019, the New York Post ran a front-page image of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan burning after being hit by jetliners on 9/11. The Post paired that image with a portion of the remark made by Omar, taken out of context, to give the impression that Omar had shown disrespect for that tragedy.\nThis is ugly pic.twitter.com/R2XVyS4dq8\n— Harry Siegel (@harrysiegel) April 11, 2019\n\nIt was that cover of the Post that Ocasio-Cortez was responding to when she made the following comment on April 11, 2019:\nPrinting on the front page to circulate all around New York City an image that is incredibly upsetting and triggering for New Yorkers that were actually there, and were actually in the radius, that woke up one morning or were in their schools and didn’t know if they were going to see their parents at the end of the day — to elicit such an image for such a transparently and politically-motivated attack on Ilhan — this is, we are getting to the level where this is an incitement of violence against progressive women of color. And if they can’t figure out how to get it back to policy, we need to call it out for what it is. Because this is not normal, and this is not a normal level of political debate or rhetoric. As wild as it can get sometimes, this is something beyond what is normal.\nOcasio-Cortez was responding to the cover of the New York Post on April 11, 2019, which was also criticized by others when it was published for being incendiary and displaying anti-Muslim bigotry. She was not stating that the public should not view images from the terrorist attacks. We thus rate this claim “False.”",

But she did say that statues honoring racist historical figures in her home state of Tennessee should be removed.\nIn Twitter and Instagram posts published on June 12, 2020, Swift criticized efforts to reinstate or protect monuments depicting Edward Carmack, a white newspaper editor who wrote pro-lynching editorials, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Klansman and Confederate general.\n“As a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things,” Swift wrote. “Edward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such.”\nSwift’s comments came amid a widespread movement to remove monuments to racist historical figures, which followed nationwide protests against racism and police violence over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man whose death in the custody of Minneapolis police was filmed by a bystander and went viral, sparking outrage.\nBecause Swift did not call for the removal of the Statue of Liberty, which was a gift from France to the United States in the 19th century, but instead called on Tennessee to remove statues of racist figures, we rate this claim “False.”",

Seemingly in response to such regulations, images of cards and flyers citing the Department of Justice (DOJ) began cropping up across the internet, proclaiming certain laws made the bearer exempt from wearing face masks \nThese cards were shared on California-based Facebook groups in June, around the same time the state issued an executive order requiring Californians to wear face masks in public. Snopes readers asked us if the cards were valid. We learned they were not. \nHEADS UP fellow businesses…. This is not a thing.

Wearing a face mask posses [sic] a mental and/or physical risk to me. Under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), I am not required to disclose my condition to you … Denying access to your business/organization will be also reported to FTBA for further actions.\nPresented like a business card, it mislabeled the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as singular “Disability” act, included the ADA information line‘s phone number, and claimed there would be steep fines for any violation.\nIn an announcement on ADA.gov, while not explicitly referencing the above card, the Department of Justice (DOJ) declared such postings or flyers on the internet that used its seal as fraudulent. The San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department, California, reiterated this:\n\nThe Freedom to Breathe Agency (FTBA), according to its Facebook page, was previously known as the Anti-Mask Task Force, and described itself as a “movement of proud American citizens who are dedicated to protecting their freedom and liberty.” They would not be able to enforce any action against offenders because they are not connected to a government agency.\nBut the card’s fake credentials implied that able-bodied bearers could exploit legitimate ADA regulations meant to protect people with disabilities. Snopes fact-checked a similar story in May 2020, when we learned that the ADA requires that businesses with mandatory mask regulations must accommodate individuals who cannot wear masks due to their health or a disability. \nCoinciding with claims made in the card’s text, in many parts of the U.S., people aren’t required to disclose their physical condition if a business asks for proof of disability. But able-bodied people who seek to exploit such protections would not be supported by the ADA if, for example, they tried to sue a business for refusing them entry. In our previous investigation, we reached out to numerous ADA centers across the country. The New England ADA Center, for instance, told us:\nThe ADA protects the privacy of people who have disabilities. People who lie about a medical condition and don’t have one, do not have rights under the ADA.\nIn sum, even though their arguments rely on existing protections for people with disabilities, such cards arguing that bearers can be exempted from wearing masks are totally fake. We thus rate this claim as “Mostly False.”",

        "evidence": "At least one account of generosity stemming from the devastating Camp Fire in California in November 2018 can be verified as true.As the Grass Valley  newspaper and other news outlets reported, the Paradise Adventist Academy girls’ volleyball team arrived to compete in a California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) playoff game on 10 November 2018 to find that their opponents at Forest Lake Christian High School had provided them with both material and financial support.After the game, Forest Lake athletic director LaRon Gordon announced that local parents and students had donated around $16,000 as well as shoes, clothes, and toiletries to their opponents as well as gift cards for each individual player. Gordon’s team also gave Paradise Adventist new jerseys, shorts, and knee pads to use for the contest, which was a semifinal match in the Northern California Division VI regional tournament.Forest Lake also received permission from the CIF to forego charging admission to the game in favor of donating all tickets sales to help victims of the fire.“I’ve never been so overwhelmed by so many things I would have never thought possible, and this is one of the most amazing things I could ever have thought would happen,” Paradise Adventist head coach Jason Eyer said following the announcement. “Your community is awesome. We will be forever grateful.”Gordon’s announcement was also captured in a video posted online:Forest Lake won the game in four sets, though they lost the Division IV regional final to Stone Ridge Christian out of Merced, California, three days later. (We contacted Eyer seeking further comment about his team’s memorable away game but did not receive a response prior to publication.)The fire, which erupted on 8 November 2018, had killed 77 people as of 18 November 2018, with another 1,276 people listed as missing in its aftermath. It consumed nearly the entirety of the town of Paradise, a small community in Butte County in northern California, and forced evacuations in several other cities including: Paradise; Centerville; Yankee Hill; Concow; and Butte Creek Canyon.It was also the cause of another disagreement between President Donald Trump and California Gov. Jerry Brown: while Brown cited the fire as a consequence of climate change, the president blamed what he called poor management for the blaze, eliding the fact that some 60 percent of California state forests are under management by federal agencies.More than 50,000 people were reportedly displaced by the blaze, and air quality across the Bay Area decreased as a result of smoke produced by the fire.

        "evidence": "One of the primary issues that the U.S. federal and state governments were wrestling with during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in May 2020 was the trade-off of keeping social distancing and business closure restrictions in place to protect lives, versus the trade-off of ongoing (and possibly permanent) economic harm to individuals, businesses, and the country as a whole.\nOn May 5, 2020, while U.S. President Donald Trump was in Phoenix, Arizona, to tour a medical face mask manufacturing facility there, he was interviewed by David Muir of ABC News about the subject of reopening the U.S.:\n \nShortly after the interview aired, a meme began to circulate on social media holding that when Trump had been asked during that interview what he’d say to people who lost family members to COVID-19, he replied, “I would say this didn’t hurt anyone as much as it hurt me”:\n\nAlthough this meme is vaguely reflective of something Trump said during that interview, it grossly misrepresents both what he literally said and what he meant.\nAccording to the transcript of that interview, Trump was asked the following by Muir: “We’ve lost more people now [to COVID-19] than we lost in the Vietnam War. What do you want to say to those families tonight?” Trump responded in full as reproduced below:\nI want to say: “I love you.” I want to say that we’re doing everything we can. I also want to say that we’re trying to project people over 60 years old. We’re trying so hard and — everything I’ve said today — I’d like to preface it by saying, if you’re 60 years old and especially if you’re 60 or even less than that and you’ve had a heart condition or you’ve had diabetes or a problem of any kind — it seeks out problems. This is a vicious — it seeks out weakness, in terms of medical —\nIf somebody has any form of a heart problem or diabetes — anything — it seeks it out. It’s a vicious, vicious virus. But I want to just say to the people that have lost family and have lost loved ones, and the people that have just suffered so badly, and just made it — and just made it — that we love you. We’re with you. We’re working with you. We’re supplying vast amounts of money, like never before. We want that money to get to the people, and we want ‘em to get better.\nAnd we want them — you can never really come close to replacing, when you’ve lost some — no matter how well we do next year, I think our economy is going to be raging. It’s going to be so good. No matter how well, those people can never ever replace somebody they love. But we’re going to have something that they’re going to be very proud of. And to the people that have lost someone, there’s nobody — I don’t sleep at night thinking about it. There’s nobody that’s taken it harder than me. But at the same time I have to get this enemy defeated. And that’s what we’re doing, David. That’s what we’re doing.\nAs indicated in the bolded passages above, Trump expressed sympathy for the families who had suffered and lost loved ones to COVID-19, said he “didn’t sleep night at night thinking about it,” and asserted that nobody had taken “it” (i.e., grappling with the effects of the pandemic) harder than himself. He perhaps undercut his message somewhat by mixing in the anguish of losing loved ones to disease (“those people can never ever replace somebody they love”) with talk about recharging the economy (“I think our economy is going to be raging … we’re going to have something that they’re going to be very proud of”), but he did not say anything that could reasonably be interpreted as meaning that coronavirus related deaths “didn’t hurt anyone as much as it hurt me.”",

        "evidence": "A dystopian but fake video showing a sharpshooting robot turning on its human tormenters fooled some people online in late October 2019 — likely because sophisticated artificial intelligence and increasingly agile robots are quickly becoming a reality.\nThe video was created by Corridor Digital and labeled “Bosstown Dynamics.” The original can be found on the company’s YouTube channel. It shows some men at a gun range who appear to be testing out a very human-like robot by arming it with a gun and then hitting it and knocking it down. The robot continues to shoot, until a man orders it to shoot a robot dog. The human robot instead shoots at the man, takes the dog, and runs away.\n\nWhile some on social media complimented the video makers on their skill at creating a realistic-looking computer graphic, others like gun advocate Chris Loesch appeared to be alarmed by it, at least initially (Loesch later noted he knew the video was fake).\nThis is truly astonishing and frightening.

        "evidence": "On 13 July 2018, MGM Resorts International, the entertainment corporation that owns Mandalay Bay Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, filed federal lawsuits in California and Nevada naming over a thousand victims of the 1 October 2017 Route 91 Harvest Festival concert mass shooting as defendants.The lawsuits do not seek compensation from the victims. Instead, MGM argues that litigation should proceed at the federal level because under the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies (SAFETY) Act, the massacre that killed 58 people and wounded roughly 500 was an act of terror. MGM maintains that by the terms of the SAFETY Act, the security firm hired for the concert, Department of Homeland Security-certified Contemporary Services Corporation, is the liable party and not MGM. Court documents note that the shooting victims named in the suit have either filed or have threatened to file lawsuits.Robert Eglet, a Las Vegas attorney representing multiple shooting victims, blasted the lawsuit, saying it has caused survivors to relive the horror of that night. He also said state court in Nevada is the proper venue for litigation because MGM is incorporated there, and that the blame for the massacre lies not with the security firm hired for the concert grounds, but with lapses at the Mandalay Bay hotel where gunman Stephen Paddock fired down on the crowd from a room on the 32nd floor:A representative for MGM described the lawsuits as procedural, with the goal of bringing litigation resulting from the mass shooting into the federal court system and expediting the process for quicker resolution. In a statement, MGM Resorts spokesperson Debra DeShong said of the lawsuit that:Eglet accused MGM of “judge shopping” for a favorable courtroom and said some of the lawsuits that have been filed so far are already in federal court: “To suggest that MGM and Mandalay Bay are doing this in the interest of victims is a big fat lie. They don’t care about victims, they care about keeping their money. They’re trying every dirty trick in the book and they’re trying to intimidate these clients and it’s working on some of them.”On 1 October 2017, Paddock broke his hotel room window and used it as a platform from which to open fire on the crowd of 20,000 people below. In the worst mass shooting in modern history, he killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more. Paddock took his own life when he was surrounded in his hotel suite by law enforcement. Investigators discovered he had amassed 23 firearms in his suite, barricaded the door leading from a stairwell to his room, and set up cameras so he could spot anyone approaching the suite.The massacre resulted in a slew of conspiracy theories and hoaxes about non-existent second shooters and fantastical plots by a secret globalist cabal. To date, the investigation of the shooting has not yielded a clear motive. Federal authorities have not labeled the massacre an act of terror.",

        "evidence": "A smear piece targeting U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff swept a California businessman and engineer into the mix and, in doing so, potentially endangered his child. \nOn Sept. 29, 2019, the right-leaning website The Gateway Pundit posted a story headlined, “EXPLOSIVE REPORT: Rep. Adam Schiff Linked to Prominent Ukrainian Arms Dealer!” The purported “arms dealer” in the story is Igor Pasternak, who is neither a prominent arms dealer nor a Ukrainian.\nSoon after the Gateway Pundit story was published, Fox News primetime host Laura Ingraham boosted the same narrative on her own widely watched program. Both outlets were lashing out in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry spearheaded by Schiff, a Democrat from California who chairs the House Intelligence Committee.\nTrump is accused of using his office to obtain damaging information on a political rival from the Ukrainian government. Thus both The Gateway Pundit and Ingraham attempted to make the case that Schiff had equally inappropriate dealings with Ukraine. But the story is thin, based entirely on the fact that Pasternak, an engineer and business owner, hosted a fundraiser for Schiff in 2013.\nFox News falsely reported that Pasternak “moved his corporation into [Schiff’s] California district” and stated without proof that Schiff “could have” traded political favors for campaign donations. \nPasternak’s company, Worldwide Aeros Corp, is based in Montebello, California, and is not in Schiff’s Congressional district (Pasternak’s district is the 38th, represented by Linda Sanchez). Pasternak, who spoke to us by phone, said neither Fox nor The Gateway Pundit reached out to him for his side of the story.\nThe Gateway Pundit story claims Pasternak “sold arms in places like Syria” and “has also been connected to [billionaire philanthropist] George Soros.” This is a laughable fantasy, Pasternak said.\n“It’s not like stretching of the truth or a misrepresent the facts,” Pasternak told us. “It just has nothing to do with reality.”\nIt’s also not a new narrative. The same story floated in 2018 on a different website, that time in response to a memo authored by Schiff detailing Russian meddling in the 2016 election. \nPasternak did host a fundraiser for Schiff in 2013, but he told us he has donated to multiple politicians, both Democratic and Republican, a statement that can be confirmed by searching his name on the government transparency tool Open Secrets. And he did design some military hardware, including small arms and surveillance equipment, which were used by the Ukrainian military in that country’s conflict with Russian forces.\nBut his company’s main occupation is the manufacture of airships, also known as lighter-than-air aircraft. Furthermore, Pasternak was raised in Ukraine but was born in Kazakhstan. He is also an American citizen. His mother tongue is Russian, he told us. He doesn’t speak Ukrainian.\nPasternak took The Gateway Pundit’s smear against him in stride, joking that the website had publicized “the best picture of me.”\nBut what attracted his concern was that the story included a collage of images, some of which Pasternak believes were taken from his Facebook account. In that collage were not only pictures of his young son but the boy’s name. The story also contained the family’s home address. The information has been posted by various troll accounts on social media, prompting Pasternak to contact authorities.\n“It really to me is not a joke,” Pasternak told us. “If it was just me, then OK, thank you for publicizing my best picture.” But Pasternak, who like Soros is Jewish, read it in a threatening light, noting the collage contained more images of his child than of him. “They clearly understand he’s the most vulnerable point for me.”\nSoros, whose foundation donates money to progressive causes, is the frequent target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\nPasternak said he didn’t make any money off the equipment sent to the Ukrainian military and elected to do so after becoming emotionally moved while visiting Maidan square shortly after deadly clashes with protesters and police in 2014. Pasternak said it’s possible he has been the target of disinformation because his pro-Ukraine activities in the face of Ukraine’s conflict with Russia got him on “Putin’s bad list.”\nSince at least 2014, the Russians have harnessed social media in the U.S. to spread disinformation to influence public opinion, a technique they deployed in their 2016 U.S. election-interference operation.\nWe reached out to Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft, asking why the story on his website included the identity and photograph of an uninvolved child, but received no response. \nAlthough we normally link to stories we fact check, we chose not to do so in this case because the Pundit story identifies a child and contains his picture and address.",

        "evidence": "On 11 October 2018, a Crown Court judge handed down a sentence of life imprisonment to Karen White of West Yorkshire, England, who had pleaded guilty to multiple counts of rape, sexual assault, and unlawful (malicious) wounding.The case was unusual, to say the least. As the  reported, White is a transgender female who committed at least one of the rapes years ago when she still identified as a male. Stranger still, she committed the assaults on female inmates after being transferred from a men’s to a women’s jail due to her declared gender change:White was actually accused of perpetrating four sexual assaults on female prisoners, though she only confessed to two, after previously claiming that she suffered from erectile dysfunction and couldn’t have assaulted anyone at all. A report in the  enumerated White’s offenses:The rapes White confessed to occurred in 2003 and 2016. White (then known as Stephen Wood) was placed under arrest in the first instance, an attack on the pregnant wife of a friend, but the case wasn’t prosecuted at the time for reasons that weren’t divulged in the 2018 trial. The second occurrence came to light when police questioned a woman who had returned a letter White wrote to her from jail. She told them White had violently raped her five or six times over the course of a year.Prior to 2003, White had served jail time for indecent exposure and sexual assaults on children. More recently, according to the , she admitted to probation officers that she was still sexually interested in minors and would “think nothing” of abusing a child.The prosecuting attorneys openly questioned the sincerity of White’s gender change in court. Prosecutor Chris Dunn referred to White as an “alleged” transgender female, pointing out that “there is a smattering of evidence in this case that the defendant’s approach to transition has been less than committed.”Addressing the defendant during sentencing, Judge Christopher Batty said: “You are a predator and highly manipulative and in my view you are a danger. You represent a significant risk of serious harm to children, to women and to the general public.”In any case, White will serve out her sentence in a men’s prison. Although the decision to move her to a women’s jail pending trial was rendered in accordance with a 2017 policy update emphasizing the right of prisoners to be treated “according to the gender in which they identify,” the Prison Service admitted that mistakes were made in White’s case and publicly apologized.Jenny-Anne Bishop, a member of the transgender rights group Transforum, said the local board charged with deciding where prisoners should be incarcerated ought to have taken White’s entire history of criminal offenses into account but didn’t. Moreover, certain procedural steps that could have ensured White was placed in a facility where she wouldn’t pose a risk to herself or others weren’t taken.Despite what happened in White’s case, Bishop defends the system, which is meant to protect transgender people from harm as well as the general prison population, as workable. “It is almost the exception that proves the rule,” she told the , “you’ve just got to look at what went wrong and make sure it doesn’t happen again. No system is perfect.”According to a government survey, there are 125 known transgender prisoners in England and Wales, though the Ministry of Justice says the actual number is probably higher. Nearly half of the 125 identified have been convicted of one or more sexual offenses.",

        "evidence": "As an impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump’s actions commenced in October 2019, so did partisan invocations of whataboutism — a logical fallacy that involves “a reversal of accusation, arguing that an opponent is guilty of an offense just as egregious or worse than what the original party was accused of doing, however unconnected the offenses may be.”\nOne example of such was a video clip posted to C-SPAN’s website on Sept. 21, 2019 under the title “Joe Biden Confesses to Bribery.” The video was accompanied by a caption reading “Former Vice President Joe Biden confesses to being in charge of Ukraine for the Obama Administration, and withholding $1 billion in loan guarantees from the USA to force Ukraine to fire prosecutor who was looking into the company that Hunter Biden was receiving $83,000+ PER MONTH from”:\nThe user-created clip fostered a false impression by pairing a misleading caption with an excerpt from a much longer video with no context. (The video carries a statement from C-SPAN noting that “This clip, title, and description were not created by C-SPAN.”)\nPresident Trump has been accused by a whistleblower, and is under a House-led impeachment inquiry, for allegedly attempting to coerce Ukraine into provide damaging information on Trump political rival Joe Biden by withholding crucial military aid from that country. The video on C-SPAN’s website attempted to show Biden, a potential political rival for the presidency in 2020, admitting to a parallel wrongdoing during a trip to Ukraine in 2016:\nAnd I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev. And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn’t.\nSo they said they had — they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I’m not going to — or, we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You’re not the president. The president said — I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\nThe video clip was taken from a portion of a talk Biden gave in January 2018 at a Council on Foreign Relations meeting in Washington, D.C., which was held in conjunction with the publication of the January/February issue of Foreign Affairs magazine. Biden had co-authored an article for that month’s issue with former White House official Michael Carpenter, titled “How to Stand Up to the Kremlin: Defending Democracy Against Its Enemies.”\nIn the excerpted portion of the clip, Biden was discussing his efforts on behalf of the Obama administration to pressure Ukraine into prosecuting corruption and firing Viktor Shokin, an ineffective prosecutor. That effort by Biden has been used by Trump supporters to argue, inaccurately, that Biden single-handedly had Shokin fired because Shokin was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian group of energy exploration and production companies of which Biden’s son Hunter was a board member.\nHowever, Shokin was not fired for investigating Burisma, but for his failure to pursue corruption investigations — including investigations connected to Burisma. And Biden wasn’t alone in the effort to push Shokin out, but rather was spearheading the Obama administration’s policy, which represented a consensus among diplomats, officials from various European countries, and the International Monetary Fund that Shokin was an impediment to rooting out corruption in his country, according to Bloomberg:\nShokin became prosecutor general in February 2015. Over the next year, the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund criticized officials for not doing enough to fight corruption in Ukraine …\nThe U.S. plan to push for Shokin’s dismissal didn’t initially come from Biden, but rather filtered up from officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. Embassy personnel had called for U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine to be tied to broader anti-corruption efforts, including Shokin’s dismissal, this person said.\nBiden’s threat to withhold $1 billion [in U.S. loan guarantees] if Ukraine didn’t crack down on corruption reportedly came in March [2016]. That same month, hundreds of Ukrainians demonstrated outside President Petro Poroshenko’s office demanding Shokin’s resignation, and he was dismissed.\nMoreover, among the reasons the U.S. and others sought Shokin’s ouster was his failure to assist with or pursue an investigation of Burisma Holdings’ owner:\nHunter Biden joined [Burisma’s] board in April 2014, two months after U.K. authorities requested information from Ukraine as part of a probe against [Burisma Holdings owner Mykola] Zlochevsky related to money laundering allegations. Zlochevsky had been minister of environmental protection under then-President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in February 2014 after mass protests.\nAfter the U.K. request, Ukrainian prosecutors opened their own case, accusing Zlochevsky of embezzling public funds. Burisma and Zlochevsky have denied the allegations.\nThe case against Zlochevsky and his Burisma Holdings was assigned to Shokin, then a deputy prosecutor. But Shokin and others weren’t pursuing it, according to the internal reports from the Ukrainian prosecutor’s office reviewed by Bloomberg.\nIn a December 2014 letter, U.S. officials warned Ukrainian prosecutors of negative consequences for Ukraine over its failure to assist the U.K., which had seized Zlochevsky’s assets, according to the documents.\nShokin took no action to pursue cases against Zlochevsky throughout 2015, said [Vitaliy] Kasko, who was Shokin’s deputy overseeing international cooperation and helping in asset-recovery investigations. Kasko said he had urged Shokin to pursue the investigations.\n“There was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close cases against Zlochevsky,” Kasko said in an interview. “It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.”\nThat’s not to say the former vice president’s 2018 commentary at the Council on Foreign Relations meeting was worded well. Before his remarks morphed into “evidence” for claims that Biden ordered Ukraine to fire Shokin for investigating Burisma, they were picked up by Russian government-controlled outlets such as RT and Sputnik to levy accusations that the Obama administration was engaged in heavy-handed meddling in Ukraine’s affairs.\nBiden’s remarks can bee seen in full in the video below:",

        "evidence": "Some critics of Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded with a measure of ridicule and criticism in the Spring of 2019, after remarks she made about the introduction of the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which imposed a two-term limit on the U.S. presidency.The , for example, wrote:That article was re-published on the website of Fox News, along with the headline “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez alsely claims Republicans amended Constitution to kick FDR out of office.”The  joined in the criticism, writing:A video clip of Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks was prominently shared on Twitter by Tom Elliott, who added: “According to AOC, Congress amended the Constitution to prevent FDR from being re-elected: ‘They had to amend the Constitution of the United States to make sure Roosevelt dd not get reelected.’ (Reminder, FDR died in office in 1945; the 22nd Amendment came in 1947).” Critics of Ocasio-Cortez pounced on her remarks as evidence of a purported lack of historical knowledge on her part. However, the Congresswoman’s subsequent comments on the subject, along with clarification provided by her spokesperson, indicated the intended meaning of her remarks was that the  behind the development of the two-term limit (which was ultimately enshrined in the 22nd amendment) had been Roosevelt’s repeated re-elections during the 1930s and 1940s, and not that the introduction of the 22nd amendment (as opposed to Roosevelt’s death) prevented what would have been his fourth re-election.The Congresswoman’s remarks came during a web-only question-and-answer session recorded during her appearance on MSNBC’s “All In” with Chris Hayes on 29 March, whose focus was the “Green New Deal,” a plan put forward by Ocasio-Cortez ;and fellow Democrat Senator Ed Markey to tackle climate change and create jobs centered around renewable energy.Mark Paul, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning think tank, asked Ocasio-Cortez what lessons she had learned from the “New Deal,” the series of economic projects FDR introduced in the 1930s with the intention of helping the U.S. economy to recover from the Great Depression, and the program to which the “Green New Deal” is an allusion.One of the points Ocasio-Cortez made in response to that question was to highlight the importance of Democratic success in facilitating the passage of legislation that introduced New Deal programs. Here’s a (lightly edited) transcript of that segment, which can be viewed below:The point Ocasio-Cortez was making in that section of the interview was to highlight the role that electoral success for Democrats — not least of which was FDR’s repeated presidential victories during the 1930s and 1940s — played in facilitating the introduction of major reforms such as the New Deal programs. FDR was first elected in 1932, then re-elected three times, in 1936, 1940, and 1944.To illustrate the extent of FDR’s power and popularity at that time, the Congresswoman said: “They had to amend the Constitution of the United States to make sure Roosevelt did not get re-elected.”The manner in which she phrased that statement (“They had to … to make sure”) indicated, on its face, that Ocasio-Cortez was saying that the introduction of the two-term limit in the 22nd Amendment was  in order to prevent FDR from being re-elected a fourth time.It is therefore understandable that some commentators seized upon her remarks and made the rather obvious point that the 22nd Amendment was not required to prevent FDR’s fourth re-election, because FDR died in 1945, six years before the amendment was ratified and came into effect.(FDR died two years before the U.S. Congress passed the amendment, but it was not  until it was ratified by the requisite number of states six years after his death, contrary to the ‘s inaccurate statement that he had died “two years before presidential term limits were implemented.”)However, that was not the intended meaning of Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks, according to a spokesperson for the Congresswoman. The spokesperson told us it was “pretty clear” that her intention was simply to point out that FDR’s repeated re-elections, and the sustained implementation of his policy agenda, had been the  for Republican efforts to introduce a term limit on the U.S. presidency, a plan that began while FDR was still alive.That this was Ocasio-Cortez’s intended meaning is also supported by the fact that the Congresswoman approvingly tweeted out a  article that presented the “full story” behind her remarks, which reported that:It is unquestionably true that efforts to introduce a two-term limit on the U.S. presidency began before FDR’s death and were intensified by his unprecedented third and fourth elections in 1940 and 1944.FDR’s decision to break precedent and seek a third term in 1940 was in itself a significant part of Republican candidate Wendell Willkie’s platform that year. In a speech accepting his party’s nomination in August 1940, Willkie said: “I should like to debate the question of the assumption by this President, in seeking a third term, of a greater public confidence than was accorded to our presidential giants, Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson.”In a newspaper advertisement published days before the election, Republicans put “The Third Term” at the top of a list of major issues, writing: “Violating all principles of freedom, and a sacred American tradition of 150 years standing, the President forced his own nomination for a third term at the Chicago convention … and gave as an excuse I was drafted.’ Are we Americans that gullible? … Let us say together, ‘There is no indispensible man. There shall be no third term.'”(In order to avoid the controversy of actively seeking to break the two-term tradition, FDR coyly declined to openly declare himself a candidate in 1940, and instead his supporters arranged for him to be “drafted” as a nominee by delegates at the 1940 Democratic National Convention.)In a statement issued the day before the election, Willkie called specifically for a constitutional amendment to limit the presidency to eight years, saying that “When elected, in order to prevent any subsequent demonstrations of such ambitious views, in my first message to Congress I shall recommend that they submit a constitutional amendment limiting the time any one president may serve to eight years or less.”Before FDR’s third re-election in 1944, his Republican opponent, Thomas Dewey, also called for a term limit of the kind ultimately encapsulated in the 22nd Amendment. In a speech delivered in Buffalo, New York, just days before the election, Dewey said a fourth term for FDR would be “the most dangerous threat to our freedom ever proposed,” adding, “I believe that two terms must be established as the limit by constitutional amendment.”FDR won his fourth presidential election that year, but he died just five months later, in April 1945, leaving Vice President Harry Truman to serve out nearly all of what would have been his fourth term.After the House of Representatives and Senate switched from Democratic to Republican control in the 1946 mid-term elections, the path was cleared for the 22nd amendment, which was passed by Congress in 1947. It eventually entered the U.S. Constitution in February 1951, when Nevada and Utah became the 35th and 36th U.S. states to ratify it, providing the required approval by three-quarters of the states. (The U.S. comprised only 48 states in 1951, with Alaska and Hawaii joining the Union in 1959.)The 22nd amendment states, in part:What Rep. Ocasio-Cortez said on MSNBC on 29 March was that, “They had to amend the Constitution of the United States to make sure Roosevelt did not get re-elected.” It is understandable that some of her critics viewed this as her saying that the introduction of the 22nd Amendment was  to prevent FDR’s fourth re-election, an assertion which would make no sense because FDR died in 1945, six years before the amendment entered into force.However, according to clarification provided to Snopes by her spokesperson, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s intended meaning was simply to point out that the  for efforts to amend the U.S. Constitution and impose a two-term limit had been FDR’s repeated re-elections during the 1930s and 1940s. As we have shown, that is certainly true, and calls for such a constitutional amendment began to intensify even before FDR’s second re-election in 1940, almost five years before his death.",

        "evidence": "In November 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about a widely publicized anecdote that claimed a film studio executive in the 1990s once demonstrated such ignorance as to propose casting Julia Roberts as the 19th-century black abolitionist activist Harriet Tubman. \nThe claim was made by the screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard, who famously wrote the screenplay for the 2000 film “Remember the Titans” and co-wrote the script for “Harriet,” a 2019 film about the life of Tubman released in late 2019.\nThe “Julia Roberts” proposal was widely reported, with articles and television segments repeating the claim published by TMZ, CNN, WXIA-TV, The Guardian, and Us Weekly. Wendy Williams also devoted a segment of her Nov. 20 talk show to the claims, calling them “really disgusting”:\n  \nWe were unable to verify the accuracy of claims that a Hollywood film executive in the mid-1990s earnestly proposed casting Roberts as Tubman. As such, those claims remain unproven. If information or evidence emerges that definitively corroborates Howard’s claims, we will update this fact check accordingly. \nIn an interview with the film distribution company Focus Features, published on Nov. 1, 2019, Howard described the many difficulties he had encountered in getting his screenplay about the life of Tubman produced. He said:\n“Harriet,” which was set up at Disney 26 years ago, was my first assignment. When I got in the business, I wanted to tell these historical stories by turning them into entertainment. I didn’t want to give history lessons. I wanted to turn Harriet Tubman’s life, which I’d studied in college, into an action-adventure movie.\nThe climate in Hollywood, however, was very different back then. I was told how one studio head said in a meeting, “This script is fantastic. Let’s get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman.” When someone pointed out that Roberts couldn’t be Harriet, the executive responded, “It was so long ago. No one is going to know the difference.” \nTwo films really changed the climate in Hollywood to allow Harriet to be made. When “12 Years a Slave” became a hit and did a couple hundred million dollars worldwide, I told my agent, “You can’t say this kind of story won’t make money now.” Then “Black Panther” really blew the doors open. [Emphasis added].\nHoward told a similar story in a Nov. 19 column he wrote for the Los Angeles Times, writing:\nPicture 1994: “This is a great script. Let’s get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman,” said the then-president of a studio sublabel. Fortunately, there was a single black person in that studio meeting 25 years ago who told him that Harriet Tubman was a black woman. The president replied, “That was so long ago. No one will know that.” Thus began the epic 25-year journey of getting my Harriet Tubman script to the screen.\nWe put a series of questions to a representative for Howard, asking for any details or additional information that might corroborate his anecdote. We asked for the names of both the studio president in question and the third party who supposedly reported the executive’s suggestion back to Howard (who does not claim to have been in the room), so that we could contact them and ask them about the anecdote.\nWe also asked Howard’s representative whether it was possible that Howard had misinterpreted or misunderstood what the third party told him, or that the third party had misinterpreted or misunderstood what the studio executive had said. Unfortunately, we did not receive a response of any kind.\nWe found no record of any reference to the Roberts/Tubman suggestion in an extensive news archive that covered the period since the early 1990s and beyond, nor in the Internet Archive.\nThe only reference we found that did not come from Howard himself and pre-dated November 2019 was in an October 2018 tweet posted by the young adult novelist Sherri Smith. In response to a report that the white filmmaker and writer Lena Dunham had been asked to write a screen adaptation of a book about a Syrian refugee’s experience, Smith tweeted:\n“Reminds me of my favorite development story. When pitched a Harriet Tubman movie, the exec said, ‘Great, I think we can get Julia Roberts for the lead.'”\nThis is essentially the same anecdote later recounted by Howard in November 2019. Smith told Snopes she might have heard the story when she was an intern in the development department of Columbia Pictures in 1992 or 1993, but she added that it was “likely apocryphal.” \nInterestingly, the notion of Roberts playing Tubman has been the subject of multiple jokes on social media in recent years, especially as part of a broader conversation about “whitewashing” — the practice of casting white actors to play non-white roles. \nWe also contacted the office of Roberts’ publicist, in an effort to discover whether Roberts herself might be able to corroborate Howard’s story. The person who answered the phone declined to allow Snopes to leave a voicemail for the publicist and would not provide an email address, but said, “We’re not responding at this time” to questions about Howard’s anecdote.  \nHoward did not name any of the individuals involved in his story, and his representative did not respond to our inquiries, meaning we could not contact those individuals directly and ask them to corroborate Howard’s claims.\nWe could find only one previous reference to a movie executive suggesting Roberts for the role of Tubman. That reference did not provide any further details, and the person who posted it on Twitter told Snopes she thought it was probably not true. Finally, the office of Roberts’ publicist declined to comment on anything related to Howard’s anecdote. \nWhat he described might have taken place. But, despite our extensive efforts to find corroborating evidence, which included inviting Howard himself to provide further details, we found no evidence to either support or dismiss his claims. As such, those claims remain unproven. If decisive evidence emerges, we will update this fact check accordingly. ",

        "evidence": "In late 2019, concerned readers asked us about a series of widely shared Facebook posts that claimed to include photographic evidence of a new tactic being employed by sex traffickers in the state of Florida, and in the city of Tampa, in particular. \nThe earliest example of the post that we found was published on Nov. 19. It included three photographs that appeared to show a road at night, with a car pulled over and a person lying on his or her back in the middle of the road. The message read:\n“This Shit Happened To My Lil Brother Last Night In Tampa, Sex Trafficking Is Real, These People Lay In The Middle Of The Road And Act Like Their Car Broke Down Or Play Hurt For You To Stop. When U Get Out The Car They Attack. If Y’all See Anything Like This, Don’t Hesitate To Run Their Ass Over. If U Scared Then Try Your Best To Go Around, But Whatever You Do, Don’t Get Out Of Your Car, Lock Your Doors And Keep It Moving….!!!!!!!!!!!”\n\nOver the course of the following days and weeks, the same or similar messages, using the same photographs, were shared hundreds of thousands of times. In some cases, the “lying in the road” method was identified as a sex trafficking ruse specific to Tampa, and in other cases specific to the state of Florida. In still other instances, no geographic marker was provided, giving many readers the impression that sex traffickers all across the United States were using the same ruse. In each case, the Facebook post claimed that the photographs were merely one illustration of a broader trend of incidents, and that the purported “lying-in-the-road” ruse was a prevalent sex trafficking tactic. \nIn reality, we found no evidence to support or corroborate the claim that a pattern of incidents existed, in Tampa, in Florida, or anywhere in the United States, in which sex traffickers attempted to kidnap unsuspecting motorists by tricking them into stopping their cars by lying in the middle of the road. Nor did we find any evidence that the photographs included in the November and December 2019 Facebook posts showed a specific incident of attempted sex trafficking. \nA spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (akin to the “state police” found in other states) told Snopes that the agency “has not heard of this tactic in Tampa or elsewhere.” A spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department told Snopes much the same and emphasized that “No such incident took place in Tampa.” The spokesperson added, “We have not heard of this method or tactic being used in our jurisdiction.”\nA spokesperson for the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office (the county where Tampa is located) also told Snopes: “No reports have been filed related to this incident or matching what is described in the post, so we can not confirm if it is related to human trafficking or if it is even real.”\nLaura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told Snopes in a statement that:\n“Our organization is not aware of any reports of human trafficking similar to the one described in these viral social media posts … Although it may be possible that in isolated incidents human trafficking attempts like this have occurred in the past, it is unlikely that this is a common trend.”\nBoth Theresa Prichard, associate director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, and Kathleen Kempe, senior director of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, also told Snopes they had never heard of any such sex trafficking tactic. \nIt’s not clear what the origins of the photographs were. We put a series of questions to the Cornelius King Facebook account above where the trafficking post originated, requesting to speak to his brother, who according to the post was a firsthand witness to the alleged incident shown in the photographs. We asked whether he, his brother, or anyone else had reported the alleged incident to any law enforcement agency, the exact time and location of the incident, and we requested any evidence that might corroborate the claim that the alleged incident was connected to sex trafficking. We received no response. \nIt’s also unclear whether the photographs were authentic or staged, perhaps as part of a stunt, prank, advertisement, or film of some kind. If they were authentic, it’s not clear what the motives or state of mind were of the person shown lying in the road. The photographs themselves do not contain any elements or features whose presence indicates a connection to sex trafficking, in particular, as opposed to several other explanations.\nSince we have not yet discovered the origins of, and facts surrounding, the photographs, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that they show a specific instance of attempted kidnapping or sex trafficking. However, based on the responses provided by several law enforcement agencies and relevant non-profit organizations, we can say that no broader pattern or trend of incidents exists in Tampa, or Florida, or in the United States, whereby motorists are tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the middle of the road, as part of a sex trafficking plot. \nAll of the widely shared Facebook posts cited above claimed that the photographs were an illustration of a broader trend. As a result, we are issuing a rating of “False.”",

        "evidence": "In the aftermath of a series of hurricanes in September 2017 — particularly Maria, which devastated the United States territory of Puerto Rico — President Donald Trump reflected on the infrastructural damage caused by those storms in a 25 September 2017 tweet:In response, public relations and marketing executive Lainie Green issued a series of tweets that went viral, accusing President Trump of having added to Puerto Rico’s debt by bankrupting a golf course there and defaulting on $33 million worth of government-issued bonds:Green’s account of the episode got some facts right, but it also left out some important context necessary for any assessment of Trump’s responsibility for the bankruptcy of the golf course.According to documents first detailed in a 2016  investigation, in 2008 Trump International entered into an arrangement with the owners of Coco Beach Golf & Country Club, a foundering resort and golf course that had opened in 2004 on the northeast coast of Puerto Rico about 30 miles from San Juan. Under the agreement, the future president’s company licensed the Trump name to the owners and took on a share of the resort’s day-to-day management in exchange for a fee.The owners of the resort, which was renamed Trump International Golf Club Puerto Rico after 2008, had already received significant financial assistance from the Puerto Rican government before Trump’s intervention. In 2000 and 2004, Puerto Rico’s Industrial, Tourist, Educational, Medical and Environmental Control Facilities Financing Authority (AFICA) issued the owners of the club a total of $25,497,854 in bonds to help build and launch the resort. In 2009, the Puerto Rican government also invested $50 million in the Hotel Gran Melia, which was part of the resort and provided a crucial stream of customers for the golf club, according to .By October 2011, Coco Beach had defaulted on $26 million in bonds and had to seek another round of financing. In 2015, the company filed for bankruptcy under its original name, Coco Beach Golf and Country Club, citing debts of more than $78 million but only $9 million in assets. Bankruptcy court records show that Puerto Rico’s Tourism Development Fund made a claim of $32,606,821, essentially leaving Puerto Rican taxpayers on the hook for the better part of $33 million.Does all this mean that Trump “bankrupted” the golf course, though? Not exactly.The evidence shows that Coca Beach had consistently been operating at a loss and accumulating debts in the years before Trump International became involved with its management. And a significant portion of the financial assistance provided by the Puerto Rican government was given in 2000 and 2004, well before the future U.S. president’s company arrived on the scene.Puerto Rico had already been hard hit by a recession well before the Trump International contracted to assist with the club’s management, and in the two years before Trump International’s intervention (2006-07), Coco Beach operated at an average annual net loss of $5.3 million, according to . Moreover, neither Donald Trump nor Trump International held an ownership stake in the property, took part in its development, or was involved with its financing; they only operated and managed the resort. Holding Trump to be solely or primarily responsible for the bankruptcy of a business they didn’t own, that was already heavily in debt, and was losing several million dollars a year before Trump arrived on the scene would be something of an unfair standard.However, one could argue that Trump International received a good deal of money from the Coco Beach deal yet failed to turn the club around, or even stanch its financial bleeding. According to the March 2011 bond offering (which was itself required to cover losses on the Puerto Rican government’s 2000 and 2004 bond investments), Trump International had given certain assurances about the future viability of the resort:Whatever that plan was, it did not succeed. The 2012 financials show that the club’s average annual losses rose to $6.3 million during the period that Trump’s company provided management services to the resort (2008-2012), $1 million more per year than the business had been losing before. Further, for this lack of success, Trump International garnered a total of $609,607 in management fees between 2008 and 2012. (This figure is likely the source of Lainie Green’s reference to a “$600,000 paycheck” received by Donald Trump.)Donald Trump did not set Coco Beach Golf and Country Club on course for ruin, but he wasn’t able to save it from that fate. His role in the bankruptcy of the company, which ended up costing Puerto Rican taxpayers $32.6 million, was significant but limited. That $32.6 million loss constituted 0.03 percent of the territory’s total $123 billion debt, which prompted the Puerto Rican government to file for bankruptcy relief in May 2017.",

The text of the meme also asserted the Texas politician had been arrested twice, once on suspicion of burglary and again on suspicion of drunken driving, during the 1990s:The claims made in this meme are largely accurate, although a few inaccuracies should be noted.The man seen on the left in the above-displayed image truly is O’Rourke (who reportedly played bass guitar). While the meme stated that O’Rourke was in a band called the El Paso Pussycats, his band was actually named “Foss.” This photograph was used for the cover of an EP that Foss released in 1993, and the name of the EP, not the band itself, was “El Paso Pussycats.”O’Rourke talked to  in August 2018 (this meme first received attention during the 2018 midterm elections, hence the mention of O’Rourke’s “Texas Deserves Better” U.S. Senate campaign slogan), and he shared an audio file of the band’s song “Rise” with the magazine:This meme correctly states that O’Rourke was arrested twice in the 1990s, once on suspicion of burglary and once on suspicion of driving while under the influence.

        "evidence": "On Feb. 28, 2020, the website PJ Media published an article claiming that U.S. President Barack Obama had waited until millions were infected and thousands were dead from swine flu, the H1N1 virus, before declaring a public health emergency in 2009. The article, which was presented as a “fact check,” got several simple details wrong.\n\nIn response to criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump’s handling of a recent outbreak of a new coronavirus, the PJ Media article opined that Obama had been lackadaisical about his response to a health emergency back in 2009, and that Trump by comparison had done his job admirably.\nPJ Media writes:\nSurely, St. Barack of Obama would have dealt with this horrible pandemic better than Orange Man Bad, right? No-Drama-Obama had this whole thing under control, of course!\nWell, let’s compare and contrast…\nNow, let’s go to the Wayback Machine. In April of 2009, the H1N1 became a pandemic.\nBut it wasn’t until six months later, October, that then-President Obama declared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic. By that time, the disease had infected millions of Americans and more than 1,000 people had died in the U.S.\nThere are several factual inaccuracies in this excerpt alone. For instance, PJ media writes that H1N1 became a pandemic in April 2009. But that’s not the case. The disease emerged in April but wasn’t declared a pandemic until June.\nThe excerpt also claims that Obama “declared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic” in October 2009. But this is also wrong. Obama declared a national emergency, not a public health emergency, in October 2009. The Obama administration declared a public health emergency in April, months before swine flu was declared a pandemic. At the time that the Obama administration declared a public health emergency, only 20 confirmed cases (not over a million) of H1N1 existed in the United States.\nThe New York Times reported on April 26, 2009:\nResponding to what some health officials feared could be the leading edge of a global pandemic emerging from Mexico, American health officials declared a public health emergency on Sunday as 20 cases of swine flu were confirmed in this country, including eight in New York City.\n[…] The emergency declaration in the United States lets the government free more money for antiviral drugs and give some previously unapproved tests and drugs to children. One-quarter of the national stockpile of 50 million courses of antiflu drugs will be released.\nPJ Media also inaccurately presented a video in the article as if it showed Obama addressing the swine flu after it had “already become a pandemic.” Again, that simply isn’t the case. When Obama addressed the nation about swine flu, or H1N1, in April 2009, the disease was just starting to spread. It wouldn’t be until June 2009 that the swine flu would be declared a pandemic. \nHere’s Obama’s April 2009 address:\nThe swine flu pandemic spread quickly across the United States starting in April 2009. There were approximately 60 million cases over the course of the following year, which resulted in nearly 275,000 hospitalizations and more than 12,000 deaths.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a detailed timeline of this pandemic on its website. It shows that the CDC first activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) on April 22, 2009. At the time, there were only two confirmed cases in the United States. On April 25, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern, and the following day the Obama administration did the same. At that time, there were about 20 confirmed cases. \nDespite the CDC’s efforts, the swine flu continued to spread. Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of health and human services, renewed the emergency declaration on July 24, 2009, and then again on Oct. 1, 2009. On Oct. 24, 2009, Obama declared a national emergency that gave officials more resources to fight the pandemic.\nThe Associated Press reported:\nPresident Barack Obama has declared the swine flu outbreak a national emergency, giving his health chief the power to let hospitals move emergency rooms offsite to speed treatment and protect noninfected patients.\nThe declaration, signed Friday night and announced Saturday, comes with the disease more prevalent than ever in the country and production delays undercutting the government’s initial, optimistic estimates that as many as 120 million doses of the vaccine could be available by mid-October.\n[…]\nOn April 26, the administration declared swine flu a public health emergency, allowing the shipment of roughly 12 million doses of flu-fighting medications from a federal stockpile to states in case they eventually needed them. At the time, there were 20 confirmed cases in the U.S. of people recovering easily. There was no vaccine against swine flu, but the CDC had taken the initial step necessary for producing one.\n“As a nation, we have prepared at all levels of government, and as individuals and communities, taking unprecedented steps to counter the emerging pandemic,” Obama wrote in Saturday’s declaration.\nIn sum, the PJ Media article claimed that Obama “waited” until millions of people were infected with H1N1 before he declared an “emergency.” But that isn’t the case. The Obama administration started to address H1N1 just as the disease emerged in April 2009. A public health emergency was declared on April 26, 2009, when there were about 20 confirmed cases in the United States. The Obama administration renewed this declaration twice in the ensuing months before declaring a national emergency in October 2009. ",

        "evidence": "Inaccurate messages about the new coronavirus are spreading and mutating online. One frequently copied and pasted bit of text that has gone viral on Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp purports to impart “serious excellent advice” from “Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.”\nThat “advice” asserts regular sips of water can prevent the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, from entering the respiratory system:\nSERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.  Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY?  Even if the virus gets into your mouth … drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in tummy … your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don’t drink enough water more regularly … the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That’s very dangerous.\nThe “serious excellent advice by Japanese doctors” text is often combined with other viral coronavirus claims including a paragraph about a “self-check” attributed to “Taiwan experts,” and a set of recommendations that begins with a claim about differentiating between a cold and COVID-19. Snopes addressed the “Taiwan experts self-check” claim here and addressed the list of tips that begins with a dubious method of distinguishing a cold from COVID-19 here. This article deals only with the claim regarding sipping water every 15 minutes.\nIt is true that COVID-19 infects the respiratory system by directly entering the body through the mouth or nose. This fact is central to both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to wash hands frequently and avoid touching your face. The assertion in this viral “advice,” however, is that if the virus were already in your mouth, water would help wash it away. Though medical officials recommend drinking water during any infection, no evidence exists to support the notion that sipping water prevents a virus from infecting the respiratory system.\nDrinking more water, while good for your overall health, will not keep anyone from catching the coronavirus, according to Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. Schaffner told The Associated Press, “We always caution anyone healthy and people who are sick to keep up fluid intake and keep mucus membranes moist.” He also said: “It makes you feel better; there is no clear indication that it directly protects you against complications.”\nDr. Susan Wootton, an infectious disease expert at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, agreed with that assessment, telling KHOU that no data exist to support the claim that sipping water will prevent infection by transporting it to the stomach.\nBecause no evidence supports the claim, we rank the notion that sipping water regularly prevents COVID-19 infection as “False.”",

        "evidence": "Wearing a face covering in public during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic is sound advice (and in some circumstances a legal requirement) that could help slow the spread of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But just how effective are these masks? In April 2020, many social media users encountered a simple chart that supposedly showed how effective face masks could be at preventing coronavirus infections:\n\nWe’re skeptical about the accuracy of this chart. It doesn’t appear to have originated with a reputable source; this meme does not specify the type of mask (homemade cloth mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask) used in the chart; and we were unable to find any studies that confirm these specific percentages. \nWe’ve seen this chart posted by a variety of accounts on several different platforms but have yet to come across any information about who created it. While we’re not certain if this chart was created by an anonymous social media user (social media has been a hotbed of bad medical information during the COVID-19 pandemic) or from a reputable organization, the evidence indicates that it came from the former. \nWe were not, for instance, able to find this chart on the CDC website. The CDC even has a page dedicated to “Respiratory Protection Infographics,” but the above-displayed chart is not included on that page. This chart is also absent from the CDC’s page that recommends the use of cloth face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe CDC confirmed to us that it did not create this chart and that the agency could not confirm the accuracy of these statistics. At the moment, a spokesperson told us, there is not enough data to “quantify risk reduction from the use of masks.”\nThe punctuation in this chart may provide a clue about its origins. While the percent sign is commonly placed after the number in English and many other languages, this symbol comes before the number in Turkish. As luck would have it, we found a variation of this chart in Turkish that has been circulating on Facebook since April 10:\n\nIn addition to this chart’s unknown origins, another reason to be skeptical of these numbers is that this social media post does not identify the type of mask being used. Is this chart about homemade cloth masks? Surgical masks? Or the N95 respirator mask? These masks all provide different levels of protection against the spread of disease, with the N95 being the most effective. \nThe FDA explains the differences:\nCDC Recommends Cloth Face Coverings for Use by the General Public: The CDC recommends that members of the public use simple cloth face coverings when in a public setting to slow the spread of the virus, since this will help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.\nSurgical Masks: … If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching your mouth and nose. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of your saliva and respiratory secretions to others.\nWhile a surgical mask may be effective in blocking splashes and large-particle droplets, a face mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures. Surgical masks also do not provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants because of the loose fit between the surface of the face mask and your face.\nN95 Respirators: An N95 respirator is a respiratory protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles.\nThe ‘N95’ designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.\nThe CDC elaborated on the purpose of wearing homemade cloth masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC writes that since many people with coronavirus may be “asymptomatic,” meaning that they don’t show any symptoms, wearing a cloth mask can prevent these contagious individuals from unknowingly spreading the disease:\nCDC continues to study the spread and effects of the novel coronavirus across the United States. We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.\nIt is critical to emphasize that maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus. CDC is additionally advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.\nThe cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.\nWhen we reached out to the CDC, a spokesperson reiterated this point, saying that wearing a mask is a good way of “strengthening the social distancing that we are already doing.”\nA spokesperson for the CDC told us:\n“As we study the virus, CDC has learned that a good proportion of individuals who have COVID-19 spread virus before they become symptomatic and a few people never have symptoms at all but are still infected and infectious. That means, that people who are not coughing or sneezing can be a source of infection for others. Something simple like speaking is enough to generate aerosols that can spread the infection to other people.\nA simple cloth mask is a way to contain respiratory secretions right at the source and not put other people at risk. The mask traps the droplets before they spread into the environment. Therefore, “my mask protects you, and your mask protects me!” It’s a way of strengthening the social distancing that we are already doing.\nThe numbers provided in the above-displayed viral social media post are also suspiciously specific. While there have been studies regarding the efficacy of masks during COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are still learning about how this disease spreads and how to best prevent it. For instance, Live Science noted that two recent studies regarding the efficacy of face masks during this pandemic came to slightly different conclusions. \nLive Science writes:\nFor the first time, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that even seemingly healthy people wear masks over their mouths and noses when venturing out of their homes into places where it is difficult to maintain distance from other people. But there is still major debate over how much masks — particularly the homemade fabric masks that the CDC recommends for the public — can slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\nResearchers, writing in two new papers, attempt to tackle the efficacy of masks, one more rigorously than the other, and come to differing conclusions. One study examined the effect of masks on seasonal coronaviruses (which cause many cases of the common cold) and found that surgical masks are helpful at reducing how much virus a sick person spreads. The other looked particularly at SARS-CoV-2 and found no effect of either surgical or fabric masks on reducing virus spread, but only had four participants and used a crude measure of viral spread.\nThe bottom line, experts say, is that masks might help keep people with COVID-19 from unknowingly passing along the virus. But the evidence for the efficacy of surgical or homemade masks is limited, and masks aren’t the most important protection against the coronavirus.\nSome experts have also expressed concern that widespread use of homemade cloth masks give people a false sense of security. The White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, said that social distancing is still the most important preventative measure a person can take during this pandemic:\n“The most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hands,” she said. “And we don’t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they’re behind a mask. Because if they’re touching things — remember your eyes are not in the mask — so if you’re touching things and then touching your eyes you’re exposing yourself in the same way.”\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reiterated this point. WHO said in a statement that “masks alone cannot stop the pandemic:” \n“Masks alone cannot stop the pandemic. Countries must continue to find, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact. Mask or no mask, there are proven things all of us can do to protect ourselves and others – keep your distance, clean your hands, cough or sneeze into your elbow, and avoid touching your face.”",

        "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."

        "evidence": "As U.S. President Donald Trump accelerated unsubstantiated attacks on the legitimacy of mail-in voting during the summer of 2020, numerous Snopes readers asked us to investigate whether the leader of the U.S. Postal Service was carrying out a nefarious scheme to help Trump win another presidential term.\nIn late July and early August, various rumors surfaced regarding Louis DeJoy, a North Carolina businessman whom the Postal Service’s governing board selected to run the agency in May 2020. For example, a viral tweet thread alleged:\nMy mailman just confirmed they have all officially been told to “SLOW THE MAIL DOWN,” per trump’s Postmaster General. …He says that there is backed up mail ALL OVER THE FLOOR. He’s never seen anything like it. It has ALREADY begun. But as long as we keep each other informed, we can beat their dirty tricks with INFORMATION.\n\nThe claim’s underlying notions were these: DeJoy was a political ally to the Republican president, and the new postmaster general had used his new authority to order Postal Service carriers and clerks to slow deliveries to help Trump win the 2020 November election. A backlog of ballots in the weeks or days before Election Day, critics of the president worried, could lead to votes going uncounted or deemed invalid due to state laws governing mail-in election deadlines.\nWhat follows is an examination of federal documents obtained by Snopes — including letters by members of Congress, campaign finance reports, and internal memos to Postal Service employees — as well as interviews with postal union representatives and a Postal Service spokesperson, to determine the legitimacy of those questions. DeJoy could not be reached for an interview for this report. \nNote: Snopes not only investigated DeJoy’s relationship to Trump, but his financial stake in companies that compete with the Postal Service to evaluate if, or to what extent, his past investments provided any evidence of a plan to undermine the Postal Service’s longstanding mission: to provide mail service to every American, no matter their address or income.\nYes. DeJoy, who lives in Greensboro, donated more than $1.2 million to the Trump campaign between August 2016 and February 2020, according to campaign finance reports compiled by the Federal Elections Commission (FEC).\nIt’s unclear when or how DeJoy developed a relationship with Trump, and why he decided to support the billionaire’s political pursuits. In a 2005 interview with Greensboro’s local newspaper, DeJoy — then-CEO of New Breed Logistics, a distribution and warehousing company — appeared less supportive of Trump, saying his self-important attitude on the reality-TV show “The Apprentice” was destructive.\n“I’d be fired,” DeJoy said, if he was a contestant.\nNonetheless, by early 2017, DeJoy was among his state’s top donors to Trump (see below for The Charlotte Observer’s list that ranks DeJoy at No. 3 with a total contribution of $111,000). And by October of that year, DeJoy had become close enough to the president to host him and other donors for fundraiser at his Greensboro house.\n\nAlso, by that time, DeJoy’s wife, Aldona Wos, had been appointed by the president to serve as vice chair of a White House commission that oversees paid fellowships in federal offices, according to the couple’s foundation website.\nIn addition to his contributions to Trump’s political campaigns specifically, DeJoy has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican causes or campaigns over decades, the FEC records show.\nThe Postal Service’s governing board, a group appointed by the president with confirmation from the Senate, selected DeJoy as Postmaster General on May 6, 2020, after what it described as an extensive nationwide search for qualified candidates. At the time of that decision, Trump had appointed all six board members — Chairman Robert Duncan, John Barger, Ron Bloom, Roman Martinez IV, Donald Moak, and William Zollars — since the early days of his presidency.\nDeJoy, who was in charge of fundraising for the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Charlotte when the board made its announcement, made the following donations since the start of 2020, according to filings from the FEC:\nIn sum, considering DeJoy’s record of donations, as well as evidence of him hosting a Trump fundraiser at his Greensboro home in fall 2017, it is accurate to claim that the new postmaster general is a political ally to the Republican president.\nThe answer to this question is less clear.\nIn summer 2020, the viral claim about DeJoy — that he had directed carriers to delay mail to benefit Trump’s reelection campaign (which we unpack below) — took on another layer: that DeJoy had also allegedly invested $70 million of his own money in delivery companies that compete with the Postal Service.\n\nThat allegation, which we deemed mostly true (see the explanation below), was particularly worrisome for critics of Trump and DeJoy, who believed the alleged holdings were more proof of the two leaders conspiring together — this time in an attempt to privatize the Postal Service.\nHere’s some context before we dive into DeJoy’s personal assets: Conservative Republicans have long pushed to remove government from mail services that they believe should be left to the private commercial market. Since Trump took office, he has called the Postal Service “a joke” or Amazon’s “delivery boy,” considering its package rates, and has floated the idea of eventually privatizing the agency.\nMeanwhile, others fear dismantling the federally-mandated mail service would disproportionately affect people who live in rural areas, where private companies such as FedEx and UPS either charge higher rates or do no shipments at all.\nAt the same time, the Postal Service — which does not receive tax dollars for its operating expenses — faces a worsening financial situation due to a 2006 congressional mandate that required the agency to prepay health care benefits of retirees, as well as a decline in first-class mail customers. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated those long-standing problems, forcing several post offices nationwide to completely close or scale back hours.\nFor instance, on April 9, 2020, roughly one month before DeJoy was selected to lead the Postal Service, then-Postmaster General Megan Brennan said the agency was preparing for a $13 billion revenue shortfall due “directly to COVID-19” and an additional $54.3 billion in losses over 10 years. Considering those projections, she said the agency could “run out of cash this fiscal year” — or the end of September — without federal intervention. (Brennan announced her retirement in October 2019, after more than 30 years with the agency.)\nThe former Postal Service leader made those comments shortly after federal leaders negotiated a $2.2 trillion COVID-19 economic relief package, called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which, initially, included a $13 billion one-time boost for the mail service. But, purportedly at the urging of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and aides to Trump, congressional leaders removed that provision from the stimulus package, and instead included a $10 billion loan that the Trump administration could leverage in its favor. Then, on July 29, 2020, The Washington Post reported that under DeJoy’s leadership, the postal agency gave Mnuchin’s office’s proprietary information about the Postal Service’s most lucrative private-sector contracts, such as Amazon, FedEx and UPS, in exchange for the loan money.\nBy that time, Congressional leaders and Trump were battling yet again over another emergency relief package; Democrats proposed a $25 billion boost for the Postal Service but then lowered that amount to $10 billion during talks with Republicans.\nOn Aug. 13, 2020, during an interview on Fox Business Network, the president said frankly the tug-and-pull over Postal Service funding was part of his administration’s plan to try to make it harder for the agency to handle the expected surge in mail-in ballots in the November election. “If we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money,” Trump told host Maria Bartiromo, referring to the false claim that Democrats are are proposing a universal mail-in voting system. “That means they can’t have universal mail-in voting; they just can’t have it.”\nWhich brings us to DeJoy’s assets, and the above-mentioned claim that he had “$70 million invested in companies that compete with USPS.” For the basis of this analysis, we considered private companies that provide shipping or distribution services, such as DHL, the FedEx Corporation, and United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), business competitors with the post office.\nFor more than 30 years, DeJoy was the CEO of New Breed Logistics, a supply chain business that contracted with a variety of public and private companies, including the Postal Service. In 2014, XPO Logistics acquired DeJoy’s company, and he served on the company’s executive team or board of directors until May 2018. According to internal documents, which we obtained using the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) database of company filings, XPO Logistics considered its competitors to include DHL, FedEx, UPS, and J.B. Hunt Transport Services. \nAside from that evidence, which proved DeJoy’s former company competed for business with organizations that also competed with the Postal Service, Snopes uncovered a letter from his wife, Wos, to a White House legal advisor on January 3, 2020, that listed her family’s financial assets, known as “Attachment A.” According to that list, the family had stock in companies including UPS, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., and XPO Logistics, Inc.\nShe wrote the letter in response to a nomination by the Trump administration to serve as U.S. ambassador to Canada, and she said she would divest from all holdings in the document within 90 days of her confirmation. However, as of this writing, Wos had not been sworn into the position. The letter, which was available via the Office of Government Ethics, read:\n\nAs of June 15, 2020, the day DeJoy assumed his role as postmaster general, The Washington Post reported the couple had between $30.1 million and $75.3 million in assets in Postal Service competitors or contractors. XPO Logistics represented the vast majority of those investments, and the couple’s combined stake in UPS and trucking company J.B. Hunt, for examples, was roughly $265,000.\nOn DeJoy’s first day, the Senate’s top Democrat, Charles Schumer of New York, said in letter to the Postal Service’s board of governors’ chairman: “[DeJoy’s] financial interests in companies that have business ties with the Postal Services, as well as his extensive campaign fundraising efforts, raise questions” over his ethical conflicts of interest and partisan interests.\nBy that point, a spokeswoman for DeJoy told journalists he had resigned as finance chair for the Republican National Convention, and would “comply with any financial divestitures that are required” for the new leadership position.\nIn sum, reports proved the DeJoy family at one point had millions of dollars in assets in companies that compete or contract with the Postal Service, which lend credibility to the viral assertion.\nBut the exact amount of such investments was unclear, and as of this writing, it was unknown if or to what extent the couple had divested any of the financial holdings.\nNot exactly — but there is some truth to the claim.\nUpon our analysis, the rumor seems to have stemmed from a series of directives DeJoy gave Postal Service employees since he took over the agency. On his first day, for example, he addressed the agency in a video that alluded to impending changes under his leadership that aimed to create a “viable operating model,” though he did not go into specifics.\nThen, in mid-July, he issued several memos to employees, including a “New [Postmaster General’s] expectations and plan.” Those messages to all managers, clerks, and carriers nationwide appeared to be the source of the claim, and detailed changes to how and when the Postal Agency would deliver mail.\nA July 10, 2020, internal document to managers, which Snopes received from the American Postal Workers Union and refers to an “operational pivot” for the agency, said the following, for example:\nThe initial step in our pivot is targeted on transportation and the soaring costs we incur due to late trips and extra trips, which costs the organization somewhere around $200 million in added expenses.\nThe shifts are simple, but they will be challenging, as we seek to change our culture and move away from past practices previously used.\nBut perhaps most relevant to the claim, the DeJoy-sponsored directives included instructions for employees to leave letters or packages at distribution centers if they delayed carriers from their routes — contradicting previous rules for deliveries — and said the Postal Service would no longer pay employees overtime to complete all mail deliveries. The July 10, 2020 memo said:\nOne aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that — temporarily — we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks [in Processing and Distribution Centers], which is not typical.\nWe will address root causes of these delays and adjust the very next day.\nAny mail left behind must be properly reported, and employees should ensure this action is taken with integrity and accuracy.\nAs we adjust to the ongoing pivot, which will have a number of phases, we know that operations will begin to run more efficiently and that delayed mail volumes will soon shrink significantly.\nWe also considered a separate message to employees in July 2020 that said, under a new initiative, carriers in certain regions would not sort any mail during the morning and instead clock in, retrieve sorted mail from the previous day and limit time in the office as much as possible. Then, when they returned from the streets, they would sort all available mail for the next day.\nThe agency said the extra spending on employees’ overtime or delivery trips had not improved “our performance scores,” without going into detail on what that meant, and framed the changes as necessary steps to improve its financial position. A July 27, 2020, public statement from DeJoy said:\nGiven our current situation, it is critical that the Postal Service take a fresh look at our operations and make necessary adjustments. We are highly focused on our public service mission to provide prompt, reliable, and efficient service to every person and business in this country, and to remain a part of the nation’s critical infrastructure.\nDavid Partenheimer, manager of media relations for the Postal Service, told Snopes that the postmaster general was not doing any media interviews regarding the initiatives, nor about the underlying claims of this report. In a roughly 760-word email to us, however, Partenheimer reemphasized what the agency viewed as the need for the adjustments, and said:\n“We acknowledge that temporary service impacts can occur as we redouble our efforts to conform to the current operating plans, but any such impacts will be monitored and temporary … and corrected as appropriate.”\nSoon after the directives, American Postal Workers Union President Mark Dimondstein told us in a phone interview that employees and customers across the country were noticing mail delays. In the Philadelphia region, for instance, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported situations where residents were going upwards of three weeks without receiving packages and letters, and postal union leaders and carriers said mail was piling up at offices, unscanned and unsorted.\n“When you … say this is what you have to do as workers, then that’s what we have to do — [the change] runs counter to everything that the Postal Service is about, which is we treat the mail as our own; we get it to the customer as quickly as we can,” Dimondstein said. “They’ve never seen mail backed up like this — it’s not being moved.”\nThat meant, while DeJoy had not told carriers to “slow the mail down” verbatim, he initiated changes to how and when carriers go about doing their job that the Postal Agency said would cause temporary mail delays.\nHowever, it would be inaccurate to assume all slow deliveries under DeJoy’s leadership were a result of the July 2020 directives specifically, when they could also be linked to reduced hours for some post offices or other circumstances.\nRoughly three months before the 2020 presidential election, voting rights groups and outspoken critics to the president believed the new directives by DeJoy occurred at a convenient time for Trump: when a record number of Americans were preparing to vote by mail and avoid potential exposure to the COVID-19 coronavirus by casting ballots at in-person polling places.\nSpecifically, they worried the new requirements for post office carriers and clerks would lead to backlogs of mail-in ballots and thus create challenges for elections officials who, in the majority of states, must invalidate ballots that reach them after Election Day — even if they were postmarked before that date. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, for example, led colleagues in writing a letter to DeJoy on July 20, 2020, that said:\n“While these changes [to mail service] in a normal year would be drastic, in a presidential election year when many states are relying heavily on absentee mail-in ballots, increases in mail delivery timing would impair the ability of ballots to be received and counted in a timely manner — an unacceptable outcome for a free and fair election.”\nWe asked Dimondstein, APWU president, whether he believed the July directives by Postal Service leadership were somehow linked to a plan to cause mail service chaos before the November election and help Trump win reelection. He said:\nWhat we do know for truth is this administration is, in written record, proposing and planning to sell the post office to private corporations, i.e. privatizing. …That was June 2018. We also know as a fact that …that [there are] calls for reduced service, increased prices, and less workers’ rights and benefits. So if you take those two things together, certainly if they’re implemented, then they’re going to cause delays in mail; they’re going to cause service being undermined. …\nThis is a fact: [DeJoy is] what’s considered a mega-donor of the Trump administration and the Republican party. …\nAnything that undermines the Postal Service’ [service to customers] … has us concerned that it could be linked back to those who have an agenda to eliminate [the Postal Service]. But I can’t sit here and tell you that that’s a fact.\nPartenheimer said any notion that DeJoy made decisions for the Postal Service under directions from Trump (which include claims that he issued the July 2020 changes that resulted in delays to help Trump’s re-election campaign) were “wholly misplaced and off-base.”\nHe said the Postal Service, typically an apolitical agency, remains committed to “fulfilling our role in the electoral process” in places where politicians allow voters to cast ballots by mail and “to delivering Election Mail in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards.” He elaborated:\n“[Despite] any assertions to the contrary, we are not slowing down Election Mail or any other mail. Instead, we continue to employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling of all Election Mail consistent with our standards.”\nDays later, he said in a statement to news media that “certain deadlines concerning mail-in ballots, may be incompatible with the Postal Service’s delivery standards,” especially if election officials don’t pay more for first-class postage. “To the extent that states choose to use the mail as part of their elections, they should do so in a manner that realistically reflects how the mail works,” he said.\nThen, on Aug. 18, 2020, DeJoy issued a statement in which he said he would temporarily suspend initiatives “that have been raised as areas of concern as the nation prepares to hold an election in the midst of a devastating pandemic,” including the controversial July 2020 directives that eliminated overtime and some delivery trips. The statement read:\nTo avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded.\nI want to assure all Americans of the following:\nIn addition, effective Oct. 1, we will engage standby resources in all areas of our operations, including transportation, to satisfy any unforeseen demand.\nIn sum, it was accurate to state that DeJoy, a political ally to Trump, ordered Postal Service workers to leave late-arriving mail at distribution centers for delivery the following day and eliminate extra trips in July 2020 — a change the Postal Service was expecting to cause temporary mail delays — although no verifiable evidence proved those directives were part of a deliberate scheme to disenfranchise voters in the November 2020 election. Additionally, there was no proof to show the changes aimed to help Trump win reelection.\nFor those reasons, we rate this claim “Unproven.”",

        "evidence": "The history of the subjugation of darker-skinned peoples by Western Europeans is exemplified not only in the transatlantic slave trade that thrived from the 16th through the 19th centuries, but also in the phenomenon of global colonialism, which lasted even longer.The colonies of Africa were among the last to gain independence from European rule, most not until the mid-20th century. Among them was the Belgian Congo, a Central African territory claimed by Belgium’s King Leopold II for his personal exploitation in 1885. Leopold’s 23-year misrule over his so-called “Congo Free State” was so flagrant that his own government wrested control of it from him in 1908. It would remain a Belgian colony until 1960.Leopold II introduced his countrymen to a colonialist tradition that would come to be known, in retrospect, as “human zoos.” These were public showings (“ethnological exhibitions” was what they were called at the time) of indigenous people plucked from their homelands, shipped across oceans, and put on display — usually in recreated “native” habitats, but also, in some cases, literally in cages — for the edification and amusement of mostly European audiences. They were very popular attractions at international expositions (world’s fairs) during the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, when smaller versions of the same could also be found in museums and traveling shows, in the United States as well as Europe, featuring so-called “primitive” peoples from many different parts of the world, including the Americas.Leopold mounted such a display on his estate in conjunction with the Brussels International Exposition of 1897. What it was like and what it revealed about the deep racism implicit in the colonialist mindset was captured in a National Public Radio feature in September 2018:Indeed, 61 years later, in 1958, the spectacle would be repeated as if nothing had been learned in the intervening half-century. Among the exhibits seen by visitors to that year’s Brussels World’s Fair (“Expo ’58”) was a reconstructed Congolese village populated with hundreds of “inhabitants” brought over from Africa.Some contemporaneous press accounts conveyed a sanguine impression of the quaint tableaux of native life presented in the Congo Pavilion. This is how it was described by an American visitor in the 30 May 1958 edition of the :But a disquieting photograph taken at the exhibition reveals a darker side. The image often appears in historical retrospectives of Expo ’58 and is frequently shared on social media as an example of colonial racism:In the photograph, white exhibition-goers are seen interacting with a black child standing alone in an enclosure marked off by crude fencing. It’s unclear from the grainy image what the precise nature of that interaction was, but the standard description is plausible: Visitors were feeding the child as one might feed an animal in a zoo.The description “human zoo” is clearly apt in a figurative sense — the human beings on display were gawked at and to some extent treated like zoo animals, but the exhibition wasn’t billed or promoted as such. The Congolese people who took part in it did so voluntarily and weren’t confined there. That they were free to go is demonstrated in what ultimately became of the Congo village display — it was abandoned.According to Zana Etambala, a Royal Museum historian interviewed by NPR, the Congolese people who played the roles of villagers in the Congo Pavilion had come to Brussels under the impression that they were participating in a “cultural exchange.” The experience proved to be anything but:An account of the Congo Pavilion in , also from 2018, noted that at a certain point the Congolese packed up and went home:Film footage and photographs of the mock village (including the now-infamous image of white tourists gawking at the Congolese child) were featured in a 60th anniversary retrospective aired by Belgium’s Flemish Radio and Television Broadcasting Organization (VRT). As noted in VRT’s online commentary, Expo ’58’s colonialist trappings apparently had the unintended consequence of accelerating the Congo’s push for independence.A backlash took place in the Belgian press against the treatment of the Congolese, as noted by historian Gonzague Pluvinage in his 2008 book :As it happened, members of the Congolese intelligentsia also attended the fair as invited guests of the Belgian government. Among them, reportedly, was a political activist named Patrice Lumumba, who, upon returning to Africa, helped found the Congolese National Movement, which immediately pressed for decolonization.“The fundamental aim of our movement is to free the Congolese people from the colonialist regime and earn them their independence,” Lumumba would say in a December 1958 speech, mere months after the Expo ended. “We base our action on the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man — rights guaranteed to each and every citizen of humanity by the United Nations Charter — and we are of the opinion that the Congo, as a human society, has the right to join the ranks of free peoples.”Led by Lumumba, who would become the nation’s first prime minister, the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared its independence from Belgium on 30 May 1960.",

        "evidence": "On July 11, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump visited wounded soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The trip made national headlines in large part because Trump was photographed walking the halls of the hospital in a face mask. Before this photo op, the president had so far been reluctant to wear a face covering in public despite the insistence of medical officials that doing so would help slow the spread of the coronavirus.\nA number of photographs were posted online showing Trump in his presidential face mask, but one image supposedly showed that Trump, at one point, was wearing his mask below his nose:\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes several times on its website that in order for a face mask to be effective it must be worn over the mouth and nose. If this image is real, it shows Trump incorrectly wearing his mask. But is this a genuine photograph? \nWe have not been able to find the source of this image. It does not appear in The Associated Press or Getty Images galleries documenting Trump’s visit to Walter Reed. This image also doesn’t appear in the 30-second video from The Associated Press showing Trump and his staff entering the hospital in masks:\nThe New York Times reported that Trump, at one point, had his mask below his nose, but they did not include the viral photograph (or any other image) to illustrate this point:\nUnfortunately, at a certain point, his nose was visible, too — a mistake that obviates the effectiveness of the mask as a protection for others, or the image of himself as a mask-wearing role model, since what he ended up modeling was how not to wear it. But it was a start!\nAlthough we can’t make any definitive statements about this image, we can say that we are skeptical of its authenticity, as a brief examination of this low quality, compressed, blurry image revealed a few apparent oddities. For instance, Trump’s nose appears more angular than normal in the viral photograph, there’s discoloration around the mask, the straps of the mask around Trump’s ears appear elongated, and the shape of the mask itself appears unusual (why is the “nose bump” still visible if the mask is no longer on Trump’s nose?). \nWe cannot definitively say if this image is real or fake because we have not been able to uncover its original source. The earliest postings of this image that we could find came from social media accounts that frequently post content critical of Trump, such as The Other 98%. We reached out to The Other 98%, as well as some other early posters, for more information about the origins of the image. We also reached out to photographers from The Associated Press and Getty Images who were in attendance at Walter Reed to see if they had any additional information about this photograph.",

        "evidence": "In December 2018, social media users shared a story on the self-publishing site auxx.me bearing the headline, “Drone Footage Reveals Over 100 Whales Trapped in Secret Underwater ‘Jails,'” with many questioning whether the report was real. Aside from the fact that the cages are hardly “secret,” the story is sadly true.The information was originally reported by the independent Russian newspaper  on 30 October 2018. The paper revealed that more than 100 whales were caged in small enclosures off Russia’s Pacific coast near the city of Nakhodka, possibly in violation of an international ban on commercial whale hunting. The account has since been picked up by reputable English-language news outlets including CBS News and the UK’s .According to news reports, 90 belugas and 11 orcas are being held in small enclosures that reporters have dubbed “whale jails” or “whale prison.” Some of the animals have been held there since July 2018 and many suspect they will be sold for entertainment in a burgeoning marine park industry in China, as  reported: “An Orca whale can reportedly fetch more than $6 million in the booming ocean theme park industry in neighbouring China. There are more than 60 marine parks in China, and at least a dozen more are under construction.”Although Russian prosecutors are investigating the capture and export of the animals by four companies, identified by  as LLC Oceanarium DV, LLC Afalina, LLC Bely Kit and LLC Sochi Dolphinarium, the fate of the animals is currently unclear. Thomas Henningsen, a marine biologist who is head of the Russia program for the international environmental activist organization Greenpeace, confirmed to us via email that as of 19 December 2018 the whales were still in the cages and that the conditions there were “disastrous and cruel.”Experts cited by  also opined that many of the whales were likely infants, based on the sheer number of them packed into pens — “even though the capture of whale calves is categorically forbidden.”News reports included an apparent cell phone video that captured the moment one of the whales was lifted by crane and placed into a tank for transport:According to the animal-oriented web site The Dodo, the process for capturing the whales is harrowing and potentially deadly due to the stress and exhaustion the animals endure:The whales’ situation has caused something of an international outcry. Thousands of people have signed a petition demanding the release of the whales.Orcas are renowned for their intelligence, capacity to feel grief, and complex social and family relationships, and their well-being has been a point of evolving controversy. With many local populations endangered or threatened in the wild, the 2013 documentary  stoked a national backlash in the United States against marine parks such as Sea World for the treatment of captive animals.The matter has reached the highest office in Russia. On 19 December 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state-operated news agency RIA Novosti that Putin was leaning on the local governor in an effort to resolve the issue.In late April 2019, the Russian government enlisted the help of French ocean explorer Jacques-Michel Cousteau of the Ocean Futures Society to help figure out how to safely release the animals in the summer. Criminal charges have been levied against the four companies that have held the whales captive.Reuters reported that as of June 2019, eight of the ten whales, two orcas and six belogas, had been released. However wildlife activists criticized the Russian government for lack of transparency and rushing the process, thus placing the animals at risk.In November 2019, Reuters reported that the release of the remaining whales had been completed, according to a statement from the Russian Research Institute for Fisheries and Oceanology.",

It’s possible this image actually shows another species of megabat, called fruit bats or old world fruit bats, such as the Large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus).We’ve reached out to Bat Conservation International for help identifying this species and will update this article when more information is available.Regardless of the exact species, this is a genuine photograph of a large megabat. It was first posted to the “Nature Is Metal” section of Reddit on 9 August 2018 along with the claim that it showed a “Flying Fox” in the Philippines, where Reddit user “sakundes” uploaded two additional images in that thread to assure skeptical viewers that the first photograph was real. One was simply an uncropped version of the viral image, and the second pictured this megabat from a different angle:We also found a video of this same flying fox on YouTube:While these images are real, they may also give viewers an unrealistic expectation about the size of megabats. We’ve encountered a few social media posts, for instance, labeling this bat as “human-sized.”The flying fox is one of the largest species of bats in the world, with a wingspan growing to nearly 5 1/2 feet. However, the megabat’s actually body length is not comparable to the size of an average adult human. According to Animal Diversity, these megabats only grow to a little over a foot in length and weigh less than 3 pounds.",

        "evidence": "Shortly after U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden named Sen. (and former California Attorney General) Kamala Harris as his running mate in August 2020, social media users began circulating a meme purportedly showing two contradictory statements Harris had made about the value of having more police on the streets, along with commentary painting Harris as a “lying hypocrite”:\n\nIn a strictly literal sense, the meme correctly attributes to Harris two contrasting statements she made 11 years apart, as The New York Times noted in an August 2020 article about Harris’ viewpoint on police misconduct:\nIn her 2009 book, “Smart on Crime,” she wrote that “if we take a show of hands of those who would like to see more police officers on the street, mine would shoot up,” adding that “virtually all law-abiding citizens feel safer when they see officers walking a beat.”\nEarlier this summer, in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, she told The New York Times that “it is status-quo thinking to believe that putting more police on the streets creates more safety. That’s wrong. It’s just wrong.”\nWhether those contrasting statements document Harris to be a “liar” or a “hypocrite” is a thornier question, however. Altering one’s viewpoint about an issue over the course of many years is not necessarily hypocritical, especially if such evolution is based on additional knowledge and experience and/or shifting conditions — it’s only hypocritical if a given viewpoint is an insincere one, expressed for purposes of political expediency rather than genuine belief. In 2009, Harris was district attorney of San Francisco, but by 2020, she had served a six-year tenure as California’s attorney general and was well into her fourth year as a U.S. senator. Certainly occurrences that took place, and the experience she accumulated, during that 11-year span might have prompted a change in her thinking.\nAs well, it’s important to note the context in which Harris made those statements. The first was taken from her 2009 book “Smart on Crime,” in a chapter that was specifically about the evolution of methods for fighting crime. The chapter was titled “Myth: The tools of crime fighting never change” and opened with the statement that “the secret of successfully reducing crime is that there is no one secret to successfully reducing crime,” so Harris was arguing against a status quo approach and emphasizing the need for measuring how effectively police were actually making communities safer (rather than merely creating the appearance of safety):\nOn one hand, if we take a show of hands of those who would like to see more police officers on the streets, mine would shoot up. A more visible and strategic police presence is a deterrent to crime, and it has a positive impact on a community. Virtually all law-abiding citizens feel safer when they see officers walking a beat. This is as true in economically poor neighborhoods as in wealthy ones. Police officers are a reassuring sign of a community’s commitment to order, calm, and safety. More beat cops means more rapid response to assaults, traffic crimes, and robberies and has a profound effect on reducing quality-of-life crimes by simple presence.\nBut in addition to putting more police on the street, we have to look at the way officers are being deployed and how we measure whether they are achieving the goal of creating a safer community.\nHer second statement came in the midst of nationwide protests spurred by the police custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020, when long-simmering issues of police violence and the treatment of Blacks by police came to a boil — all while the U.S. was grappling with a nationwide shutdown due to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. At that point, many Americans decidedly did not hold to the notion that the increased presence of police made them safer (or made them feel safer) and gave rise to “defund the police” movements. It was in that context that Harris responded to a question about police by asserting that “status quo thinking” was wrong and that “we have to reimagine what public safety looks like”:\nQ: Can I ask you about this idea of defunding the police? What’s your thinking on that idea?\nA: Well, it’s a concept. We do have to reimagine what public safety looks like. And here’s the thing. It is status quo thinking to believe that putting more police on the streets creates more safety. That’s wrong. It’s just wrong. You know what creates more safety? Funding public schools, affordable housing, increased homeownership, job skill development, jobs, access to capital for those who want to start small businesses, or who are running small businesses in communities.\nBut, no, we’re not going to get rid of the police. We all have to be practical. But let’s separate out these discussions.\nMany cities in our country spend one-third of their entire budget on policing. With all the responsibilities those cities have, one-third on policing? Put it in the context of the fact that over the last many decades, we have essentially been defunding public schools. If anyone thinks that the way we’re going to cure these problems is by putting more police on the street, they’re wrong.\nIn the period between those statements, The New York Times observed, Harris has “struggled to reconcile her calls for reform with her record as a prosecutor” — enduring criticism for not intervening in cases of controversial police shootings and for “yielding to the status quo” rather than pursuing “bold reform,” while “her approach was subtly shifting” nonetheless:\nSince becoming California’s attorney general in 2011, she had largely avoided intervening in cases involving killings by the police. Protesters in Oakland distributed fliers saying: “Tell California Attorney General Kamala Harris to prosecute killer cops! It’s her job!”\nThen, amid the national outrage stoked by the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., came pleas for her to investigate a series of police shootings in San Francisco, where she had previously been district attorney. She did not step in. Except in extraordinary circumstances, she said, it was not her job.\nStill, her approach was subtly shifting. During the inaugural address for her second term as attorney general, Ms. Harris said the nation’s police forces faced a “crisis of confidence.” And by the end of her tenure in 2016, she had proposed a modest expansion of her office’s powers to investigate police misconduct, begun reviews of two municipal police departments and backed a Justice Department investigation in San Francisco.\nCritics saw her taking baby steps when bold reform was needed — a microcosm of a career in which she developed a reputation for taking cautious, incremental action on criminal justice and, more often than not, yielding to the status quo.\nSo yes, across an 11-year span, Harris did offer the contrasting statements about police displayed above. Whether they’re evidence of hypocrisy on her part or of an authentic shift in her thinking and viewpoint is a subjective issue.",

        "evidence": "On 10 May 1991, a 14-year-old Boy Scout named David Hahn earned an Atomic Energy merit badge, the first (and likely only) person in the history of Troop 371 in Clinton Township, Michigan, to receive a badge in that discipline:Throughout his childhood, Hahn had been obsessed with chemistry, teaching himself everything he knew from encyclopedias, textbooks, and chemistry sets, while personal safety did not seem to be a concern of his. According to a 1998  profile of Hahn written by Ken Silverstein, “He once appeared at a scout meeting with a bright orange face caused by an overdose of canthaxanthin, which he was taking to test methods of artificial tanning.” In another instance, he was held responsible for a blowing a large hole in the wall of a Boy Scout tent after accidentally igniting a stockpile of powdered magnesium he had brought along. His “laboratory” was eventually moved to the potting shed behind his mother’s house, after an incident in his father’s basement that did not go as planned:After achieving the rank of Eagle Scout, Hahn decided he wanted to experiment with real radioactivity, not merely the models he had used to earn his badge. He created various radioactive devices, including two different “neutron guns” that emitted radioactive particles, and eventually decided he wanted to create a “breeder reactor” — an energy generating nuclear reactor that actually  more fissile material than it consumes (by essentially turning material around it radioactive). The concept was popular in the 1970s but for the most part has been abandoned thanks to modern technology and geologic finds that make mining uranium more cost-efficient. The breeder reactor concept was described by the Department of Energy in 1971 as follows:The obvious question is how would an adolescent working out of his mother’s potting shed acquire fissile material to play around with? This is where Hahn’s myopic focus and determination really shined: Many household products (and even more in the 1990s) contain radioactive material, but the problem is scale. Hahn exploited several commonly found products and used his knowledge of chemistry to extract and concentrate it to create radioactivity at levels “not found in nature.”Early on, one common source of Hahn’s radioactive material came from household smoke detectors, which contain extremely small amounts of the radioactive isotope americium-241 as part of the mechanism that detects smoke. He “contacted smoke-detector companies and claimed that he needed a large number of the devices for a school project.”To obtain the radioactive isotope thorium-232, Hahn recalled a fact he had learned as an Eagle Scout: that the mantle of gas lanterns contains traces of the radioactive material. So he purchased “thousands of lantern mantles from surplus stores and, using the blowtorch, reduced them into a pile of ash.” This method produced radiation levels “9,000 times the level found in nature and 170 times the level that requires [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] licensing.”Radium-226, he learned, was found in the paint of antique luminescent clocks. Hahn was able to find an antique can of the mildly radioactive paint in a clock at a nearby antique store, which he used to isolate the isotope for experiments. Tritium, he found, was used as a component of glow-in-the-dark gun and bow sights, which he repeatedly purchased and returned as part of a scheme to collect the material. Hahn “removed the tritium contained in a waxy substance inside the sights, and then, using a variety of pseudonyms, returned the sights to the store or manufacturer for repair—each time collecting another tiny quantity of tritium.”These purchases were not the only instances in which Hahn employed subterfuge to obtain radioactive material. Claiming to be a professor, he once wrote to a Czechoslovakian firm that sells uranium to commercial and university buyers, obtaining a few samples of material which contained uranium-235 and uranium-238. “Ignoring any thought of safety,” as  described it, he attempted to build a reactor using the radioactive material he had collected over the years, using a schematic in his father’s college chemistry textbook as his guide:While he never achieved the critical mass necessary for a self-sustaining reaction, Hahn certainly appeared to have accomplished the creation of some new fissile material:All of these events took place before the end of 1994, and perhaps they would have remained a secret to this day if Hahn had not stashed the remains of his nuclear reactor in that Pontiac. On 31 August 1994, police responded to complaints that Hahn was in a residential neighborhood “stealing tires from a car.” In their discussion with Hahn, the police ended up performing a search of the car and found:The discovery of the radioactive contents of Hahn’s trunk “automatically triggered the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan, and state officials soon were embroiled in tense phone consultations with the DOE, EPA, FBI, and NRC.” After examining his mother’s property (which she had cleansed of the most radioactive material in advance of law enforcement searches of the property for fear she would lose her home), authorities decided that the site was to be an EPA clean-up operation:Hahn fell into a deep depression following this episode, according to , which was likely exacerbated by his mother’s suicide in 1996. He enlisted in the armed forces and spent four years in the U.S. Navy followed by some time in the Marines Corps before returning to his home state of Michigan. In 2007 the FBI investigated claims that Hahn was storing radioactive material in his apartment. In an interview with the FBI, Hahn described his honorable discharge from the military and his struggles with paranoid schizophrenia in the years following his return home:Hahn ran into trouble with the law for stealing smoke detectors in 2007 as well, and he experienced repeated drug-related incidents in the years following. He died on 27 September 2016 at the age of 39, a death which was the result of alcohol poisoning, his father said:Hahn’s story first came to public light in the 1998  profile written by Ken Silverstein. Silverstein later expanded that piece into the book  which was in turn optioned for a feature film in 2016. “I’m proud of my son and I’m very sad that he’s gone,” Kenneth Hahn told  in March 2017. “He could have done a lot more in this world.”",

        "evidence": "Misinformation spread on the internet in the wake of a rally in Portland, Oregon, where far-right protesters clashed with counter-demonstrators — violence that has become a reoccurring feature of the political landscape in the Pacific Northwest.\nThe far-right groups, Patriot Prayer and “Him Too,” held demonstrations on June 29, 2019, in downtown Portland and were met by counter-protesters, including black-clad anti-fascists. As they have in the past, the events devolved into a series of street brawls. Three people were arrested and eight people were injured, including three who were sent to the hospital, according to police.\nRight-leaning social media personalities and websites widely circulated an image of a bearded man with blood covering his face, identifying him as John Blum and reporting that Blum was the victim of a brutal attack by “antifa criminals.” Partisan media and a single picture didn’t tell the full story, though.\nWATCH: Elderly Man Beaten With Crowbar, Another Has Head Split Open By Antifa While Trying To Help ‘Gay Man In Sundress’ https://t.co/slRy6Nzajm\n— The Daily Wire (@realDailyWire) July 1, 2019\n\nBlum was hit in the head by a black-clad protester, and that injury caused bleeding. But after a widely shared narrative that he was heroically trying to help someone emerged, so did video showing that Blum (wearing a fedora hat) was both carrying a baton and proactively engaged in a fight.\nAnother view of #JohnBlum with a #baton, choosing to charge and swing baton rather than disengage.

A black man was able to deescalate a stand off between John and #antifa & other counter protesters. #Milkshake #NoPrideforProudBoys pic.twitter.com/yomI2759Bp\n— John (@Johnnthelefty) July 2, 2019\n\nThe man who shot the videos asked us to use only his first name, John, because of harassment directed at journalists who covered the event. John told us that in the chaos that has periodically roiled Portland since the election of President Donald Trump, some people show up specifically to fight, and the late-June protests were no different. Blum had swung his baton at people before getting hit over the head himself.\n“It was just really chaotic,” John told us. “There was a point where things had calmed down, and then someone threw one more punch, and it turned into another little scuffle. That’s when the older gentleman (Blum) came at people who weren’t attacking him, I think two different people in the black bloc. Someone responded by hitting him in the head [from behind].”\nJohn, who identifies himself as an independent media worker sympathetic to the anti-fascists’ cause, said that a sundress-wearing protester was attacked, but Blum was not part of that altercation. “It’s really kind of nuanced and mixed up. The idea that John Blum was sticking up for this guy [in a sundress] is inaccurate, but there was an attempted attack on [the person in the sundress]. John Blum was not part of that confrontation.”\nHe added, “The idea that he’s some senior-citizen guy — yeah he’s obviously older, but that guy got around. He had no problem getting down. He didn’t look like he was super-fit, but he definitely had no problem trying to take on younger people.”\nThe Twitter account that originally shared a video purporting to show Blum being beaten has been suspended by the platform, though we are unsure why. We were also unable to locate Blum online for comment. \nThe misleading victim framework that spread across the right-leaning media ecosystem is no surprise, said Stanislav Vysotsky, an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater who has been researching political violence in Portland. Citing the work of sociologist Mitch Berbrier, Vysotsky told us the “victim” narrative is an established framing technique used on the far right.\n“There is already a master narrative on the far right that they are victims, victims of people of color, of Jewish conspiracies, feminists, all these things, so it’s very easy once you have this framework to paint yourself as a victim of left-wing thugs,” he told us.\nReality is more complicated, however. He places the most significant starting point for political violence in Portland with a June 4, 2017, “free speech” rally planned by right-wing Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson one week after two men were fatally stabbed on a Portland train by a white supremacist. The men had been trying to intervene as that white supremacist, identified as Jeremy Christian, berated two Muslim passengers. The rally was scheduled despite the revelation that Christian had attended a Patriot Prayer event, raising tensions.\nSince then, multiple incidents have contributed to an overall escalation of violence at various events staged by far-right activists, which draw opposition from counter-demonstrators, including anti-fascists. On May 1, 2019, members of the Patriot Prayer group showed up at Cider Riot, a bar in Portland known to have left-leaning activists as patrons, and sprayed customers with mace, initiating a street fight. One member of Gibson’s group hit a woman with a baton, fracturing a vertebrae, according a lawsuit filed by the bar.\nAlso in 2017, Vysotsky said, the far-right adopted a new tactic of holding political events in liberal strongholds like Seattle and Portland to deliberately provoke a response. “That was a shift in the politics of the far right, and this influence of the alt-right and the trolling culture. The protests became increasingly trolling events, where they are coming into the liberal territory basically saying, ‘We’re far right, and we’re coming into your city, what are you gonna do about it?'”\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, “Both Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys espouse virulently anti-Muslim views, are vocally pro-Trump, and are known for their deliberate provocations of left-leaning West Coast communities.”",

Sports and The Root, the latter of which carried the headline “Nike donates millions to Republicans while making billions from Kaepernick endorsement.”Taken as a whole, Nike’s political action committee (Nike Inc. Federal PAC), as well as individuals listed as employees of Nike, contributed $547,107 in campaign donations during the 2017-18 election cycle, up through 31 August 2018.Of that total, 78 percent ($424,600) went to Republicans and 22 percent ($122,449) went to Democrats. On this basis, the Center for Responsive Politics wrote that “Nike gave 78 percent of political contributions to Republicans this cycle.”If you take “Nike” to constitute Nike Incorporated, the company itself, then this isn’t accurate. Those donations came not from the company, but rather from its political action committee and individuals listed as employees, the latter of whom — like employees of any company — are constitutionally entitled to make whatever political donations they wish.However, this is not a mere error on the part of the Center for Responsive Politics, but rather part of their broader policy on how to categorize campaign contributions associated with particular industries and businesses.In an explanation of their methodology, the Center for Responsive Politics stated that “The organizations themselves did not donate, rather the money came from the organizations’ PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals’ immediate families.”The Center for Responsive Politics explains this broad categorization in another section of their web site:So, the Center for Responsive Politics has a note elsewhere on their web site which makes it clear that when they say “Nike gave 78 percent of political contributions to Republicans this cycle,” they actually mean, in effect: “Nike’s political action committee and company employees gave 78 percent of political contributions to Republicans this cycle.” And the group has explained its reasons for this categorization.However, the nature of this re-definition, and the nuances involved in it, were not as clearly outlined in some news articles as they were by the Center for Responsive Politics itself.Furthermore, the inclusion of contributions by Phil Knight, the billionaire co-founder of Nike and a prolific Republican donor, significantly skewed the partisan breakdown of campaign donations by individuals who listed their employer as Nike.According to Federal Election Commission records, during the 2017-18 federal election cycle Knight contributed exclusively to Republican campaign committees and candidates, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan (before his decision not to seek re-election), Oregon Congressman Greg Walden, and Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, contributions made by Knight and his wife Penelope made up almost half the total donations from Nike employees and the Nike PAC.It is arguable that Knight and his wife’s donations should not be included at all, on the grounds that Knight is not a Nike employee. In a statement, a company spokesperson confirmed to us that Knight had retired as a Nike employee in 2006, adding: “Contributions from the Nike PAC are entirely separate from personal contributions made by individuals, including Mr. Knight.”Knight is listed as an employee of Nike in Federal Election Commission records, but he no longer has an active role in the company, serving instead as a non-voting Chairman Emeritus of Nike’s Board of Directors. It’s not clear why Knight still listed Nike as his employer in 2017 and 2018.As for the company’s political action committee (as opposed to Nike’s employees), its contributions were much more evenly split between the two main parties. In a statement, a Nike spokesperson told us:According to our own analysis of Federal Election Commission data (as of 26 September 2018), the Nike Inc. Federal PAC had donated $79,500 to the campaign committees of Democratic candidates and $64,000 to the campaign committees of Republicans, a ratio similar to that claimed by Nike itself.However, when we add the donations made by Nike’s PAC to other political action committees as well as to campaign committees, the ratio flips, with Nike’s PAC donating $104,000 to Republican PACs and candidates and $96,500 to Democratic PACs and candidates.Either way, the partisan split in federal campaign donations by Nike’s PAC has been fairly close to 50/50 during the 2018 election cycle.It’s true that during the 2018 federal election cycle, donors who listed Nike as their employer did contribute vastly more to Republican candidates than to Democrats. However, that does not mean that Nike, as a company, made these contributions.Furthermore, these figures are significantly skewed by the inclusion of donations made by the company’s co-founder Phil Knight, who is no longer an employee of Nike.Finally, Nike’s political action committee, as opposed to the company’s individual employees, spent roughly the same on Democratic and Republican candidates, up to August 2018.",
        "claim": "Nike donated three times more to Republicans than Democrats during the 2018 federal election cycle, up to August 2018.",
        "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."

        "evidence": "Officials in Jefferson County, Georgia, faced allegations of racially-motivated voter suppression in October 2018 in response to an incident in which a voter registration group was ordered to return a group of African-American seniors to a county-run senior center, after those seniors boarded a bus to cast ballots during early voting for the November elections.The liberal web site ThinkProgress reported of the incident that:In a Facebook video about the incident, which took place on 15 October, the group’s co-founders LaTosha Brown and Cliff Albright characterized the county’s decision as racially-motivated voter suppression, with Albright saying:Jefferson County Democrats Chair Diane Evans was on the bus in question and helped organize the visit to the senior center in the first place, as revealed in email correspondence published by Augusta television station WJBF.Furthermore, Brett said he had not “vetted” Black Voters Matter, and that allowing the senior citizens to leave with an unfamiliar outside group could have been a “liability” for the county, which operates the senior center in Louisville and also organizes its own chartered buses for seniors to get to polling stations.In a statement sent to us, Brett wrote:In an email, Albright rejected Brett’s “liability” argument, calling it “paternalistic” and pointing out that the Louisville senior center is an activities center, not a residential center:We asked Brett what the legal basis was for his order (carried out by staff at the senior center) not to “allow” the seniors to travel to the polling station with Black Voters Matter and requested that he clarify Jefferson County’s legal authority and liabilities relating to people who use the senior center. We did not receive a response to those questions.Albright told us that staff at the senior center had given advance permission for Black Voters Matter to visit the center and hold an event there, but not for them to escort seniors to polling stations. However, he maintained this was because the group had not initially planned to take the bus trip, which he said the seniors themselves had asked for, spontaneously:Albright also questioned the sincerity of Brett’s invocation of county policy on “political activities,” pointing out that Jody Hice, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives, is scheduled to host an event at the senior center on 27 October. (Albright emphasized that he thought the event in question was very worthy and should be allowed to take place at the center, but he saw it as an example of a double standard.)In fact, on the same day that the seniors were prevented from travelling with Black Voters Matter to a polling station, the Jefferson County Board of Commissioners actually promoted Congressman Hice’s event at the senior center on their Facebook page, in a post that was taken word-for-word from Hice’s earlier press release:We asked Brett to explain why the county had forbidden an event in which a bus carrying a local Democratic party official — but no elected politician or candidate — was to escort seniors to a polling station  the center itself, but allowed a sitting Republican Congressman, who is actively campaigning for re-election, to host an event  the center itself. We also asked why the Board of Commissioners had promoted that event. We did not receive a response to those questions.In a separate Facebook post, the Board of Commissioners explained that the bus trip had been forbidden because it “was led by the President of the Jefferson County Democratic Party [Diane Evans] and as such was considered a political event.” However, the Black Voters Matter’s visit had been organized with the assistance of Evans, and yet it was still allowed to take place.We asked Brett why the Black Voters Matter visit was allowed to go ahead despite the involvement of Evans, but the bus trip was not, and asked whether he had considered requesting that Evans disembark the bus (given that her involvement was purportedly the source of the county’s objections) rather than ordering the seniors to return to the center. Again, we did not receive a response to these questions.It is true that on 15 October 2018, staff at the Jefferson County senior center in Louisville enacted the instructions of County Administrator Adam Brett by insisting that a group of seniors return to the center after they voluntarily boarded a bus operated on behalf of Black Voters Matter, a voter registration group.The leaders of that group characterized the incident as racially-motivated voter suppression, but Brett insisted otherwise, stating that the reasons for his order were twofold: the involvement of Jefferson County Democrats Chair Diane Evans meant that the bus trip constituted “political activity,” something the county could not allow, and county officials had not vetted Black Voters Matter or the bus operator, creating a potential liability for the county which Brett was unwilling to assume.However, it must be acknowledged that significant problems exist with the coherence of the twofold rationale outlined by Brett. First, it is not clear that Jefferson County actually has any legal liability for anything that happens to those who use the center once they have left the center. Likewise, it’s not clear that Brett had any legal authority to “not allow” seniors to travel to the polling station or Black Voters Matter to escort them there.Second, the consistency with which Jefferson County enforces their prohibition on “political activities” at the senior center is questionable. On the one hand, Brett forbade the bus trip to the polling station on this basis due to the involvement of a local Democratic official, even though the bus trip would have taken the seniors  from the senior center, and even though the county allowed a visit to the senior center which had been organized with the help of that same Democratic official.But Jefferson County’s Board of Commissioners also sanctioned a forthcoming event to be hosted by Jody Hice, a sitting Republican Congressman and active election candidate, which is scheduled to take place in the center itself, and the Board of Commissioners has promoted that event on Facebook in a post taken word-for-word from Hice’s earlier press release.",

        "evidence": "Authorities say a 13-year-old Alabama girl with special needs was beheaded after she saw her grandmother killed in a cemetery.Huntsville television station WAFF reported the details of a grisly crime which emerged at a preliminary hearing in a Madison County court for 26-year-old Yoni Aguilar, who, along with 34-year-old Israel Palomino, is charged with two counts of capital murder in the June 2018 slayings of 49-year-old Oralia Mendoza and her granddaughter, Mariah Lopez.According to court testimony, in the days before the murder Aguilar, Palomino, Mendoza, and Mendoza’s friend Laticia Garcia went to Georgia to pick up a large amount of drugs, and something that took place during the trip prompted Palomino and Mendoza to engage in an ultimately fatal argument. Aguilar and Palomino eventually drove the victims to a cemetery, where Mendoza was fatally stabbed:The suspects reportedly killed 13-year-old Mariah because she was a witness to the slaying of her grandmother, taking her to a secluded area where, Aguilar claimed, Palomino forced him to kill the girl:The disreputable web site Your News Wire published an article on this subject headlined “Illegal Immigrant Beheads 13-Year-Old Girl in Alabama — Media Blackout,” which asserted that “the mainstream media has failed to report on the barbaric crime” because “mainstream media outlets are now choosing to suppress horrific news stories involving illegal immigrants.”However, the underlying crimes were in fact widely reported by multiple national U.S. news outlets, including Fox News, the , the Associated Press, and Cox Media Group.Moreover, according to Huntsville station WAAY, while Aguilar was an undocumented immigrant, Palomino was legally in the U.S. on a green card. Since it’s as yet unclear what involvement each of the two men had in Mariah Lopez’s death, it cannot be definitively stated at this time that an “illegal immigrant beheaded a 13-year-old.”",

        "evidence": "In mid-May 2019, concerned readers inquired about the accuracy of a blog post, spread widely on social media at the time, claiming that the nation of Canada had been placed under a “boil water” notice after the discovery of E.coli in the water supply.The 16 April post on the website “Canada Eh?” bore the headline, “Canada Is Under a Boil Water Advisory After Dangerous E.coli Bacteria Found in the Water” and went on to report that:“Montreal, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan tests water on a regular basis to evaluate the quality of the water that the residents use to cook, clean, and drink. Inspectors made the discovery on Saturday following a routine test. E. coli can cause infections that result in nausea, vomiting, headache, mild fever, severe stomach cramps, and watery or bloody diarrhea. Though many recover from E.coli infections on their own, some infections result in hospitalizations. This advisory affects 20,900 households, or around 25,700 people.”Elements of the blog post were plagiarized from a 2 April article on the “MTL Blog” website, which notified readers about a genuine boil-water notice that affected only part of the city of Montreal and not the entire country of Canada. That advisory was based on the detection of the E.coli bacterium in part of the water supply, but the issue was resolved after four days.The “Canada Eh?” website published an almost identical blog post on 2 April which also plagiarized from MTL Blog’s report about Montreal, but on that occasion falsely claimed that the city of Toronto had been placed under a water notice due to the discovery of E.coli in their water supply.“Canada Eh?” appears to have a pattern of periodically re-purposing and re-publishing the template of an article about an E.coli-related boil-water notice in an effort to garner shares on social media.A boil-water notice is a type of drinking water advisory issued by governments when tests have shown that the water supply in a specific area contains disease-carrying viruses or bacteria, such as E.coli (Escherichia coli), which can cause food poisoning.According to Indigenous Services Canada, the national government department with responsibility for water advisories, consumers under a boil-water notice are advised to boil their tap water for at least one minute before drinking it or using it to cook, wash food, brush their teeth, or prepare infant formula.Indigenous Services Canada keeps a frequently updated tracker of any localized, short-term water advisories across the country. According to that data, there was no nationwide, short-term boil water notice in effect on 17 May 2019 or in mid-April, at the time “Canada Eh?” published their article.According to a similar official tracker of  drinking water advisories, there was also no nationwide long-term boil water notice in effect on 17 May 2019, or at the time “Canada Eh?” published their report on 16 April.As such, the article’s core claim is false and appears to be no more than a cynical effort to manipulate the public’s concern about water safety in order to gain shares on social media. Genuine drinking-water advisories are periodically put in place across Canada, just as they are in many other countries, but concerned residents should consult official government sources for information about their local areas.",

        "evidence": "During the Democratic presidential debates on June 27, 2019, U.S. senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) got into a heated discussion about race with fellow 2020 candidate and former vice president Joe Biden.\nHarris confronted Biden over remarks he had made about having “civil” working relationships with segregationist lawmakers James O. Eastland and Hermand Talmadge. “It was hurtful,” said Harris, who is the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, “to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and careers on the segregation of race in this country.”\nHarris continued by criticizing Biden for working with those lawmakers “to oppose busing” to desegregate schools. She then segued into a personal story about being a “little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools. And she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me”:\n\n\n       Rumble(\\\"play\\\", {\\\"video\\\": \\\"v594zn\\\",\\\"div\\\": \\\"rumble_v594zn\\\",\\\"autoplay\\\":2});\n\nThose comments by Harris attracted the attention of junk news and conspiracy sites such as Gateway Pundit, which republished an article of theirs from a nearly a year earlier asserting that Harris had “lied” about being among the early groups of students who integrated Berkeley schools. \n“Kamala lied,” Gateway Pundit declared. “Actually the classrooms in Berkeley were already integrated in 1963 — before she was born. Here’s a photo from the 1963 Berkeley yearbook. And here’s a photo from the Berkeley 1964 yearbook — the year Kamala was born.”  \nThose photographs did document that black students comprised a significant proportion of a Berkeley public school’s student body as early as 1963:\n\n\nBut the yearbook images posted by Gateway Pundit were from Berkeley High School, not from the area’s lower grade-level schools. And that was a key detail.\nHarris was born in 1964, and Berkeley Public Schools didn’t fully integrate until 1968, meaning Harris was still a grade school-aged child when the district was in its early years of ending “de facto segregation” by using buses to transport children, according to contemporaneous news reports. Harris entered the Berkeley public school system in 1969, when she began taking a bus to Thousand Oaks Elementary School in an affluent, predominantly white area.\nIt was misleading of Gateway Pundit to offer images of Berkeley High School’s yearbooks in the early 1960s as evidence that Harris was allegedly lying about her role in education desegregation, because Berkeley High was (and is) the only public high school in the city, so it was integrated by necessity. But most of the district’s local elementary schools were not integrated back then.\n“[Berkeley High] was the only high school, that’s where all the kids in the city would go,” district spokesman Charless Burress told the Associated Press. He confirmed that 14 of the district’s elementary schools weren’t integrated until the beginning of the 1968 school year. Thus if Harris entered the public school system in 1969, she would have indeed been part of the second class of students in a newly integrated district.\nAccording to data published by the school district, in 1963 “Negro” students comprised only 2.5% percent of the student body at Thousand Oaks Elementary School, while “Caucasian” students comprised 95.1% of the student body.  Due to the district’s integration efforts, by 1969 those figures had shifted to 40.2% and 53.4%, respectively. ",

        "evidence": "In August 2020, less than three months before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, photographs surfaced on social media supposedly showing several U.S. Postal Service mailboxes locked up to block voters from sending mail-in ballots.\nSome posters suggested padlocks and heavy red bars on mailboxes in several U.S. cities were part of a nefarious scheme by newly appointed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy — a political ally to U.S. President Donald Trump — to make it harder for Americans to vote in the presidential election between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Nov. 3, 2020.\n\nThe claim surfaced weeks after DeJoy issued new guidelines for Postal Service mail carriers and clerks — directives that he framed as solutions to the agency’s long-standing financial issues. Workers were instructed to leave some letters or packages at distribution centers longer than usual and informed them that management would no longer pay carriers overtime to complete all mail deliveries.\nMeanwhile, Postal Service employees and customers reported delays in deliveries. And critics of Trump accused DeJoy of making the changes to intentionally slow the mail, which, as a result, could force elections officials to invalidate mail-in ballots not returned by predetermined deadlines — and potentially increase Trump’s chances of winning another presidential term (claims we could neither prove nor disprove in a previous investigation here).\nResponding to that criticism, DeJoy on Aug. 18, 2020, announced he would temporarily suspend the new initiatives “that have been raised as areas of concern,” including the controversial July 2020 directives that eliminated overtime and some delivery trips.\nDespite DeJoy’s reversal, social media users continued circulating photographs that supposedly showed Postal Service mailboxes being removed from neighborhoods (we explore that claim here), as well as pictures of mailboxes with the red locks — all evidence, they believed, of an alleged conspiracy to undermine voters’ abilities to participate in the 2020 election and simultaneously avoid potential exposure to the COVID-19 disease at in-person polling places.\nMany social media users posted about locked mailboxes as though they had not seen them prior to summer 2020, adding proof, they alleged, of the devices’ role in stopping people from casting mail-in ballots before the presidential election. Rex Chapman, a former NBA player and outspoken Democrat, said on Twitter:\n\nTo investigate the underlying claim — that the Postal Service deliberately placed locks on mailboxes in summer 2020 to stop voters from casting mail-in ballots — we first searched for evidence of such locks on mailboxes anywhere in the country prior to summer 2020. That proof would challenge the theory that the devices were only tied to a scheme by Postal Service leadership to undermine the 2020 presidential election.\nSnopes found an April 23, 2016, story by Los Angeles Daily News that included a photograph of two mailboxes with padlocks and red bars to prevent people from using or getting inside the boxes. The setup matched what was depicted in some of the viral postings in summer 2020.\nRichard Maher, a spokesman for Post Office operations in Los Angeles and Orange counties at the time, told the newspaper that the agency had retrofitted boxes across Southern California so carriers could install the locks during their last pickup of the day and then remove the devices the following morning. The locks, he said, were designed to stop people from illegally stealing other people’s mail from inside the mail boxes. He said: “We do this where we have had incidents, or there is a problem where the box may be out in a not very well lit public place.”\nAnother story — a July 5, 2018, article by The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, a newspaper for the New York City borough — also included a photograph of a mailbox with a padlock, red bar, and sign reading: “THIS COLLECTION BOX HAS BEEN LOCKED. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO OPEN OR USE.” The article reported:\nPostal officials had placed locks on every USPS mailbox in the neighborhood — that’s dozens — on Wednesday afternoon to prevent someone from setting off a bomb in one of them during the July 4 Independence Day fireworks display. […] A USPS spokesperson told the Brooklyn Eagle that the locks were installed ‘in the interest of safety and security.’\nBased on those reports, we deemed it false to assert that the locks were only part of some alleged scheme on behalf of Postal Service leadership to disenfranchise voters in the 2020 presidential election.\nNext, to fully investigate the claim that, even though the locks were not new, several devices were installed to prevent voters from casting mail-in ballots in 2020, we pinpointed where exactly people were reporting new locks to prevent mail-in voting. Social media posts that showed locked mailboxes in Burbank, California (a city in Los Angeles), Southfield, Michigan (a Detroit suburb), and Seattle, Washington, appeared to be the most widely shared or reported sources of the rumor alleging election interference.\nOn Aug. 19, 2020, we asked Ernie Swanson, a Postal Service spokesperson, about those posts specifically, and the overarching allegation that the agency purposefully installed locks on several mailboxes to suppress the vote. He responded with an email that read:\nMail collection boxes have locks placed on them usually because of acts of vandalism which result in the box no longer being secure. The locks have been in use for many years. The box is removed and repaired, if possible. The removed box is replaced with another box. I don’t know how many boxes get removed for this reason in the U.S.\nIn other words, he confirmed the agency had used the locks for years prior to 2020 as security tools. However, he did not comment on the validity of specific reports in Burbank, Southfield, and Seattle, nor explain for what reasons, exactly, those locks were installed. He also did not explain whether the agency had increased its use of the locks in 2020, which could result in some Americans seeing them for the first time in their neighborhoods.\nHowever, it’s also worth noting that one Burbank resident tweeted: “This Burbank post office has been locking up its mail boxes on Sundays/after hours for MONTHS because of theft. This is NOT an election thing.”\n\nResponding to Chapman’s tweet, specifically, another Burbank resident posted, too: “This is my post office. These mailboxes are open on the other side, you just have to get out of your car to mail them. It’s been this way for months. This isn’t part of the purge.”\nIn sum, given the fact that the locks had been used prior to 2020 as security tools unrelated to electoral politics, the complete absence of evidence to prove Postal Service leadership had deliberately installed the devices to prevent people from casting mail-in ballots — as well as the lack of proof to confirm or deny whether the agency had upped its usage of the devices in 2020 — we rate this claim “Mostly False.”\nHowever, regardless of whether you’re seeing locked mailboxes in your neighborhood, it’s important to note here: The Postal Service has not met its goals for limiting delays of first-class mail (which is how completed mail-in ballots are categorized) in five years, according to the Postal Regulatory Commission. In 2019, for example, the agency delivered only about 81% of its three- to five-day, single-piece, first-class mailings on time — when its goal was roughly 95%, per a June 2020 report by the commission. That said, Thomas J. Marshall, the general counsel for the Postal Service, said in a May 29, 2020, letter about the anticipated surge in mail-in voting due to the pandemic:\n“The Postal Service cannot guarantee a specific delivery date or alter standards to comport with individual state election laws. To account for delivery standards and to allow for contingencies (e.g., weather issues or unforeseen events), voters should mail their return ballots at least 1 week prior to the due date established by state law.”",

        "evidence": "In the summer of 2020, readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of online articles reporting that Rutgers University in New Jersey had “declared grammar racist.” \nOn July 24, the Washington Free Beacon posted an article with the headline “Rutgers Declares Grammar Racist.” The article reported:\n“The English department at a public university declared that proper English grammar is racist. Rutgers University’s English department will change its standards of English instruction in an effort to ‘stand with and respond’ to the Black Lives Matter movement. In an email written by department chair Rebecca Walkowitz, the Graduate Writing Program will emphasize ‘social justice’ and ‘critical grammar.'”\nSeveral other websites and blogs posted articles that claimed that Rutgers had declared grammar, or “proper grammar,” racist. Some placed quotation marks around the word “racist” in their headlines and articles, indicating that that description had originated in something written or uttered by the university or its faculty.\nThose reports were false. Neither Rutgers, nor its English department, nor that department’s chair, Walkowitz, described grammar, “proper grammar,” or the teaching or use of grammar as “racist.” Nor did they imply it was racist or use words to that effect. \nThe controversy originated in a June 19 open letter published on the website of Rutgers’ English department and signed by Walkowitz. The lengthy and detailed post outlined the measures being taken by the department in order to “stand with and respond to the Black Lives Matter movement; to create and promote an anti-racist environment in our workplace, our classes, our department, our university, and our communities; and to contribute to the eradication of the violence and systemic inequities facing black, indigenous, and people of color members of our community, to which the #BLM movement and ongoing protests have drawn our attention in pointed and necessary ways.”\nIn one of dozens of sections, Walkowitz wrote that the English department’s Graduate Writing Program would be undertaking three initiatives. One of those was “Incorporating ‘critical grammar’ into our pedagogy.” On that, Walkowitz wrote:\n“This approach challenges the familiar dogma that writing instruction should limit emphasis on grammar/sentence-level issues so as to not put students from multilingual, non-standard ‘academic’ English backgrounds at a disadvantage. Instead, it encourages students to develop a critical awareness of the variety of choices available to them [with] regard to micro-level issues in order to empower them and equip them to push against biases based on ‘written’ accents.”\nNowhere did the letter describe grammar as “racist.” Online posts that placed quotation marks around that word therefore misled readers by presenting it as a direct quotation. Walkowitz’s letter also did not include statements that could fairly or reasonably be summarized as “declaring grammar racist.”\nContrary to Leonydus Johnson’s claim in the Washington Free Beacon, the letter also did not “[make] the racist assumption that minorities cannot comprehend traditional English.” Johnson also falsely claimed that Walkowitz’s letter endorsed or articulated “the idea that expecting a student to write in grammatically correct sentences is indicative of racial bias.” It did not do that. \nNeither did the English department propose to “alter grammar rules for nonwhite students,” as the Washington Examiner falsely claimed. \nIn fact, Walkowitz’s letter explicitly stipulated that the “critical grammar” initiative ran counter to what she called “the familiar dogma that writing instruction should limit emphasis on grammar/sentence-level issues so as to not put students from multilingual, non-standard ‘academic’ English backgrounds at a disadvantage.” \nWalkowitz told Hank Kalet, a lecturer in the Communications department at Rutgers and the author of a blog post about the controversy, that the department’s plan would actually result in “more attention to grammar in the aggregate, not less.” She added that, “Our standards remain rigorous and high, and our goal is to help students succeed in academic writing and other writing genres.”\nKalet provided a good summary of the error made by those who rushed to claim that Walkowitz’s letter had “declared grammar racist.” Of the key paragraph in the letter, he wrote:\nThis passage should be clear to anyone who takes the time to read what is written. The “familiar dogma” here is the problem. It assumes that students from multilingual backgrounds will be harmed by a focus on grammar at the expense of broader writing issues. This dogma can leave students without the strong, sentence-level foundation they need to write well.\nWhat Rutgers is proposing — and what the letter clearly says — is a shift; it is not proposing to de-emphasize grammar, but to encourage “critical awareness,” or an understanding of the history and development of English grammar, how it works, and the potential impacts of the choices made in the writing process. Rather than lowering the bar, as the critics claim, the department is raising it.",

During the event, Harris said she would give Congress 100 days to act on gun control before taking executive action:However, Harris never said the order would result in the forcible confiscation of citizen-owned guns. In fact, Harris made a point to say that this would not be the case. As she explained her position on gun control, she noted that Americans are typically given a “false choice” between protecting the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and confiscating all guns. Harris said the public needs middle-ground options, and that her proposal constituted a “reasonable” approach to gun control.Here’s Harris’ full statement from CNN’s transcript of the event:In summary, Harris did say she would take executive action on gun control if Congress failed to act within 100 days of her taking office as president. Her proposed executive order would include gun-control measures such as implementing universal background checks and renewing the ban on assault weapons. But the viral quote about an executive order to confiscate guns appears to be an inaccurate paraphrase of the Democratic candidate’s statement on the matter.",

Trump was responding to a reporter who asked how long the president expected to take hydroxychloroquine, a drug that Trump has been promoting as a potential treatment for COVID-19 without medical evidence for its safety or efficacy.\nHere is a transcription of the exchange between the reporter and Trump, per WhiteHouse.gov:\nQ Sir, how long do you expect take hydroxychloroquine?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think it’s another day. I had a two-week regimen of hydroxychloroquine. And I’ve taken it, I think, just about two weeks. I think it’s another day. And I’m still here. I’m still here.

        "evidence": "As the number of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease surpassed 2 million in early June 2020, the campaign to reelect U.S. President Donald Trump ended its monthslong pause on large, in-person events and announced it would host a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the coming weeks.\nDespite public health officials‘ recommendations at the time to avoid group gatherings and crowds to limit the spread of COVID-19, the Trump campaign announced on June 10 that it would host a rally at the Bank of Oklahoma Center, which seats almost 19,200 people, on June 19. Trump told reporters at the White House:\nWe’re going to start our rallies back up now. We’ve had a tremendous run at rallies. …The first one, we believe, will be probably — we’re just starting to call up — will be in Oklahoma — in Tulsa, Oklahoma. A beautiful, new venue — brand-new. And we’re looking forward to it. They’ve done a great job with COVID, as you know, in the state of Oklahoma.\nBeyond the event’s potential threat to attendees’ health, critics including high-profile Democrats and historians saw the announcement as a call to white supremacists during a national reckoning over racism following the death of George Floyd for two reasons: Tulsa is home to one of the worst acts of racial violence in American history — the 1921 Tulsa race massacre — and the event’s originally scheduled date of June 19, or Juneteenth, is a day in many communities that traditionally celebrates the end of U.S. slavery in 1865. So two days after the initial announcement from the Trump campaign, the president yielded to that backlash and said he would delay the event and instead hold it on June 20. He tweeted:\n\nBut as critics pointed out, the massive gathering still held the potential to expose large numbers of people to COVID-19. As if to confirm the danger, reports appeared saying the Trump campaign was asking attendees to agree in advance not to hold the campaign liable for coronavirus exposure:\n\nTo investigate the claim that attendees were asked to agree to a liability waiver, we went through the steps of reserving a spot at the Tulsa rally in the days before the event. To receive a digital ticket for the event, attendees had to complete the following form:\n\nAt the bottom of the registration page, the following text appeared:\nBy clicking register below, you are acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present. By attending the Rally, you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.; BOK Center; ASM Global; or any of their affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, or volunteers liable for any illness or injury.\nIn other words, to reserve an entry ticket for the Tulsa rally, people had to agree that they would “assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19” and agree not to sue Trump or any organizers of the event if they got sick. That agreement essentially clears the campaign of any responsibility should attendees catch the virus.\nAt first, campaign leaders declined to elaborate on their plans to protect attendees’ health once they were at the event. Then, on June 14, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters that attendees should wear masks. And campaign manager Brad Parscale said the following day that event organizers will hand out hand sanitizer and face masks (though they’re not necessarily required) and check attendees’ temperatures for fevers. He tweeted:\n\nStill unclear is if, or to what extent, the event will promote social distancing. It’s possible people will stand or sit less than six feet apart from each other, despite recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to avoid that close of contact with people to prevent the virus’ spread. Additionally, as of June 16, the CDC urged everyone to wear cloth face coverings when they leave their homes, stating on its website:\nConsidering the ongoing health risks due to COVID-19 and an upward trend in cases statewide, Tulsa Health Department Director Bruce Dart said he would rather the president hold the event at a later date. He told Tulsa World:\nI think it’s an honor for Tulsa to have a sitting president want to come and visit our community, but not during a pandemic. …I’m concerned about our ability to protect anyone who attends a large, indoor event, and I’m also concerned about our ability to ensure the president stays safe as well.\nAs of June 15, Oklahoma had tallied 359 deaths and 3,417 non-fatal cases due to the virus.\nThe Trump campaign had last held a big rally on March 2 in Charlotte, North Carolina, before much of the country shut down to curb the pandemic.\nIn sum, given the substantiating evidence that, in order to receive a ticket for the Tulsa event, people must click a box agreeing they would not hold the Trump campaign or event organizers liable should they catch COVID-19 at the June 20, 2020, rally, we rate this claim “True”.",

We found just two comments critical of Donald Trump and arguably insensitive to Pollack’s grief, but not one personal attack directly addressed to Pollack himself. On the contrary, Facebook users posted hundreds of messages expressing sympathy, condolences, solidarity and support towards Pollack and his family. As is often the case with social networking controversies and disputes, the outraged response to an offense (the public slating of Andrew Pollack for his political beliefs) has been vastly greater than the scale of the offense itself. Pollack and members of his family visited the White House on 21 February 2018, to take part in a “listening session” hosted by President Trump. Pollack delivered powerful remarks, at times directly addressing Trump, saying “I’m very angry that this happened, because it keeps happening.”",

        "evidence": "An old story about Edith Piaf got a new lease of life in October 2017, when a web site devoted to “positive and meaningful content” produced a short video recounting the iconic French singer’s purported heroism during World War Two. On 17 October, Fabiosa Australia posted an animated video to its Facebook page, telling the following story:Neither the video nor the accompanying Facebook post provides any source, but this is an old tale that has been modified and embellished over the decades. According to one source, Piaf saved “thousands” of Jews (not 120) from the Nazi camps, and in another iteration it was the prisoners themselves who made their own fake IDs.According to Carolyn Burke’s 2011 biography of Piaf, she used a seven-week tour of prisoner-of-war camps in Germany as a way to help carry out a mission for her secretary Andrée “Dédée” Bigard, who was part of the anti-Nazi Resistance movement:Shortly after her return home from Germany, according to Burke, Piaf was “already planning her next trip there”:According to later interviews given by Bigard, Piaf visited 11 stalags on that trip to Germany and— in Burke’s words — distributed “identity cards, maps and compasses. Sometimes the escaped prisoners caught up with her tour and were passed off as musicians.” The mission was ended when officials at one of the camps became suspicious. In French journalist Robert Belleret’s biography , Andrée Bigard is quoted as saying that the singer had been part of a “Resistance network”:After the liberation of France by the Allies, and the end of World War Two, France underwent what was known as the “Épuration Sauvage” (the “Wild Purge”) — essentially a period of informal and often brutal revenge against those who had aided the Nazis in their annexation of France.According to the political scientist Michael Curtis, between 9,000 and 10,000 suspected collaborationists were killed. After this, official tribunals were set up and a period known as the “Épuration Legale” (the “Legal Purge”) ensued. Tens of thousands of people were jailed, 6,763 were sentenced to death, and 768 of these were executed. Edith Piaf was believed by some to have been a collaborator, due to her tours of prisoner-of-war camps and participation in Nazi propaganda efforts, and she was called to testify before a tribunal with a focus on French artists.According to Carolyn Burke, the tribunal had included her name in a list of musicians whose voice was to be banned from French radio, something that would have been a significant blow to her career. However, she testified that her first trip to Germany was made under coercion, and the second one was undertaken for the true purpose of giving prisoners money and helping them escape.Andrée Bigard backed up Piaf’s account, and the singer was cleared. Shortly after her testimony in October 1944, she gave an interview to the Ce Soir newspaper, in which she provided the now famous number of 118 soldiers having been saved by her actions, and remarked: However, Robert Belleret casts doubt on this version of events, pointing out implausibilities and inconsistencies in the account  and suggesting that the story might have been concocted so as to justify Piaf’s visits to Germany (which were intended and used by the Nazis as propaganda in Vichy France), and to save herself from the wrath of the tribunals: Belleret lists some of the purported details of Piaf’s efforts to help Jewish people (sending them money and housing them) during the Nazi occupation, but notes that these names and numbers were provided by Piaf herself and her loyal secretary Andrée Bigard, and that they could not be verified. Carolyn Burke’s biography, which casts a less skeptical and more positive light on Edith Piaf, also does not contain corroborating evidence (that is, evidence provided by someone other than Piaf or Bigard). It is possible that such evidence exists, or once existed but has been lost, or that the individuals who could prove that Edith Piaf helped them escape are no longer alive. But without such testimony, establishing the veracity of this famous old story remains elusive. ",

        "evidence": "The political skirmishing over how to address the problem of gun violence in the United States took a new turn in March 2018, with the publication of reports by right-leaning media outlets accusing President Obama of undermining the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).Partisan web sites reported that Obama’s Department of Justice had forced the deletion of the names of more than 500,000 fugitives with outstanding arrest warrants from the NICS database. The reports centered around an exchange between Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) and acting FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich during a 14 March Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on School Shootings and Safety, quoted as follows by the Daily Wire blog:The exchange was accurately reported, as confirmed in this excerpt from a C-SPAN video of the hearing: What the ‘s less-politicized coverage also made clear was that the policy change was the culmination of a debate that spanned three administrations, from George W. Bush’s to Donald Trump’s. According to a DOJ inspector general’s report dated September 2016, the need for official guidance on the issue was first brought to the attention of the department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in 2008 (under Bush), and had still not been resolved eight years later as Obama’s term was nearing its end:If the ‘s reporting and Bowdich’s testimony are accurate, the OLC finally did make its decision in late 2016, siding with the ATF on the meaning of “fugitive from justice.” But it was on Trump’s watch that the policy became official, with the issuance of a 15 February 2017 guidance memo from the FBI which read, in part:As previously alleged, the guidance had the immediate effect of causing the names of some 500,000 subjects to be conditionally purged from the existing NICS database because they did not meet all of the above criteria. Below are charts from the FBI showing the total numbers of active “fugitive from justice” records at the end of 2016 vs. the end of 2017:\nTaken out of context, these figures are grossly misleading, however. Approximately 430,000 of the deleted entries are actually still in the database, just under a different heading. According to the ‘s reporting, those 430,000 names were all originally submitted by the state of Massachusetts, which under its own policy classifies all people with outstanding warrants, whether for misdemeanors or felonies, as fugitives from justice. Since Massachusetts law forbids anyone so classified from buying guns, all of those names were re-entered in the NICS database under the “state prohibitor” category.That leaves a much smaller total of 70,000 people formerly classified as fugitives whose names were actually removed from the database (though some of those will be added back in if and when the FBI determines that subjects crossed state lines or qualify under other prohibitors).Despite the politicized reporting of the Justice Department’s reinterpretation of “fugitive from justice,” which was undertaken in good faith to conform to federal statutes and resolve a longstanding conflict between agencies, there’s no evidence that it was a partisan determination. The matter was first referred to the DOJ for adjudication under Bush, finally resolved under Obama, and implemented under Trump. Its consequences have been questioned by Democrats and Republicans alike.David Chipman, a former ATF official who now advises the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, has called on Congress to rewrite the statutory definition of “fugitive from justice” to include all people with outstanding arrest warrants.",

        "evidence": "On 22 January 2019, New York state enacted the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), a law that — as described by its advocates — was intended to bring New York state, which had legalized abortion prior to the 1973  ruling, in line with the less restrictive federal standards generated by that ruling and modern medical guidelines:The most controversial effect of this act was that it removed abortion from the New York criminal code. Prior to the RHA, homicide charges could encompass the abortion of “an unborn child with which a female has been pregnant for more than twenty-four weeks” even if the fetus were not viable. Now in New York abortion is regulated under public health law rather than under the criminal code.This issue drew significant national attention following the ’s coverage of the gruesome murder of Jennifer Irigoyen and her unborn child by her boyfriend, Anthony Hobson:Hobson was charged with second degree murder on 8 February 2019. The  later reported that prosecutors had “initially included a charge of abortion … but rescinded it because of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s new Reproductive Health Act.”Meris Campbell, a spokeswoman for the New York district attorney, told the  that “prosecutors dropped a second-degree abortion charge after learning that the Reproductive Health Act, which was signed on Jan. 22, had stripped the crime from the state penal code.”This case became a galvanizing point for the pro-life movement.

Alonso, a former chief assistant prosecutor in the Manhattan DA’s office, who spoke to the , the dropping of the abortion charge would not have affected Dobson’s potential sentence length:New York State Senators Liz Krueger and Anna Kaplan, the two co-sponsors of the Reproductive Health Act, argued in an 8 February 2019 editorial published in the Albany  that the RHA does not prevent “appropriate charging and sentencing of violent perpetrators”:The ambiguously constructed assertion presented by LifeNews and others that a man “Won’t Be Charged Because of New York’s Abortion Law” is only partially true. Dobson won’t be charged with “unlawful abortion” because the RHA removed that crime from the state penal code, but he is still charged with murdering his girlfriend, and the dropping of “unlawful abortion” charges against him will not alter his prospective sentence length if he is convicted.",

According to Kinney, prison visitors accounted for 58 of 62 instances of contraband smuggling between 1 February 2018 and 31 August 2018, and the policy change would cut down on prisoner overdoses.“There have been many instances in which visitors have attempted to smuggle drugs into our prisons by concealing those drugs in a body cavity, including the vagina,” Kinney said.Besides the Prison Reform Movement, the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia also condemned the policy.

She didn’t say that Black people “must be” vaccinated after health care workers but rather suggested they should be, given known deleterious effects of the virus on people of color. Her comment came in response to a question from a Time magazine journalist who asked, “Who needs [a potential COVID-19 vaccine] after health care workers?” In response to the question, she said:\nIn the U.S., that would be black people next, quite honestly, and many other people of color. They are having disproportionate effects from COVID-19. From there, people with underlying health conditions, and then people who are older. Those are the ones who all need it first.

        "evidence": "On Aug. 14, 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the so-called Annabelle doll, the supposedly supernatural toy that inspired horror films such as “The Conjuring,” had escaped from an occult museum in Connecticut:\n\nThe terms “Annabelle” and “Warren Museum” both started to trend on Twitter as social media users posted messages about the demonic doll that purportedly was on the loose. These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum — it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren’s Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book “The Amityville Horror” and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere’s an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\n\nBut the Warren’s Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens’ son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen. \nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the “Annabelle escaped” rumors.\nSpera said: “I’m here to tell you something, I don’t know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape. Annabelle’s alive — well, I shouldn’t say alive — Annabelle’s here, in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.”\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation. \nThe rumor started circulating shortly after the Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Annabelle Wallis, the actress who played Mia in the “Annabelle” movie. Wallis talked about her new film, “The Silencing,” as well as what it was like to work with Tom Cruise in “The Mummy.” Wallis also talked about “running” in her interview, and the Hollywood Reporter included a video of some of the “escape” scenes from “The Mummy.” As this news circulated on Chinese-language social media sites, the news about Wallis running appears to have been misconstrued as Annabelle (the doll) escaping.",

        "evidence": "After the police shooting of 20-year-old Latrell Allen in Chicago’s Englewood community on the afternoon of Aug. 9, 2020, unrest in that city extended through that night and into the early morning hours of the following day, with looters hitting some stores in Chicago’s wealthiest shopping district on North Michigan Avenue.\nThe following evening, members of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement held a solidarity rally in that city with some of the people who had been arrested for looting the night before. Shortly after those events, social media users began circulating a meme stemming from that event, quoting a “BLM leader & organizer” named Ariel Atkins as saying, “I don’t care if someone decides to loot, because that makes sure that person eats or has clothes. Anything they want to take, they can, because these businesses have insurance”:\n\nThat was an accurate quote, according to Chicago NBC affiliate WMAQ-TV, who reported on the Aug. 10 event:\nMembers of Black Lives Matter held a solidarity rally on Monday night [August 10] with the more than 100 individuals who were arrested after a night of looting and unrest in Chicago.\nThe rally was held at the South Loop police station where organizers say those individuals are currently being held in custody.\n“I don’t care if someone decides to loot a Gucci or a Macy’s or a Nike store, because that makes sure that person eats,” Ariel Atkins, a BLM organizer, said. “That makes sure that person has clothes.”\nBlack Lives Matter Chicago organized the rally after overnight unrest throughout the city, with police saying that more than 100 individuals were taken into custody for a variety of offenses, including looting.\n“That is reparations,” Atkins said. “Anything they wanted to take, they can take it because these businesses have insurance.”\nAtkins said essentially the same thing a few days later, when she was interviewed by Chicago NPR station WBEZ on the subject of “why she supports looting”:\nA lot of people are really attacking our pages. They’re like, ‘Oh, you support the looters.’ And yeah, we do, 100%. That’s reparations. And like however people choose to protest, especially if it was definitely in line with what happened with the shooting, which would be powerful to see people reacting … without organizers just being like, ‘We’re angry and this is what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna take the power back.’\nI feel like these stores, these Macy’s, these Guccis, the PNC Banks, they’re not here for us. The city puts way more money and investment into spending time and protecting their spaces and making sure that they exist. And yet our people are constantly being pushed out of the city … Unemployment is incredibly high, like we are in an incredible situation, and the fact that anybody gives a s*** about these businesses over what is happening in this city right now and the pain that people are in and the suffering that is taking place, I don’t care. I will support the looters ‘till the end of the day. If that’s what they need to do in order to eat, then that’s what you’ve got to do to eat …. The whole idea of criminality is based on racism anyway, because criminality is punishing people for things that they have needed to do to survive or just the way that society has affected them with white supremacist B.S.

Excerpts from that profile, which painted the young U.S. senator as conservative Democrat, emerged in multiple contexts after became a candidate for the U.S. presidency in 2019. Among the many topics covered in the  profile was the senator’s views on abortion in general and the Roe v. Wade . Speaking of that 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Biden did say that he felt it went too far: “I don’t like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don’t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body.”That statement was memorialized in meme form in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election:As we discussed in an earlier fact check, Biden’s views on abortion rights have shifted since then. In 2007, for example, Biden was given a 0% score by the (pro-life) National Right to Life Committee and a 75% score by the NARAL Pro-Choice America. “I accept church rule personally, but not in public life,” he said in October 2012. On 25 April 2019, the anti-abortion Life Site News website announced Biden’s candidacy this way: “Pro-abortion Joe Biden announces entry into 2020 presidential race.”Because the meme accurately represents public statements made by Biden in 1974, however, we rank the claim that he once said  went “too far” as true.",

        "evidence": "A Catholic newspaper in late March 2019 interviewed a purported priest, one who serves as the exorcist for his parish, about so-called ‘satanic items’ sold by big-box retailer Walmart.In a 25 March 2019 story headlined “An Exorcist Comments on Walmart’s Satanic Products,” a  (NC Register)  article cautioned that the superstore chain was tempting consumers with supernatural forces of the underworld:What are these items? The NC Register reported that they perused Walmart’s online store pages and found “demonic sculptures and figures; satanic pornography that blasphemes Christ’s crucifixion; numerous products and jewelry with pentagrams and other demonic images, and books that include the Satanic bible and books on spells. Especially featured is Baphomet, the horned, goat-headed figure trademarked as the Church of Satan symbol.”What is the harm? According to “Father Michael,” a pseudonym given to the exorcist priest interviewed by the , one could risk a demonic possession in the near future. “Just as religious objects such as a Miraculous Medal connects us with the Blessed Mother and a crucifix with Jesus, Father Michael explained that similarly, wearing an icon of something satanic opens a person up to a demonic presence,” the  warned. “’And that’s very serious,’ he said.”Snopes readers asked us whether Walmart truly sold such items. We searched the retailer’s website for products listed under the phrase “satanic,” and we found 21 pages of results (not 22, as reported by the Catholic paper). Items we turned up included , a 1969 book authored by Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey. Also available were pentagram T-shirts and little devil-shaped figurines. (Pentagrams are five-pointed stars often associated with pre-Christian paganism and favored by modern practitioners of witchcraft. But in religions derived from Christianity, pentagrams are also thought to symbolize satanism.)In fairness, some of search results included books that simply had the term “satanic” in their titles, such as the Salman Rushdie novel  and literature about the “Satanic Panic,” a moral-panic phenomenon that took hold in the U.S. in the 1970s and ’80s during which many persons were falsely accused of the ritual abuse of children. Walmart also isn’t the only major retailer to carry such items: for example, the  can be purchased through Target, Amazon, and Barnes & Noble.We reached out to Walmart for response to the  story. A company spokesman told us that “Walmart didn’t sell these items directly, but rather they were listed on our online marketplace by a third-party seller. We removed them as soon as it was brought to our attention, and we are conducting a thorough review of the seller’s products.”Marketplace is a website on which independent sellers can upload their products to be sold through the Walmart.com website. As of this writing, however, all 21 pages of “satanic” products mentioned earlier were still available for online purchase. We asked Walmart about the disconnect between their response to us and what is currently for sale on the Walmart website but didn’t receive a response.Perhaps because of its size and ubiquity, Walmart is often the focal point of various hoaxes, conspiracy theories, and fake-outrage campaigns. In February 2019 the anti-gay group American Family Association urged supporters to sign a petition criticizing the retail chain for creating a Valentine’s Day-themed ad featuring a gay couple.",

        "evidence": "In May 2019, readers questioned whether the federal government pays for erectile dysfunction medications such as Viagra, after the following image was circulated on social media:Both the image and the dollar amount it cited were dated as of this writing. The image shows a woman at a 2017 International Women’s Day rally, while the $41.6 million figure on her sign was what was spent on Viagra by the Department of Defense in 2014.The image initially made the rounds in relation to a separate controversy in 2017, when U.S. President Donald Trump announced a decision to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, claiming the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender [people] in the military would entail.” At that time, multiple news articles reported the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) was spending far more on erectile dysfunction medication than it would cost to provide medical care to transgender service members.The original sources for all these claims was a February 2015  article. That  piece presented figures provided by the Defense Health Agency (DHA), a subsidiary of the Department of Defense, which documented that in 2014:We contacted the Department of Defense, which confirmed almost all of these figures were accurate for the year 2014, with some slight corrections: the total number of prescriptions for erectile dysfunction medication was 1,178,423, of which 905,683 were for Viagra; the total spent on Cialis was $22,827,346; and the cost of prescriptions for active duty members was $7.68 million. The DoD also clarified that the number of erectile dysfunction prescriptions given to active-duty members in 2014 was 140,789, not 102,885.According to data posted on the public transparency tool USASpending.gov, the DoD continues to purchase Viagra.Attempts in both 2019 and 2017 to make political points by juxtaposing the controversy  with coverage for erectile dysfunction prescriptions for service members and their families don’t serve their causes well. For example, the Department of Defense does provide coverage for such prescriptions, but it also covers birth control.In September 2014, the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center published figures showing that the rate of erectile dysfunction diagnoses among active-component service members had doubled between 2004 and 2013, and that 48% of cases were psychogenic, meaning the erectile dysfunction was linked to mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.For context, we asked the DoD for a cost breakdown of how much it spends on birth control, but we did not receive a response by the time of publication.

        "evidence": "In August 2020, conservative Americans launched a social media campaign to call attention to the shooting death of 5-year-old Cannon Hinnant in North Carolina — a murder of a white child they claimed received little media attention compared to the recent killings of Black men by American police.\n“If you were advocating for George Floyd but NOT for Cannon Hinnant you are part of the problem,” another user wrote.\n\nWhile appropriating phrases from the country’s social movement to end racism in policing, such as “#SayHisName,” the underlying claims of the posts were these: A Black man, 25-year-old Darius Sessoms, was implicated in the shooting death of Hinnant on Aug. 9, 2020, in Wilson, North Carolina, and mainstream news outlets purposefully omitted covering the death because the child was white.\n“A 5 year old boy was executed in cold blood in America and the media is hiding it because it doesn’t fit their preferred race narrative,” one Twitter account posted.\nBased on our analysis of police statements, newsroom ethical policies, and the media coverage surrounding the child’s death, we determined the former assertion was true and the latter — that the mainstream news media exhibited a pattern of purposely ignoring the killing — was false.\nSnopes reached out to Wilson Police Chief Thomas Hopkins and the Wilson County District Attorney’s Office for documentation related to the case.\nThe requested records included a probable-cause statement that outlines officers’ investigation and would likely be the basis of a prosecutor’s argument in any criminal case. However, neither Hopkins nor the district attorney’s office returned our phone calls or email messages.\nAdditionally, Wilson police personnel denied a reporter for Raleigh’s local newspaper, The News & Observer, access to a physical copy of the police incident report, citing precautions to limit in-person contact to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, the newspaper reported. The reporter was directed to a web page on the city of Wilson’s website for information on the shooting, and police declined to comment beyond statements posted there.\nThat web page did not include copies of a police report, probable-cause statement, arrest warrant or any other documentation to outline the criminal investigation. It began with the following updates:\nOn August 9, 2020 at 5:33 p.m., officers of the Wilson Police Department were dispatched to 5100 block of Archers Road in reference to a shooting. Officers arrived on the scene and located a 5 year old suffering from a gunshot wound. Officers and EMS personnel began performing lifesaving efforts. The victim was transported to Wilson Medical Center. Tragically, the victim succumbed to their injuries. …\nOfficers of the Wilson Police Department have identified Darius N. Sessoms (Wilson/25) as the suspect in this case. Sessoms has an active warrant for 1st Degree Murder and has been entered as wanted with the [FBI’s National Crime Information Center] database, with full extradition. The Wilson Police Department is using all its resources to locate and apprehend Sessoms at this time.\nBased on that statement, Wilson police believed Sessoms fatally shot a 5-year-old child on Aug. 9, and then fled. North Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Sessoms’ arrest and identified Hinnant as the victim in a statement the following day.\n\nAccording to an interview with a spokesman for the sheriff’s office in Wayne County (about 30 miles south of Wilson), as well as the Wilson web page, a multi-jurisdictional team of law-enforcement officers including U.S. Marshalls arrested Sessoms in a home in Goldsboro, Wayne County, on Aug. 10.\nThe Wilson web page included this mugshot of Sessoms, confirming that he is a Black man:\nHe was booked in the Wilson County Jail without bond on charges of first-degree murder and made his first court appearance (virtually) with Wilson County District Court Judge John Britt on Aug. 11. There, Sessoms said he wanted to try to hire a private lawyer to argue his case.\nA GoFundMe page established by Gwen Hinnant — the child’s grandmother, according to his obituary — included the below-displayed photo that confirmed the child was white.\n\nTo recap, it was accurate to state Hinnant, a white 5-year-old, was fatally shot on Aug. 9, and the person who police believe pulled the trigger — Sessoms — is a Black man.\nNext, we searched for evidence of an alleged scheme on the part of mainstream news organizations to eschew covering Hinnant’s death because it did not fit within an alleged “preferred race narrative.”\n“Fox News is the only mainstream outlet in the U.S. that has covered Cannon’s gruesome murder,” someone claimed, referring to stories about the case on FoxNews.com.\nTo unpack this claim, we specifically considered commentary by Matt Walsh, a writer for Ben Shapiro’s Daily Wire, who wrote on Aug. 13:\nThe name Cannon Hinnant would be known across the country, and the name Darius Sessoms reviled the world over, if the races were reversed. … And there would almost certainly be rioting, spurned on in part by the incessant coverage.\nInstead, this story has gotten almost no coverage by the American national media.\nTwo days earlier, he tweeted screenshots that he said were negative search results for Hinnant’s name on the following news sites: The New York Times, The Washington Post, Reuters, Yahoo! News, NBC News, and ABC News. \nFor the purpose of our analysis, we will consider those news organizations cited by Walsh as the alleged culprits of a nefarious scheme to keep the child’s death quiet, as well as CNN and The Associated Press, two news organizations with broad audiences. As of Aug. 14, these headlines and other related stories appeared on the following news sites, partly disproving Walsh’s assertion:\nIn other words, it was inaccurate to claim CNN, The Associated Press, Yahoo! News, NBC News, and ABC News ignored Hinnant’s death.\nHowever, we found no related stories by Reuters, The New York Times, or The Washington Post, which meant we next sought evidence to prove or disprove the assertion that those sites purposefully did not cover Hinnant’s killing as part of some conspiracy to cover up the killing of a white child by a Black man.\nFor that, we reached out to the news organizations to ask why they had not covered Hinnant’s death and what factors go into those type of editorial decisions, and we will update this report when or if we hear back from them. The news organizations’ ethical policies, which are available online, however, include promises to report the news accurately and fairly without bias — standards that, in practice, would prohibit the newsrooms from only covering certain stories and purposefully hiding others as part of some nefarious scheme because of the races of those involved.\nIn sum, while it is truthful to state that Sessoms, a Black man, was charged in the shooting death of Hinnant, a white 5-year-old, in North Carolina, there is no evidence substantiating a pattern of mainstream news organizations omitting coverage of the child’s death to further a particular racial narrative or for any other purpose. For those reasons, we rate this claim a “Mixture” of fact and fiction.",

        "evidence": "U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota is a frequent target of political and sometimes Islamophobic attacks that challenge her loyalty to America. In this vein, several memes have presented claims that Omar once declared some version of the statement, “We are not here to be part of America. We are here to take over America”:We found no record of Omar’s having said these words. Further, even as a paraphrase, the sentiment expressed by the meme does not accurately reflect her views. Omar has made several public statements that explicitly detail her perspective as a refugee, immigrant, Muslim, and American citizen, and none of those sentiments involve her view that a Muslim’s role is to “take over” American society. “I took an oath to uphold the American Constitution. I am American as everyone else is,” she told  host Steven Colbert in April 2019:In several public remarks, Omar has made the argument that American Muslims are just as American as anyone else and should, especially in a nation founded on the principle of religious freedom, be able to fully express themselves in the public sphere as much as any other American. In an April 2019 speech before the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), for example, Omar argued:Following that speech, Omar told Voice of America that “she was not elected to be ‘quiet’ or ‘invisible’ and that ‘I have to use my seat and leverage to represent the voices of those who elected me.’” Omar echoed this point in the aforementioned  interview, telling Colbert “we” — referring to herself and two other progressive female politicians in their first term — “are not there to be quiet. We are not there to be invisible.”These statements, articulating Omar’s view that her job as an elected official in America is to protect her constituents’ interests in Congress as described in the U.S. Constitution, are a far cry from the claim that she said “We” — meaning Muslims — “are not here to be part of America. We are here to take over America.”Instead, the words ascribed to her in these memes are a commonly employed Islamophobic trope that asserts Muslims are unable to assimilate into America and that their ultimate goal is to covertly change the fabric of American society in their favor. This brand of Islamophobia is known in some circles as “stealth jihad” (a hashtag explicitly included in some of these memes) or in academic circles as “civilization jihad.”“Civilization jihad essentially refers to the idea that Muslim migration is a … deliberate policy of civilizational replacement,” said Jonathon O’Donnell, who researches the politics of demonization as a postdoctoral fellow at the UCD Clinton Institute for American Studies in Dublin, Ireland. Terrorist acts, he told us during a Skype call for a May 2019 Snopes investigation about Islamophobic Facebook pages, are “not the real Jihad to these peoples. The real Jihad is this more subtle form of cultural infiltration and transformation.”Because Omar never said the words attributed to her in these memes, and because her actual views on the role of Muslims in American society run demonstrably counter to the notion that they want to “take over America,” we rank this claim as false.",

        "evidence": "In September 2019, we received multiple inquiries about news reports that claimed a scientist in Sweden had proposed, advocated or suggested that people should turn to cannibalism as a way of combating climate change. \nThe Epoch Times published an article with the headline “Swedish Researcher Advocates Eating Human Flesh to Combat Climate Change Food Shortages,” which went on to report that:\n“Climate change alarmism has taken a macabre turn that looks like satire, but isn’t. It happened in Sweden. At a summit for food of the future (the climate-ravaged future) called Gastro Summit, in Stockholm on Sept. 3 to 4, a professor held a PowerPoint presentation asserting that we must ‘awaken the idea’ of eating human flesh in the future, as a way of combating the effects of climate change.\n“In a talk titled ‘Can You Imagine Eating Human Flesh?’, behavioral scientist and marketing strategist Magnus Soderlund from the Stockholm School of Economics argued for the breaking down of ancient taboos against desecrating the human corpse and eating human flesh. He refers to the taboos against it as ‘conservative’ and discusses people’s resistance to it as a problem that could be overcome, little by little, beginning with persuading people to just taste it.”\nThat Epoch Times article informed several other reports, such as the one posted by Fox News, whose headline claimed “Swedish Scientist Floats Eating Human Flesh as Solution to Global Climate Change,” and the London Evening Standard, whose headline read “Scientist Suggests ‘Eating Human Meat’ to Tackle Climate Change.”\nThe right-leaning website Breitbart posted an article with the headline, “Swedish Scientist Proposes Cannibalism to Fight Climate Change,” and Hannity.com, the website of Fox News anchor Sean Hannity, reported that: \n“A European scientist speaking at a summit in Sweden last week suggested a controversial new trend to combat climate change: consuming human flesh as an alternative to animal products.”\nAll these reports presented Söderlund as having proposed, suggested, or advocated for humans eating other humans as a way to combat the effects of climate change. In reality, the evidence for this is lacking. \nMost reports based their claims on Söderlund’s Sept. 3 interview on the TV4 television channel, which can be viewed in full (and in Swedish) below:\n \nJames Savage, CEO and publisher of The Local, a network of English-language news websites in Europe with headquarters in Stockholm, provided Snopes with a translation of the most relevant portions of the TV4 interview, adding that it would not be accurate to say Söderlund “advocated” cannibalism in his remarks. \nIn the interview, Söderlund told the host his Gastro Summit presentation was “part of a series of investigations into different kinds of food to see where to draw the line.” He added:\n“When it comes to human flesh there are various taboos that are hard to break, and it’s probably the case that human flesh will never be a large scale thing in the West or in our time. [But] given that there are so many taboos, it’s important to understand why we don’t want to do something. You could say this [presentation] is part of a study into things that people avoid doing.”\nIn light of the taboo around eating human flesh, Söderlund said, “It would be difficult for anyone who wanted to break into the human flesh business.”\nAt one point in the interview, the interviewer asked Söderlund how likely he thought it was that eating human flesh would catch on, in the same way that eating insects has been touted as a possible means to lower carbon emissions and combat food shortages. Söderlund responded that he thought cannibalism was unlikely to become appealing:\n“Two and a half billion people eat insects more or less regularly, but they’re not in the Western world. And surveys that have been carried out on people’s attitudes to insects as food show that very few people think [eating insects] is attractive and want to try it, and you’d have to assume that human flesh would have an even bigger ‘yuck factor.'”\nHe later added: “But if we need to turn over every stone when it comes to climate and sustainability, it’s still worth raising this question.”\nContrary to the claims made in various news reports, Söderlund did not advocate or propose or suggest cannibalism as a solution to the challenges of climate change in his TV4 interview. Rather, he explained that the purpose of his research and his Gastro Summit presentation was to stimulate thinking about what people would and would not be willing to do or consume in order to combat climate change, or in the event of food shortages brought on by climate change. \nThis is much less clear. The Epoch Times article included descriptions of Söderlund’s Sept. 3 presentation at the Gastro Summit in Stockholm, using terms that suggested the author had watched a video of it:\n“At a summit for food of the future (the climate-ravaged future) called Gastro Summit, in Stockholm on Sept. 3 to 4, a professor held a PowerPoint presentation asserting that we must ‘awaken the idea’ of eating human flesh in the future, as a way of combating the effects of climate change …\n“He can be seen in his video presentation and on Swedish channel TV4 saying that since food sources will be scarce in the future, people must be introduced to eating things they have thus far considered disgusting — among them, human flesh …\n“In his talk, Soderlund asks the audience how many would be open to the idea. Not many hands go up. Some groaning is heard.”\nWe have not yet found publicly available video footage of Söderlund’s presentation at the Gastro Summit on Sept. 3, nor a copy of any slideshow or PowerPoint presentation. We asked the author of the Epoch Times article for further details about the source of her descriptions, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. The event’s organizers told us they did not have a copy of the presentation, and Söderlund himself indicated that the presentation was not readily available to him, for technical reasons. \nHowever, Söderlund did provide a firm and categorical rejection of claims that he had “advocated” or “proposed” eating human flesh as a solution to climate change, and reiterated that his presentation — which involved a survey of attendees — was designed only to gauge where the audience would “draw the line” in their willingness to eat various kinds of meat, and to “ask questions” about this issue. In an email, Söderlund wrote:\nI am afraid that there have been several misunderstandings in the reporting on this issue. This is what happened: since many persons are expressing that they do not want to eat traditional meat anymore, one may wonder what we should eat instead. To collect some views on this, I had a chance to ask questions to an audience at a food fair; I showed a meat product and asked if the participants would consider eating it while I varied the content (cow, vegetarian substitute meat, insects etc). Human content was included in one version as an extreme case — to see where the limit is.\nThen, the issue ended up on various sites with alternative views on facts. I believe that the issue has somehow been hijacked by people who do not believe that global warming and other climate issues should be taken seriously — and, given this, it may indeed be useful to refer to events indicating that climate activists have completely crazy ideas (such as that we should eat each other).\nJust for the record: I do not want to eat human meat, I do not want to be eaten, I do not think that eating humans influences the climate, I am not an activist, I am just a researcher who thinks that it must be possible to ask questions about also the dark sides of what we humans do and do not do.\nNotwithstanding Söderlund’s clear and detailed account of his presentation, without being able to examine a copy of that presentation, or watch a video of it, we can’t determine definitively what he did and did not say. Until and unless that material becomes available to us, this element of the claim remains unproven. If that changes, we will update this fact check accordingly. \nHowever, we can say that Söderlund did not advocate or propose cannibalism as a solution to climate change in his TV4 interview. Rather, he merely discussed it and explained that his research involved asking questions about it. For those reasons, this element of the claim is false. On the whole, therefore, we issue a rating of “Mixture.” ",

        "evidence": "An image graphic comparing the book sales of Michelle Obama’s autobiographical memoir  and Donald Trump’s business tome  was widely shared on social media in November 2018.  The bragging point it offered was that the former first lady’s book had sold considerably more copies in one week than the current president’s book had in over three decades:However, we have to note from the beginning that accurate book sales figures are often difficult to determine, especially given the wide variety of retail outlets and publishing formats that comprise today’s literary marketplace.  Moreover, as Electric Literature noted, sales figures can refer to any one of several metrics:That said, the numbers presented here were at least taken from reasonably credible sources.  On 21 November 2018, Crown Publishing reported to the Associated Press that Michelle Obama’s memoir had sold 1.4 million copies since it had been released a week earlier: was also a hit when it was first published in 1987, spending 13 weeks at the top of the  best-seller list. Just how many copies it has sold over the last thirty-plus years is difficult to determine, however, especially since its publication antedated the adoption of the Nielsen BookScan sales tracking system.According to the 2005 book , Trump’s first publishing effort had an initial print run of 150,000 copies, and an additional 170,000 copies have been sold since Nielsen Bookscan started keeping track of sales in 2001, which leaves a considerable gap of time unmeasured. The figure cited in this graphic likely stems from a 2016 CBS News report report that quoted a source “familiar with the book’s sales” stating that 1.1 million copies of  had been sold since its initial publication.The  magazine reported a similar figure in a “tell-all” article centered on the book’s ghostwriter, Tony Schwartz:Regardless of the exact sales numbers, this meme doesn’t really offer an apt comparison of the popularity of these two very different political figures, for a number of reasons:",

        "evidence": "A rumor holding that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had been kicked out of India has been circulating online since at least May 2017, when an article pushing this claim was published on the website Steemit:\nBILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION KICKED OUT OF INDIA\nYes, the Microsoft founder and the icon of the Third-World Humanitarianism has been kicked out of India as his fraud was called out. He came to India posing as a philanthropist and humanitarian helping the Third-World poor people by alleviating their conditions and yes, of course, “VACCINATING” their children.\nThis simply wasn’t true. The Gates Foundation was not kicked out of India in 2017 when the Steemit article was published, and as of this writing in 2019, the Gates Foundation continues to work in that country.\nThe foundation is one of the largest private foundations, with offices all over the world. In India, the organization is primarily focused on the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar regions, where they are working to reduce poverty and improve access to healthcare:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/kSLB1akxtsc\nMore than a decade ago, the Government of Bihar made the decision to prioritize healthcare for mothers and children, and this focused effort has started to show impact. The child mortality rate in India’s third-biggest state has declined since then by one third.\nAs part of this investment in its people’s well-being, the state government sought partners who could provide technical support. Our foundation already had a team working on maternal, newborn, and child health, the area where Bihar wanted to focus, so in 2010 we started working together.\nThe public health system in Bihar consists of hundreds of thousands of health workers, from doctors and auxiliary nurse midwives in primary health facilities to ASHA and Anganwadi workers who provide basic advice and care to women in communities. We began by helping the government test new techniques and technologies to improve the quality of these providers’ services in eight pilot districts. For example, to help frontline workers advise women about healthy practices like breastfeeding, we developed next-generation teaching aids based on digital technology. In facilities, we established a nurse-mentoring program that has, among other successes, doubled the number of nurses who wash their hands and wear gloves before and during procedures.\nWhen rumors started to circulate that the Foundation had been kicked out of India in 2017, the country’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare released a statement disputing those reports which stated that “Some media reports have suggested that all health related collaboration with the Gates Foundation with National Health Mission (NHM) has been stopped. This is inaccurate and misleading. BMGF continues to collaborate and support the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.”\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s website has several pages dedicated to the group’s work in India. The government of India has also dispelled the rumor that the foundation was kicked out. So, was this claim simply made up out of the blue?\nThe rumor can be traced back to a study by the global health organization PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health) to see if it could reduce the number human papillomavirus (HPV) infections by providing cost-effective vaccines to impoverished communities. This trial was conducted in Uganda, Peru, and Vietnam, but it was the group’s efforts in India that caused controversy.\nBeginning in 2009, PATH worked with the Indian government’s Council of Medical Research as well as local governments to provide more than 20,000 girls between the ages of 10-14 with HPV vaccines donated by Merck & Co. (Gardasil®) and GlaxoSmithKline (Cervarix®). India’s government halted the effort in April 2010, however, when local news reports claimed seven of the girls involved in the trial had died after receiving their vaccines.\nThe government of India also opened an investigation into the matter. While the government accused PATH of a few ethical lapses (such as improperly filed consent forms), investigators concluded that the deaths were not related to the vaccines. For instance, one of the deaths related to a girl who drowned in a quarry, and another was linked to a snake bite.\nScience Magazine reported:\nState investigations absolved the trial’s managers—PATH and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in New Delhi—of responsibility in the deaths. Five were evidently unrelated to the vaccine: One girl drowned in a quarry; another died from a snake bite; two committed suicide by ingesting pesticides; and one died from complications of malaria. The causes of death for the other two girls were less certain: one possibly from pyrexia, or high fever, and a second from a suspected cerebral hemorrhage. Government investigators concluded that pyrexia was “very unlikely” to be related to the vaccine, and likewise they considered a link between stroke and the vaccine as “unlikely.” ICMR’s director general, microbiologist Vishwa Mohan Katoch, categorically rejects a connection: “Based on the enquiry, it is certain that causality of the seven deaths was not at all related to the HPV vaccine,” he insists. Other experts say that in the absence of autopsies, it is impossible to pinpoint the actual cause of death.\nSo, what does the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have to do with this? The Gates Foundation is one of PATH’s global partners and reportedly provided funding for this HPV study.\nThe Parliament of India released a report in 2013 that chastised PATH for “irregularities” with the studies. While the report recommend the government take action against PATH, this global health organization was never banned from India. In fact, as of this writing, both PATH and the Gates Foundation continue to work in the country.",

        "evidence": "In early February 2019, a meme reporting a rather exorbitant cost for the all-white outfit worn by U.S. House Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), including an alleged $1,200 for “hair and make up,” circulated on social media:The sartorial choices of the newly-elected congresswoman are often an object of internet obsession, but we saw no evidence that her State of the Union outfit was any more outlandishly expensive than that of her colleagues. Gold-colored hoop earrings, for example, can be purchased for as little as $5, a far cry from the $1,700 cost assigned to them in the meme.Although no designer has come forward to publicize their participation in Ocasio-Cortez’s outfit,  magazine reported that internet sleuths went looking for the most noteworthy item: a white cape worn in lieu of a suit jacket. Some observers matched the cape with one made by women’s clothing retailer Zara, which sells for $89.99 and not $1,500. In terms of hair and makeup, Ocasio-Cortez had her hair wrapped in an uncomplicated bun and has even revealed she wears a brand of red lipstick that costs $22.The meme contained no sources or evidence to support the claim that Ocasio-Cortez was decked out in thousands of dollars’ worth of clothing and cosmetics and appeared to be nothing more than another attempt to generate a viral rumor attacking the youngest woman serving in Congress.Ocasio-Cortez joined her fellow female lawmakers dressing in all white for the 5 February 2019 State of the Union address in honor of the suffragette movement, which paved the way for women’s voting rights in the United States.

        "evidence": "In Denver, Colorado, May 29, 2020, was the second night of major demonstrations against police brutality toward black people in the wake of George Floyd’s death. The demonstrations largely took place in front of the Colorado State Capitol Building. They were generally peaceful during the day, but turned violent in the evening.\nAround midnight, Denver police began forcibly clearing the area around the Capitol using flash bombs, chemical agents, and pepper balls. Shortly after that, on the corner of Colfax Avenue and Broadway Street, a YouTube user that goes by the name Ghost Writer livestreamed an altercation between a black man who was driving through the area while police officers were stationed at an intersection. Based on social media posts and time stamps in the live stream chat, the incident appears to have occurred at approximately 1:05 a.m. on May 30.\nThe man did not appear to be associated with the protests, but seemed angered that his car had been allegedly shot at with pepper balls before he entered the intersection. The man then stopped his car, opened the driver’s side door and stood in the street as he yelled at a group of seven officers. “Fuck you,” he said. “You shot at a car with a pregnant woman in it!”\nIn the video, the man is heard repeating at least three times the assertion that the passenger of his car was pregnant before the officers fired several rounds of pepper balls toward him. As the barrage of pepper balls hit him and his car, he repeated multiple times that his passenger was pregnant. Overcome by smoke, the man got back in his car and drove away. It does not appear, based on the video, that the officers took additional action after firing at him and his car for several seconds. We asked Denver police what happened after the incident, but they declined to answer, citing that it was an ongoing investigation.\nDenver police’s use of force guidelines for “less lethal” weapons such as pepper balls explicitly states that officers are prohibited from firing at a pregnant woman if the officer has “prior knowledge of the pregnancy.”\nDenver police have acknowledged that this incident did occur. Responding to the video, Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen told 9News, a local NBC affiliate, that he was “concerned” about “some of the snippets that I’ve seen.” We reached out to the Denver police via email with a detailed list of questions regarding the context for, and rationale behind, the actions taken by the officers in the video. In response, a spokesperson told us that “This incident is being investigated at this time. Once the investigation concludes, we will be able to provide more information.”\nThe driver has not been publicly identified at the time of this reporting. As such, we are unable to verify the man’s assertion his car had been previously shot at, or that the passenger of his vehicle was pregnant. The livestream, which can be viewed in its three-hour-long totality, had its lens trained on the groups of officers before the car pulled up at the intersection. There is no video that we have identified that can speak to any of the alleged preceding events. (If you witnessed or filmed this incident please contact Snopes here). \nOn June 4, the Denver police Twitter account acknowledged the incident and stated that they had identified — and were attempting to contact — the individuals who were in the parked car:\n\nAccording to 9News, Chief Pazen said that he “acknowledged that these moments make it harder to restore the trust these protesters want.”",

        "evidence": "In late summer 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of a viral Facebook post that claimed the popular energy drinks Red Bull and Bang test positive for various illicit substances, including methamphetamines, ecstasy, and the prescription opioids OxyContin and Suboxone.\nThe claims were posted in July by user Angie Rider Freese, who included photographs of what appeared to be a urine screen-test cup, with “Red Bull” written on the lid. We have edited her post for clarity:\n“Today at work a patient had a Red Bull. [I] told him they [test positive] on drug screens. He didn’t believe me. So I had him pour some in a new cup, and it [tested positive] for [methamphetamine] and [oxycodone] and [buprenorphine]. Also Bang will [test positive] for [ecstasy/MDMA].”\nRider Freese subsequently deleted the post in question, but she later confirmed its authenticity with a second post in which she explained that she had taken it down because its viral spread had caused her to be inundated with friend requests and messages. Although the original post was deleted, social media users have continued to share a screenshot of it, meaning its claims continued to be promulgated.\nThe claims were inaccurate and misleading in several ways, but they did allude (whether knowingly or not) to a flaw in some substance-testing field kits that have caused innocuous substances to incorrectly test positive for drugs such as methamphetamines.\nExperts told us that a false positive of this kind could, in principle, be produced in certain tests of a sample of Red Bull or other energy drinks, or a urine sample taken from a person who had consumed the beverages. However, we found no evidence of an actual pattern of such false positive test results.\nThe first point to clarify is that neither Red Bull nor Bang nor any other energy drink contains methamphetamine, buprenorphine (often sold as suboxone), oxycodone (often sold as OxyContin), or MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy or X). What the meme alluded to (whether knowingly or unknowingly) was the phenomenon of false positives, in which a drug test incorrectly indicates the presence of a substance that is not present, either in a biological specimen (usually urine and blood) or a sample of the substance in question. The ingredients of both Red Bull and Bang can be found listed here. \nDespite Rider Freese’s claim that the energy-drink samples tested positive for various drugs, it’s not clear that the urine test cup in the second photograph illustrates any such positive tests. The test strips on urine screen-test cups, such as the one shown in the photograph, invariably indicate a negative result where two horizontal red bars are visible. The only clearly visible test strips in Rider Freese’s photograph show horizontal, double red lines, suggesting negative results for unidentified substances. \nThe second misleading feature of the meme is that Rider Freese said she used a urine screen test to screen for methamphetamine, buprenorphine, and oxycodone in a sample of Red Bull. This makes little sense, because that kind of test is used to screen for illicit substances in a person’s urine, not in a beverage. \nTesting substances, rather than biological specimens, is done via a “presumptive substance test.” The typical use of such a test would be where police found a powder in someone’s car, which they suspected might be a prohibited substance like cocaine or heroin, so they either send a sample of the substance for laboratory testing, or conduct a field test themselves.\nTypically, law-enforcement agents use a type of substance testing called colorimetric testing, which involves adding a small sample of the questionable substance to a liquid solution, and inducing particular chemical reactions that cause specific changes in the color of the solution. The presence or absence of those color changes indicates the possible presence or absence of the substance being tested.\nThe following is a helpful and relatively straightforward video guide to presumptive colorimetric drug field tests, produced by Florida International University’s (FIU) National Forensic Science Technology Center:\n ﻿\nThese field tests are imperfect and can sometimes produce false positives. However, the preliminary or “presumptive” result they produce is typically enough to give a law-enforcement agent probable cause to make an arrest. After that, samples are typically sent to a laboratory for “confirmatory” testing, which either confirms the initial result, or shows that the initial result was a false positive. \nMany private companies design various kinds of field-test kits and sell them to law-enforcement agencies throughout the United States. Those kits vary in their reliability, specificity, and sensitivity, and a pattern of false positives has emerged in recent years, with various innocuous household substances showing up as illicit drugs. For example, the Marijuana Policy Project has documented cases in which chocolate tested positive for hashish, flour tested positive for cocaine, and soap tested positive for gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), which is used recreationally and as a date rape drug. \nIn 2017, Georgia woman Dasha Fincher was arrested and imprisoned for three months, awaiting confirmatory test results, after police performed a field test on a substance that produced a false positive for methamphetamine but was in fact cotton candy.\nIn principle, it’s possible that a sample of Red Bull, Bang, or some other energy drink could produce a false positive for one of the drugs mentioned in the July 2019 meme. However, we found no evidence of an actual pattern of Red Bull or Bang producing such false positives, which significantly undermines the claim that Red Bull “pops” for methamphetamine and Bang “pops” for ecstasy. \nIt should also be noted once again that Rider Freese attempted to support her claims with photographic evidence of a urine test cup, which is a different test and simply would not be used to test a sample of a beverage (or any other substance) as opposed to a urine sample. Moreover, that photograph did not clearly show a positive test for any substance.\nIt’s possible but unlikely that a urine sample provided by someone who drank a can of energy drink could test positive for methamphetamine or other drugs. Even if it did, it would only be the result of a false positive, just as in the case of substance testing.\nKirk Grates, chemistry research project manager at FIU’s National Forensic Science Technology Center, told Snopes: “… There may be some analytes that are contained within these aforementioned energy drinks that could possibly cause a false positive.”\nCertain innocuous items have been known to cause false positives for various drugs in individuals who consume them before providing a urine sample. For example, the over-the-counter, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen has caused urine samples to give false positives for phencyclidine (PCP), and other NSAIDs have provided false positives for marijuana. The urine of individuals who use a Vick’s inhaler has been known to provide a false positive for methamphetamine. \nIn principle, it’s possible that certain ingredients in Red Bull, Bang, or other energy drinks might trigger false positives for the drugs listed in Rider Freese’s meme, but we found no evidence of an actual pattern to this effect. The photographs posted by Rider Freese did not constitute evidence of a positive result for any substance, and, anyway, she claimed to have used a urine screen test cup to test a sample of Red Bull itself, rather than the urine of an individual who had consumed the drink.\nOn the whole, we found no evidence to support the specific claims made in the meme, which was in any case expressed in confusing and misleading terms. However, the meme may have alluded (whether knowingly or unknowingly) to the possibility that the energy drinks in question, like other innocuous products, could in theory produce false-positive test results for the drugs listed in the meme, either through substance or urine testing. \nAs such, we issue a rating of “Mostly False.” ",

        "evidence": "In July 2020, amid a new wave of nationwide protests over racial injustice and police brutality, readers asked us to examine the accuracy of news reports and social media posts that claimed a Five Guys burger restaurant in Daphne, Alabama, had refused to serve police officers.\nOn July 8, local television news channels WALA, WPMI, and WKRG broadcast reports that all relayed the claims of Daphne Police Department (PD) officers, who said they had entered the Five Guys restaurant at the Jubilee Square shopping center in Daphne on the previous evening, but employees there had refused to serve them. One officer reportedly heard a Five Guys employee remark to their colleagues, “I’m not serving them.”\nThe three local outlets also published articles on their websites about the incident. At the time, Five Guys provided the following statement:\nFive Guys and the Franchisee of the Daphne, AL location were made aware of reports that local Police Officers had been denied service by employees at that location. Five Guys and the franchisee are actively investigating the situation and are committed to getting to the bottom of it. However, no matter what the details are, we do not want these police officers, or any customer, to feel disrespected or slighted in anyway. We apologize to those officers and also want to make it clear that Five Guys and its franchisees are committed to fair, respectful, and equal treatment for all customers. We will continue to investigate the matter. Additionally, if there are questions about masks, the three officers who entered the restaurant were wearing masks.\nIn a statement, Daphne PD also clarified that the officers involved were wearing face masks at the time they were allegedly refused service. \nSome social media users misrepresented the alleged incident in Daphne, Alabama, calling for a boycott of all Five Guys restaurants on the false premise that the company had a policy of refusing service to police officers. \nOn July 10, Five Guys announced that some of the employees in question had been fired, and some had been suspended:\nFive Guys and the Daphne, AL franchise want to thank the Daphne Police Department for their support in working together toward a resolution. The actions the Daphne, AL franchise have taken include termination and suspension of the employees involved. The store has temporarily closed for further education and customer service training with a representative from the Daphne Police Department and will reopen at 4PM today, July 10th. As we uphold our commitment to fair, respectful, and equal treatment for all customers, please know that the actions and sentiments of a few employees in Daphne, AL do not represent Five Guys or the local franchisee.\nAccording to WALA, an unnamed police source had confirmed that several officers had indeed been refused service by Five Guys employees and that the officers claimed those employees had turned their backs towards them. Neither Daphne PD’s nor Five Guys’ formal statements provided any details on what had actually taken place in the restaurant on July 7, with the police account saying only that, “The events that occurred while the officers were in the restaurant were unfortunate.”\nHowever, Snopes has obtained a written statement from a Daphne PD spokesperson. We asked whether the officers had been refused service because of their status as police officers or for some other incidental reason. In response, the spokesperson told us that:\n“Regular customers were served immediately before and immediately after the officers left the restaurant. When the officers came in the establishment, they were refused service by two employees that were directly responsible for taking orders. Two of the officers involved overheard one of the employees make the statement ‘I’m not serving them.’ After hearing this statement, the officers left the restaurant without incident.”\nThe spokesperson indicated they could not confirm that some employees had “turned their backs” on the officers because of the presence of line cooks at the restaurant, who may not have been aware of the officers’ arrival and therefore may have remained with their backs turned at all times, anyway.\nThe spokesperson also praised the response of Five Guys management and added: “The resulting backlash the restaurant endured as a result of this event was very unfortunate and I want to make it clear that we do not hold the restaurant responsible for the actions of a select few employees.”\nThe fact that Five Guys has disciplined and fired several employees certainly indicates that an incident of note occurred on July 7, but so far the company has not actually corroborated the version of events presented by Daphne PD.\nWe asked the company whether they could confirm that some of its employees at the Jubilee Square restaurant did in fact refuse to serve police officers, whether they had turned their backs on the officers, whether any refusal had been on the basis of the would-be customers’ status as police officers, the number of employees fired and suspended, and details on the investigative steps the company took before firing and suspending the employees. Despite making several attempts to contact Five Guys, we did not receive a response of any kind. \nWithout the company’s corroboration of the version of events presented by Daphne PD, we cannot conclude that Five Guys employees in Daphne did, in fact, refuse to serve local police officers, and that they refused to serve them because they are police officers. As such, we are issuing a rating of Unproven. If we receive corroborating evidence or a corroborating statement from Five Guys, or the employees involved, we will update this fact check accordingly. ",

        "evidence": "A two-week effort  to rescue endangered and missing minors led by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) Missing Child Unit in August 2020 — nicknamed Operation Not Forgotten — resulted in the recovery of 39 children.\nAlongside other federal, state, and local agencies, the USMS said they rescued 26 missing children, and ensured the safe locations of 13 more, while arresting nine individuals in connection with alleged crimes ranging from sex trafficking to parental kidnapping.\nThe large number of children found during the initiative immediately attracted the attention of internet rumormongers. Snopes readers shared a number of memes with us claiming that the children were all found in one trailer. \n\nHow is finding 39 missing children in a double wide trailer here in Georgia NOT the biggest news story in America?\n— King Randall, I. (@NewEmergingKing) August 28, 2020\n\nWhile the rescue itself indeed took place, according to the USMS, the descriptions of the circumstances around the discovery of the children in these memes were largely untrue.\nAccording to a statement from the USMS, and information provided to us by Josue Rivera, an inspector from USMS involved in the investigation, the two-week operation took place in various counties throughout Georgia, and children were also rescued from Florida, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. Since it occurred over a long period of time in more than one location, it is unlikely that all the children could have been found in one trailer. Rivera described at a press conference the locations where the children were found and the arrests of the alleged perpetrators were made, including motels, apartment complexes, and other residences. \nThe U.S. Marshals’ office described the different circumstances for the missing children:\nThese missing children were considered to be some of the most at-risk and challenging recovery cases in the area, based on indications of high-risk factors such as victimization of child sex trafficking, child exploitation, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and medical or mental health conditions. Other children were located at the request of law enforcement to ensure their wellbeing. USMS investigators were able to confirm each child’s location in person and assure their safety and welfare.\nThe missing children ranged in ages from three to 17. We reached out to USMS and learned that fifteen of the children were identified as victims of trafficking. The other children were victims of parental kidnappings, children who absconded from the Division of Family and Children Services (DFACS), Department of Juvenile Justice custody, and were believed to be in danger or critically missing. A majority of the children were runaways who fell into the human trafficking realm. \nInvestigators said nine people were arrested on warrants that included sex trafficking, registered sex offender violations, possession of drugs and weapons, and custodial interference. A few of the arrests were made in Florida, where one child was also rescued after being found with a parent who had arrest warrants for various sexual offenses. USMS provided us with a list of the nine people arrested and their alleged connections to the crimes: \nWe should note that the USMS has been accused of exaggerating its success in the past. In 2018, the USMS said they found 123 missing children in an operation in Michigan, while state police said just four of the children were actually missing, and many of them were found with their guardians.\nDave Oney, a USMS spokesperson, told us that these headlines were “misleading.” He argued that they had actually “cleared 123 cases,” and not rescued all 123 children. Many of the children reported as missing earlier had come back, he said, and the people who reported them had not updated the USMS. \nOperation Not Forgotten was a joint effort between the USMS, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Georgia Office of the Attorney General, Georgia Department of Family and Children Services, Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. \nAccording to the most recently available statistics from the FBI, there were 421,394 reported cases of missing people below the age of 18 in the U.S. in 2019. Out of those, 90 to 91% were considered endangered runaways, according to Donald Washington, director of USMS, and one in six of those endangered runaways were likely to become victims of sex trafficking.\nGiven that the main source of information we have about the recovery of these missing children in Georgia is from the USMS — an organization that has been accused of misrepresenting numbers in the past — and there is no proof all these children were found in one trailer, we rate this claim a “Mixture.”",

        "evidence": "A recurring bit of pandemic misinformation alleges that COVID-19 is not caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or, for that matter, any virus at all. Despite voluminous evidence that COVID-19 is a viral infection, this claim —  or aspects of it — persist online. In general, the same flawed pseudoscientific argument has been employed in multiple instances to suggest that COVID-19 — with over 20 million cases and a death toll of over 160,000 at the time of this reporting — is just a big classification error.\nThe claim that went viral on several social media platforms blends the misinterpretation of a preliminary and unpublished research paper with the baseless assertion that the World Health Organization (WHO) mandated that no autopsies be performed on COVID-19 victims — a paranoid flourish used to imply a global conspiracy. By ignoring this alleged ban, the story goes, Italian doctors revealed that COVID-19 was actually a bacteria, and that, for some reason, aspirin can cure the disease.\nThe only factual element of the above narrative is that Italian researchers analyzed autopsy results of COVID-19 patients. They published a preprint of a research study based on post-mortem lung analyses of 38 patients in two Italian hospitals in April 2020. That study, which explicitly stated that COVID-19 is caused by coronavirus, suggested that a condition known as Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) was the “predominant” feature of all of the cases. This potential finding was notable since pneumonia was thought to be the primary factor leading to death in COVID-19 cases at the time. While it is a general medical term used to describe a damaging immune and blood-clotting response to a lung injury, DAD is not a disease, but instead a condition potentially caused by a variety of diseases. \nThat finding — along with the presence of clotting cells known as “platelet-fibrin thrombi” in the patients’ lungs — suggested to the authors that preventing complications from blood clotting (coagulopathy) could be a promising area for potential COVID-19 treatments. After this paper was uploaded to the preprint server MedRxiv, misinformation followed.\nAn inaccurate copypasta description of this study from mid-May interpreted those results as evidence that Covid-19 stemmed from “a serious pathophysiological diagnosis error,” that death from the disease stems from thrombosis (or blood clotting), and that the COVID-19 “ought to be fought with antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.” This is how aspirin entered the zeitgeist. As a drug with anticoagulant properties, it could theoretically be employed to reduce complications from thrombosis.\nPerhaps because the inaccurate but viral description of the study included antibiotics (which would be used to prevent bacterial co-infections, not the actual COVID-19 infection) as a treatment, or perhaps because some online conspiracy accounts asserted it, online claims about this Italian study soon morphed into the notion that it exposed the coronavirus as a bacterial infection.\n“Breaking Covid news!” began a loosely intelligible bit of copypasta from late May, “Italy has allegedly discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium.” These results were only possible, viral claims now asserted, because Italian doctors had defied a WHO ban on autopsies.\nIt is unclear how the notion that a ban on autopsies was instituted by the WHO first emerged. As British fact-checking outlet Full Fact pointed out when the claim first went viral, “the WHO released guidance on [March 24 2020] on safety measures for managing bodies and performing post-mortems on patients who had died of Covid-19.” Numerous studies have published post-mortem analyses of Covid patients, including some that predate the Italian study.\nOn top of that, there is no actual scientific debate regarding the viral origins of COVID-19, which was linked to a coronavirus even in the earliest public reports from China. Scientists have isolated and mapped SARS-CoV-2’s entire genome based on samples taken from infected humans. Billions of dollars have been invested into finding a vaccine against it based on science’s understanding of the basic fact that a coronavirus caused this pandemic.\nDespite the myriad factual hurdles one must leap over to label COVID-19 a bacterial infection, the claim (based on this same paper) persists. Some versions of the Italian autopsy story have been used to make an even more dubious assertion that the bacteria allegedly causing COVID-19 are “amplified by 5G.” This claim, despite still being pushed by snake oil salesmen like David “Avocado” Wolfe, comes from a study that was retracted because its authors were found to have manipulated the peer-review process to get it published.",

        "evidence": "In September 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation made public documents relating to its now-closed investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server for government business, posting them to its public document platform known as The Vault.At the time of the document dump, both Clinton’s then-presidential campaign rival Donald Trump and the news media picked up on what seemed to be a salacious detail: that at some point in the past, an aide had used a hammer to destroy Clinton’s old mobile devices. The document underlying that tidbit of information stated that “[Clinton aide Justin] Cooper did recall two instances where he destroyed Clinton’s old mobile devices by breaking them in half or hitting them with a hammer.”That sentence, pulled from a 47-page document, made it into one of now-President Donald Trump’s famous Twitter tirades against a Department of Justice’s Special Counsel-led investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which has swept up some of Trump’s circle of associates with indictments:According to FBI documents, investigators determined a total of thirteen devices were associated with Clinton’s two phone numbers and personal email domain, eight of which she used during her tenure as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. The FBI requested that all thirteen devices be handed over, but  Clinton’s attorneys informed the FBI that they were “unable to locate any of these devices,” so the bureau was unable to examine them. Another Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, told FBI agents that the whereabouts of Clinton’s unwanted devices would “frequently become unknown.”The FBI, then headed by former director James Comey, famously and controversially cleared Clinton of any criminal charges, with Comey announcing on 5 July 2016 that the FBI found no evidence of intentional misconduct, although the Secretary and her aides were “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.”As the technology magazine  reported at the time, destroying an unwanted device is not in and of itself suspicious, and such an action could well have been an earnest (if clumsy) effort to ensure that any data stored on the devices would not be retrieved and fall into the wrong hands after they were thrown away:",

        "evidence": "A pair of photographs reportedly showing a severely dehydrated homeless veteran named Kent near death on the streets of Los Angeles started making their way around social media in September 2018:These images were apparently so shocking to some viewers that they suggested the photographs perhaps showed an artwork or a Halloween decoration as opposed to a real human being. Unfortunately, these  pictures are genuine.The photographs were first posted online by Facebook user Nick Spano on 22 September 2018. The original Facebook post contained a lengthy bit of text which was largely concerned with Spano’s view on how the homeless (especially homeless veterans) are treated in the United States, along with a few details about the pictured individual, who was said to be a 68-year-old man named Kent. The man told Spano that he was a veteran and that he was “looking for a place to die” when Spano brought him some water before paramedics arrived to take him to the hospital:Spano updated his post a few days later but he didn’t have much additional information to report:Without Kent’s last name, it’s difficult to verify some of the details in this Facebook post, but it doesn’t bear any of the hallmarks that have revealed similar posts to be hoaxes. For instance, we could not find any record of these photographs appearing online prior to Spano’s post, which supports  that Spano truly was the person who took them. This post also doesn’t include a call to action urging users to share it (which is a common tactic for disingenuous clickbait).We contacted Spano for more information about Kent, and he provided us with security camera footage to verify that his photographs were authentic and noted that Kent had told him during previous interactions he was a veteran. Spano never got Kent’s last name, however, and Kent didn’t have any ID on him when he was taken away by paramedics.While we can’t officially verify whether or not Kent was a veteran, his story is, unfortunately, rather plausible. According to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, approximately 40,000 veterans in the United States are homeless on any given night.",

        "evidence": "In July 2020, a rumor started to circulate online that typing any three-digit number followed by the words “new cases” into Google would return news articles or other reports about COVID-19 in search results. This, according to proponents of this claim, showed that the coronavirus pandemic was nothing more than a conspiracy theory. \n\nIn all honesty, we had trouble following the logic of this false rumor.\nThose spreading these “mind blowing” search results also appeared a little unsure of what it meant. Most of the posts we encountered did not lay out any specific claims or accusations. Rather, these messages contained vague statements about how the world was being “played.” As best we can tell, the idea is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (or, possibly, some shadowy group of elites, George Soros, or another frequently invoked boogeyman) were gaming search results in order to inundate the population with coronavirus content and convince everyone that this “hoax” was in fact a real problem. \nThere are, of course, a number of problems with this theory. \nMostly true. We have not typed each of the 900 three-digit numbers (100-999) into Google followed by “new cases,” but we did perform a few dozen searches in this manner and in every instance we did get results related to rising COVID-19 cases. For some numbers (typically on the higher range of the three-digit set), Google had to dig back weeks or months in order to find news articles related to the specific search term. \nNot really. Although some may see (or claim to see) these search results as “mind blowing,” this actually isn’t all that unusual considering the duration (approximately 8 months, as of this writing) and widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nConsider this: The first case of COVID-19 in the United States was reported in January 2020. Since then, the disease has spread to all 50 states. In the approximately 200 days between the early COVID-19 cases and this writing, state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial entities have reported case numbers to the CDC. Many cities have also held daily press briefings. In addition to multiple entities recording and reporting on these numbers, there have also been national and local news outlets publishing articles on a daily basis about this data. \nLet’s take a look at the math. \nIf each of the 50 states issued daily reports about COVID-19 cases for 200 days, that would mean 10,000 reports could contain a three-digit number of COVID-19 cases. There are approximately 19,500 municipal governments in the United States. If every one of those governments reported a daily rise in cases over this 200 days, that’s an additional 3,900,000 reports that could contain a three-digit number of COVID-19 cases. If you factor in local and national newspapers and websites (we’ll use 13,000, the number of daily newspapers in circulation in 2014; the actual number is likely much higher due to an unknown number of online news websites), that’s an additional 2,600,000 reports about COVID-19. \nEven if you reduced the number of possible days from 200 to 120 (lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020), that’s still millions of daily reports that could possibly show a three-digit rise in case numbers.\nIt should also be noted that Google can return search results from international organizations, cities, and news outlets. In other words, there are millions of articles and reports that Google can comb through in order to find a result for each of the 900 possible three-digit numbers.\nHerein lies an even bigger hole in the conspiracy theory. Out of the dozens of social media posts we encountered from people spreading this rumor, we have not seen anyone correctly claim that the search results provided by Google were inaccurate. Our own searches resulted in genuine news articles from national and local media that cited credible sources.\nThe fact that searching for any three-digit number followed by the words “new cases” results in genuine news articles about COVID-19 does not reveal that the world is being “played.” Quite the contrary: Testing this “conspiracy theory” actually shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is a real and widespread threat. \nThis rumor appears to be an offshoot of a similar conspiracy theory that circulated last month. Previously, the word on the internet was that COVID-19 data was suspicious because a number of cities around the world had reported that there had been “322” cases or deaths from coronavirus. The fact that multiple locations had reported the same number of cases, according to proponents of this theory, “proved” that this pandemic was manufactured.\nAgain, this is simply a matter of probability. With thousands of cities, states, countries, government organizations, academic institutions, and newspapers around the world reporting daily on COVID-19 cases and deaths, it is inevitable that some numbers are going to be repeated. \nUSA Today reported:\nThe content of the claim is ridiculous, as is the implication there is something shady or manufactured in the way these tallies are reported. The volume of media reports on COVID-19, the number of cases and the number of local and regional units of government means there is ample opportunity for tallies to add up to just about any number, particularly in the low triple digits. Google searches prove out that 322 isn’t even a particularly common number.",

        "evidence": "In late March 2020, amid a widening COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. President Donald Trump sought to blame previous administrations for the fact that frontline medical workers facing a spike in cases were reporting urgent shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE), notably N95 respirator masks that filter out particles in the air.\n“So, many administrations preceded me. For the most part, they did very little, in terms of what you’re talking about,” Trump stated during a March 21 press conference when asked by a reporter about protective medical gear shortages.\nRight-leaning media outlets followed suit, focusing the blame more narrowly on the administration of former President Barack Obama in particular. “Report: Obama Admin Depleted Stockpile of N95 Masks, Never Restored,” a Breitbart.com headline read. “Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg News: Federal stockpile of N95 masks was depleted under Obama and never restocked,” Washington Examiner reported. Readers asked Snopes.com to verify the claim that the Obama administration was directly responsible for the shortage of equipment.\nThe reports on pro-Trump websites relied on selectively culled facts from other sources to weave a somewhat misleading narrative. It’s true that both Bloomberg and Los Angeles Times, for example, reported that the national stockpile of N95 masks was largely depleted under the Obama administration during the swine flu epidemic, and that the depletion was not corrected.\nFrom the Times’ report on March 20, 2020:\nAfter the swine flu epidemic in 2009, a safety-equipment industry association and a federally sponsored task force both recommended that depleted supplies of N95 respirator masks, which filter out airborne particles, be replenished by the stockpile, which is maintained by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nThat didn’t happen, according to Charles Johnson, president of the International Safety Equipment Assn.\nBut both the Times and Bloomberg pointed out that Congress and the Trump administration bore some responsibility for the current medical equipment shortages as well.\nBloomberg reported that Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar told Congress in February 2020 that the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), a reserve of emergency medical supplies, contained “30 million surgical masks and 12 million of the more protective N95 masks. He said there were an additional 5 million N95 masks that may have passed their expiration date” in the stockpile, which at that time had not yet been tapped to deal with COVID-19. \nBut as far back as 2015, government scientists had estimated that “a severe flu outbreak infecting 20 to 30 percent of the population would require at least 1.7 billion of the N95 respirators.” The SNS didn’t have that quantity on hand, even before the swine flu broke out (in 2009 the SNS distributed 85 million N95 respirators).\nThe Times also reported that the Trump administration, which is currently in its third year, ignored alarms raised by various government agencies early on that the U.S. was not prepared for a pandemic:\nAs the current crisis has widened, President Trump has attempted to deflect responsibility for his administration’s poor planning, suggesting the coronavirus outbreak was inconceivable.\n“Nobody knew there would be a pandemic or epidemic of this proportion,” the president said Thursday.\nThe opposite is true. The [Government Accountability Office], public health experts and others issued a steady drumbeat of warnings that America would sooner or later face a widespread infectious disease outbreak or a major bioterrorism attack and was woefully unprepared.\nIn both 2018 and 2019, U.S. intelligence agencies issued insistent warnings in their annual Worldwide Threat Assessment.\n“We assess that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support,” the 2019 report noted.\nIt’s true, as reported by Bloomberg and the Los Angeles Times, and the partisan websites that borrowed from their reporting, that the supply of protective masks in the Strategic National Stockpile was largely depleted during the Obama administration, which then failed to restock the supply. But it’s also true that the Trump administration ignored indications that the SNS remained understocked and the country was ill-prepared for a pandemic in the years leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe claim that the Obama administration “caused” or was solely responsible for the current shortage of medical equipment such as N95 protective face masks omits that wider context. We therefore rate this claim “Mixture.”",

That has increasingly raised questions about the extent to which evangelical beliefs are influencing American diplomacy.”\nThat questioning of Pompeo’s mixture of religiosity and policy was reflected in a meme circulated in January 2020, amidst escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran over the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian Gen.

We expect to launch the product shortly …”\nThe pharmaceutical company’s press release, also published on Jan. 13, read as follows:\n“Lannett Company, Inc. today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the New Drug Application (NDA), submitted under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, for Cocaine Hydrochloride (HCl) Nasal Solution 4% (40 mg/mL), the company’s branded local anesthetic product … NUMBRINO® (cocaine hydrochloride) nasal solution is an ester local anesthetic indicated for the introduction of local anesthesia of the mucous membranes for diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or through the nasal cavities of adults.”\nThe press release, and Merry Jane’s article, were accurate. In a Jan. 10 letter addressed to Cody Laboratories, a subsidiary of the Philadelphia-headquartered Lannett, the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research wrote:\n“[Your] new drug application provides for the use of NUMBRINO for the introduction of local anesthesia of the mucous membranes for diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or through the nasal cavities of adults … We have completed our review of this application, as amended. It is approved, effective on the date of this letter, for use as recommended in the enclosed agreed-upon labeling.”\nNumbrino does indeed contain cocaine hydrochloride, the drug commonly abused for recreational purposes, but an FDA spokesperson explained to Snopes in a statement that the manner of its deployment as a local anesthetic was designed to safeguard against dependency:\n“Cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution contains cocaine, a Schedule II substance with a high potential for abuse. However, when used according to the directions provided in the labeling, physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms are unlikely to develop because this drug is for single use during diagnostic procedures and surgeries. To minimize these risks, the labeling suggests that health care facilities using the drug implement effective accounting procedures, in addition to routine procedures for handling controlled substances. Notably, this will be used as an anesthetic by trained health care professionals during diagnostic procedures and surgeries, not by patients directly. It is not available by prescription.”\nNumbrino is not the first local anesthetic containing cocaine to be approved by the FDA. In 2017, the agency approved a cocaine hydrochloride product called Goprelto which, like Numbrino, is also intended for use as a painkiller during surgeries and procedures in the nasal cavities. ",

        "evidence": "Two days into the 2020 new year, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, setting off an escalating series of events that included Iran pulling out of its 2015 nuclear deal with the U.S. and other world powers, threats of retaliation traded in both directions, and the Iraqi parliament voting to end the presence of thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq.\nCritics of the president’s decision voiced fears that it brought the U.S. to the brink of yet another long, bloody war in the Middle East. But some of Trump’s supporters pointed out that former President Barack Obama also engaged in drone warfare. \nFor instance, social media users widely shared a statistic that Obama ordered 542 drone strikes while president, resulting in the deaths of 3,797 people, including 542 civilians. Snopes.com readers asked us to verify the figures. Here is an example of the information and how it was being used on social media. We have cropped this Twitter user’s name out for privacy reasons.\n\nOther than an apparent typo in the civilian death-toll count above, the figures being shared are based on the reporting of political scientist Micah Zenko, who in 2017 reported for the non-profit research organization Council on Foreign Relations that “The 542 drone strikes that Obama authorized killed an estimated 3,797 people, including 324 civilians.” Zenko’s figures are based on U.S. military press releases and news reports.\nAs Zenko noted, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released two reports tallying drone strikes under the Obama administration. The first reported that there were 473 strikes between January 20, 2009, and December 31, 2015, in “areas of active hostilities” that included Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The second reported that there were another 53 strikes in the same region for 2016, bringing the total to 526, a figure that doesn’t include Obama’s final 20 days in office in January 2017. \nThe reports provide ranges for fatalities, with 2,372 to 2,581 “combatants” killed from 2009 to 2015, and 64 to 116 civilians killed in that time frame. In 2016, one civilian was killed while the report states anywhere from 431 to 441 combatants were killed.\nExact figures on total number of strikes and resulting casualties depend on the source. Independent organizations that have tracked air strikes made in the U.S.-led global war on terror generally produce figures that are higher than those produced by the U.S. government. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, for example, reported there were a total of 563 air strikes authorized by Obama, “largely by drones,” which hit targets in Somalia, Yemen, and Pakistan. Meanwhile, New America, a public policy think tank, estimates there were 571 drone strikes under the Obama administration in Somalia, Yemen, and Pakistan.\nThe drone program under Obama and the strike that killed Soleimani are not apt comparisons. The U.S. has been carrying out drone warfare in the region since the administration of George W. Bush, Obama’s predecessor. Although such warfare has always been controversial, the fallout over the killing of Soleimani is the result of his status in the Iranian government. As Reuters reported, “Major General Qassem Soleimani was the second most powerful man in Iran. He answered only to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.” His killing, per Reuters, “struck at the heart” of leadership in Tehran.\nIn March 2018, Trump revoked an Obama executive order requiring an annual disclosure of civilian deaths resulting from drone strikes. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism also reported that the number of drone strikes ratcheted up during Trump’s first year in office, doubling in Somalia and tripling in Yemen.",

        "evidence": "U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) is a career politician who cut his teeth in the New York State Assembly before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1981, where he served nine terms prior to winning a U.S. Senate seat in 1998.As the voice of the opposition party in the Senate, Schumer was frequently at odds with President Trump and the Republicans. These disputes spilled over into social media, where Schumer not only exchanged barbs with the president himself, but was regularly attacked by Trump supporters hoping to discredit him.In December 2018, some of Trump’s followers shared posts asserting that Schumer had been “caught” accepting excessive campaign contributions and failing to properly disclose expenses in 1998:The proximate source of the accusation appeared to be an 11 December editorial by Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson attempting to refute the argument that Trump’s alleged hush money payments to mistresses during the 2016 presidential campaign constituted grounds for impeachment because they violated campaign finance laws.In defense of Trump, Carlson noted that both Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer paid hefty fines to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for past campaign violations yet suffered no further legal consequences for their actions (emphasis added):As we’ve had occasion to explain before, the hush money payments Trump’s attorney admitted making on his behalf and more routine campaign finance violations such as failing to comply with contribution caps or improperly disclosing expenses bear little similarity. Although Obama’s 2008 campaign was indeed fined $375,000 by the FEC for not providing timely notice of contributions exceeding $1,000, the violation was not deemed intentional and did not rise to the level of a prosecutable offense.Neither did the violations alleged in Schumer’s case rise to the level of a prosecutable offense, as enumerated in an FEC audit report released to the public in April 2001. The figures cited by Carlson roughly matched those contained in a summary of the audit published that May:As noted by the FEC, the larger figure ($6,354,835 in improperly disclosed disbursements, characterized as “expenses”) comprised amounts that were erroneously reported as lump sum entries instead of being broken out by date and amount as required. The error was subsequently corrected.It’s misleading to say that Schumer was “caught” taking excessive campaign contributions. The contributions were categorized by the FEC as such on a technicality: Schumer’s campaign failed to comply with a rule (later dropped from FEC regulations) stipulating that checks accepted from joint bank accounts be signed by both account holders. A small fraction of those donations were duly refunded, leaving an outstanding $854,404 in contributions that still met the criteria for being “excessive,” FEC auditors concluded. The Schumer campaign committee’s lawyer affirmed to Associated Press in April 2003 that:For the latter violation, the campaign agreed to pay a fine of $130,000 (not $138,000, as later claimed by Carlson and others). However, the suggestion that the violations and subsequent fine ought to have disqualified from remaining in office is unrealistic and naive.“There are always reporting violations in campaigns,” a former FEC commissioner told us in February 2018. Some violations are more serious than others, but even when they result in large civil penalties (as in the cases of the Schumer and Obama campaigns), they are rarely regarded, in the absence of criminal intent, as having any bearing on a candidate’s fitness to hold office. In 1993, for instance, the FEC fined Sen. Bob Dole’s (R-Kansas) 1988 presidential campaign $120,000 for accepting improper corporate donations and exceeding spending limits, yet Dole not only ran for president again but remained in office right up until his retirement in 1996.",

        "evidence": "In August 2019, as the topic of mass shootings again gripped the United States after back-to-back massacres, numerous pundits and social media users attempted to suss out the reason why such attacks keep happening. Some blamed gun-control laws and a rise in white supremacy, while others laid the blame on mental illness, video games, a lack of thoughts and prayers, gay marriage, and fatherless households.\nThe latter assertion about fathers isn’t uncommon. One supposed statistic often circulated after a mass shooting is that 26 out of the 27 deadliest mass shooters in the U.S. came from fatherless homes. On Aug. 5, Fox News played a clip of Dr. Warren Farrell offering this statistic before an interview:\n\nThis statistic is both outdated and incorrect. \nThe number is most often shared via a link to an article on Real Clear Politics. That article, however, is simply a blurb linking to a post on Patheos, which in turn cites heavily from an opinion piece by Suzanne Venker that was published on Fox News in February 2018. If we follow the trail a bit further, we arrive at a 2015 article in The Federalist about the impact fatherless homes may have on young men (and more specifically mass shooters). \nHowever, that article did not state that “26 out of the 27 deadliest mass shooters came from fatherless homes.” Instead, that article claimed that seven of the deadliest mass shootings were perpetrated by males under the age of 30, and out of that seven, only one was raised by his biological father:\nOn CNN’s list of the “27 Deadliest Mass Shootings In U.S. History,” seven of those shootings were committed by young (under 30) males since 2005. Of the seven, only one — Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho (who had been mentally unstable since childhood) — was raised by his biological father throughout childhood.\nWhen The Federalist first published the article, the most recent shooting listed in CNN’s article, “27 Deadliest Mass Shootings in U.S. History,” had occurred on June 17, 2015. Since then, 12 more mass shootings have been added to that list. The most recent mass-shooting suspect in the U.S., Connor Betts, who allegedly killed 10 people in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 4, 2019, was raised by both a father and mother. \nWe examined the original CNN list the Federalist article cited and attempted to find out if any of the other listed shooters was raised by a father. This information was not readily available from previous studies or databases, and newspaper records didn’t always provide specific information about familial relations. Furthermore, it’s unclear if the “fatherless” household claim would include stepfathers, adoptive fathers, or divorced parents. Because the Federalist article originally pointed to males under 30, it’s also unclear if this “fatherless” examination should include mass shooters over the age of 30. \nFor the purposes of this article, we searched contemporaneous news reports to see if any of the shooters originally listed in CNN’s “27 Deadliest Mass Shootings in U.S. History” article grew up in households with a father. We found that several of them did.\nSeung-Hui Cho, a 23-year-old who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007, was raised by both a father and a mother. So was George Hennard, who killed 23 people in Killeen, Texas, in 1991; Charles Whitman, who killed 17 people at the University of Texas in Austin in 1966; Nidal Malik Hasan, who fatally shot 13 people at Fort Hood in 2009; Jiverly Wong, who killed 13 in 2009 in Binghamton, New York; and Aaron Alexis, who fatally shot 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013. James Huberty, who killed 21 people at a McDonald’s in the San Ysidro neighborhood of San Diego, California, in 1984, was raised by a single father (and later a father and stepmother) after his biological mother abandoned the family. \nIn short, the claim that “26 out of the 27 deadliest mass shooters came from fatherless homes” is based on a misreading of outdated statistics. Furthermore, this claim was based on a list of the “worst mass shooting” incidents (what appears to be eight or more deaths), and so did not include all of the mass shootings in the U.S. As this list only represented a small portion of the total number of mass shootings as of the time it was compiled, it simply does not provide enough data to come to any conclusions about how a mass shooter is impacted by a fatherless home. ",

        "evidence": "In late October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of social media posts that claimed members of the family of U.S. President Donald Trump had been barred from operating charities in New York state, after they were found to have “stolen” from a children’s cancer non-profit. \nThe running of Trump family-related businesses and charities has been the subject of intense scrutiny, and even legal action, for several years. However, some of the allegations got a new lease on life in October 2019 after widespread sharing of one tweet, which read:\n“Never Forget. The Trump family was disallowed from operating ANY charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity.”\nNever Forget. The Trump family was disallowed from operating ANY charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. https://t.co/AwwbgWYDzB\n— Bruno Amato (@BrunoAmato_1) October 5, 2019\nThose claims were further promulgated a few days later, when a screenshot of Bruno Amato’s tweet was posted to Facebook by a user who goes by the name Donald Shirley:\n  \nWere Trump family members banned from running charities in New York?\nIn June 2018, then-New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood sued the president, his son Eric and daughter, Ivanka, along with the Donald J. Trump Foundation charity. Underwood wrote that:\n“For more than a decade, the Donald J. Trump Foundation has operated in persistent violation of state and federal law governing New York State charities. This pattern of illegal conduct by the Foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law.”\nAs a result, Underwood asked the New York State Supreme Court to “dissolve the Foundation for its persistently illegal conduct, enjoin its board members from future service as a director of any not-for-profit authorized by New York law, to obtain restitution and penalties, and to direct the Foundation to cooperate with the Attorney General in the lawful distribution of its remaining assets to qualified charitable entities.”\nSpecifically, the attorney general asked the court to bar the president from running any New York-based charities for 10 years, and the other directors for one year. \nIn December 2018, the attorney general and the defendants reached an agreement to dissolve the Trump Foundation and distribute its assets to a list of agreed charities. However, that agreement did not include Underwood’s request that President Trump, along with Eric and Ivanka, be barred from operating a New York-based non-profit organization in the future, for varying periods of time. \nIn January 2019, Letitia James took over as New York attorney general and continued the state’s case against the Trumps. On Nov. 7, the state’s Supreme Court published a final resolution of the case, one which did not bar either President Trump or his children Eric and Ivanka, from running charities in the state of New York.\nHowever, President Trump was forced to agree to certain stipulations involving governance, leadership structure and record-keeping, in the event that he wishes to become a non-profit director or board member within the state, in future. As part of the final settlement, Eric and Ivanka Trump were required to undergo (and have already undergone) “an in-person, interactive board training session pertaining to charitable organizations and the fiduciary responsibilities of those organizations’ directors and officers.”\nThe final resolution of the case, published on Nov. 7, made it clear that the New York Supreme Court had not barred members of the Trump family from operating or running charities within the state, and so this element of the claim contained in Amato’s viral tweet was false. However, it should be emphasized that at the time Amato posted his tweet (Oct. 5), that final resolution had not yet been published, and it was released only after this fact check was published.\nWhen Amato made his claims, a realistic possibility still existed that the court might indeed accept the Attorney General’s request to bar the family members outright from running charities in the state, for various time periods. On that basis, we originally issued a rating of “Mostly False.” However, the case was subsequently resolved without those outright bans being implemented, and therefore we have change the rating to “False.”\nDid Trump family members steal from a children’s cancer charity?\nThe allegations involving members of the Trump family and a children’s cancer charity are separate from the New York lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that sought to bar some of the family from running charities in that state.\nAmato’s viral tweet inappropriately conflated the two sets of allegations by claiming that the charity ban (which was requested by the New York attorney general, but not granted by the court) was the result of Trump family members “stealing” from a children’s charity.\nInvestigations by both the Associated Press in 2016 and Forbes in 2017 found that the Eric Trump Foundation had misled donors and mismanaged funds, funneling money into Trump-owned businesses or other charities linked to the Trump empire. \nThe Associated Press, for example, wrote that:\n“A charity operated by one of Donald Trump’s sons flouts philanthropic standards by financially benefiting charities connected to the Trump family and members of the charity’s board, an Associated Press investigation shows. The AP found that Eric Trump has exaggerated the size of his foundation and the donations it receives. At the same time, the charity’s payments for services or donations to other groups repeatedly went to one of Donald Trump’s private golf clubs and to charities linked to the Trumps by corporate, family or philanthropic relationships …”\nAmong other claims, the Associated Press alleged that:\n— The Eric Trump Foundation failed to report multiple conflicts of interest by supposedly independent board members who work for The Trump Organization or Eric Trump’s winery, as required by the IRS.\n— Based on its revenue and giving, the Eric Trump Foundation is a small-to-medium-sized charity. Eric Trump has repeatedly overstated its size. In 2015, for example, he said his group was “one of the largest foundations anywhere in the country, anywhere in the world.” Told of the claim, Associate Dean Patrick Rooney at Indiana University’s Center on Philanthropy said, “That’s just silly.”\n— Though public charity boards are supposed to represent the public, Eric Trump has loaded his board with friends, relatives and Trump employees. They include two Trump company executives who served as senior presidential campaign aides: former Westchester golf club manager Dan Scavino and special Trump counsel Michael D. Cohen. The charity’s executive director, Paige Scardigli, was a close college friend of Eric Trump at Georgetown University.\nThe 2017 Forbes article, which was included in Amato’s widely shared tweet as a source, made similar claims about the operations of the Eric Trump Foundation. Those allegations haven’t been tested in court and have not resulted in any legal action or prosecution.\nIt should also be noted that nobody involved is accused of “stealing,” as such, with that word being understood in the conventional sense of meaning theft or embezzlement of funds. What is alleged is that the foundation engaged in misleading practices and that it inappropriately used donated funds to pay Trump businesses — practices that could be regarded as “self-dealing,” rather than theft or embezzlement.\nIn June 2018, a spokesperson for then-New York Attorney General Underwood told the Associated Press that her office had opened an investigation looking specifically at the affairs of the Eric Trump Foundation and St. Jude’s Research Hospital. We asked the office of Underwood’s successor what the status of that investigation was in October 2019, but we did not receive a response. ",

Three-quarters of receipts made from thermal paper are thought to contain bisphenol A (BPA), a known endocrine disrupter that has been linked to infertility and hormone-related cancers, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Environmental Research.\nTo determine the extent of BPA and its chemical cousin, bisphenol S (BPS), in thermal paper, a team of researchers from the University of Granada (UGR) analyzed more than 100 receipts and tickets collected from Brazil, Spain, and France — an admittedly small sample size. More than 90% of the receipts collected in the former two countries were shown to contain BPA, compared with about half of those obtained in France. However, many receipts in France contained higher concentrations of BPS, which may also impact the endocrine system.\nBPA is an industrial chemical and can be found in a variety of products, including epoxy resins and water bottles. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that BPA exposure and consumption are safe at low levels, yet a growing body of research has linked the chemical to breast cancer, infertility, and obesity. Similarly, BPS has been linked to hormonal-disruption and may trigger the multiplication of breast cancer cells.\nEuropean Union-recommended levels of BPA found in thermal paper should be no more than 0.2mg/g as of the beginning of 2020, according to the UK’s National Health Service. The University of Granada study found that concentration levels of BPA far exceeded that limit. The concentration levels found were:\n“Customers can easily identify these receipts since the ink fades with time and when, for instance, you try to return the trousers that you bought, the shop assistant tells you that they can’t see anything,” said lead study author Nicolás Olea, professor of Medicine at the UGR, in a university press release.\n“Very often the only thing you find is a fine white powder that comes off [the receipts] when you take them out of a handbag or purse. BPA is, precisely, that white powder that sticks to your fingers.”\nIn their study, the researchers concluded that consumers should avoid handling thermal paper receipts until more robust regulations are introduced.",

        "evidence": "In December 2019, readers asked us about reports that claimed the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed changes to the way Social Security disability payments are made, which could cause thousands, even hundreds of thousands, to lose their benefits. \nOn Dec. 12, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Chicago Tribune posted an article with the headline “Trump Administration Proposes Social Security Rule Changes That Could Cut Off Thousands of Disabled Recipients.” The article reported that:\n“The Trump administration is proposing changes to Social Security that could terminate disability payments to hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly older people and children. The new rule would change aspects of disability reviews — the methods by which the Social Security Administration determines whether a person continues to qualify for benefits. Few recipients are aware of the proposal, which is open for public comment through January.”\nThe left-leaning website Common Dreams published an article with the headline “‘A National Disgrace’: Trump Proposes Social Security Change That Could End Disability Benefits for Hundreds of Thousands.'” That story reported:\n“Activists are working to raise public awareness and outrage over a little-noticed Trump administration proposal that could strip life-saving disability benefits from hundreds of thousands of people by further complicating the way the Social Security Administration determines who is eligible for payments.”\nOn the face of it, the changes proposed by the Trump administration would not, in fact, directly or immediately strip disability benefits from thousands of would-be recipients, rather the changes would introduce more (and more frequent) eligibility reviews for those who wish to receive them. However, some critics have argued that those increased bureaucratic requirements would over-burden some would-be recipients, in particular especially vulnerable recipients, and would ultimately (albeit indirectly) result in thousands losing disability benefits. \nThe Social Security Administration distributes disability benefits in two principle ways: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their previous Social Security tax contributions and history of work, and is paid out of the Social Security insurance fund; and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their disability status and inability to work, and is paid out of general tax coffers. \nIn order to prevent potential abuse and waste in the system, the Social Security Administration conducts “continuing disability reviews,” essentially investigating whether each recipient still has a disabling condition, and if so, which kind. Those reviews take place more or less frequently, depending on the nature of each individual’s disability, broken into three “medical diary categories,” as follows:\nIn November, the Social Security Administration published its proposals to make several changes to the review system. The most significant proposal was to add a fourth medical diary category, “Medical Improvement Likely.” Recipients placed in that category would undergo a review every two years.\nAccording to a document accompanying the proposals, the decision to introduce the fourth category was made, in part, because the administration saw a pattern whereby some in the “Medical Improvement Expected” category were being prematurely subjected to re-evaluation, after six-18 months, before a medical improvement had the chance to take hold, and some in the “Medical Improvement Possible” category had successfully treated their impairment comfortably within the three-year review interval.\nThe introduction of the new category would therefore mean the bureaucratic burden on some recipients would actually be lessened, since they would be subject to review less frequently, though clearly it would also mean others would be subject to more frequent reviews. On the whole, the administration has estimated that, between 2020 and 2029, the new category would tend towards requiring more frequent reviews for those currently in the “Medical Improvement Possible” category, rather than less frequent reviews for those currently in the “Medical Improvement Expected” category:\n\nThe administration expects the introduction of the “Medical Improvement Likely” category to lead to an 18 percent increase in the total number of reviews undertaken over the next decade. This would therefore lead to an increased up-front cost in administering the disability benefits programs, and an increased aggregate bureaucratic burden to recipients (even if some individual recipients would actually undergo reviews less frequently). \nGreater scrutiny of individual cases, and enhanced enforcement of eligibility criteria, results in some recipients no longer being deemed eligible, and no longer receiving either SSDI or SSI, which saves money for the Social Security insurance fund and the Treasury, respectively. For the 2015 fiscal year, for example, the Social Security Administration calculated a 19.9:1 return on investment rate for disability benefits enforcement — meaning that for every $1 spent on performing reviews, the government would save $19.90 on disability benefits that would otherwise have been paid, over the course of a lifetime, to recipients who are now deemed ineligible. To be specific, the administration estimated that the $717 million spent on reviews in 2015 would ultimately save $14.3 billion in lifetime disability benefit payments. \nSo the introduction of the Trump administration’s proposals is highly likely to ultimately lead to thousands of disability benefits recipients no longer receiving those benefits — both because some will be overburdened by the bureaucratic demands of more frequent reviews, and because some recipients whose medical status no longer meets the eligibility criteria will have that ineligibility discovered sooner. A considerable measure of truth, therefore, exists in the reports published by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Common Dreams.\nHowever, those articles failed to mention an important component to the administration’s proposals: They would not change how a recipient’s eligibility is determined, only how often that determination takes place. As the proposal stated: “We are not changing the Medical Improvement Review Standard that we use to determine whether a person continues to meet the disability requirements of the Act.”\nThis means that, while the proposed increase in the number and frequency of reviews was highly likely to ultimately cause thousands to lose their benefits, that loss of benefits would not be arbitrary, or based on an application of a new and different standard for determining whether someone’s health has improved. The standards and criteria for assessing whether an improvement has taken place would be the same as currently exist, and only the frequency of those reviews would change.\nIn other words, some recipients would be subject to more frequent reviews, but if those more frequent reviews result in a finding that the recipient still has a qualifying disability or impairment — based on the same criteria as currently apply — the recipient would continue to receive disability benefits. \nIt could be that, as some critics have argued, the proposal represents an elegant way for the administration to save money by removing thousands from the recipient rolls without having to change eligibility criteria — the latter a move that would be more likely to cause public outrage or political opposition. However, on its face at least, the proposal involves enhanced enforcement of existing eligibility standards and criteria. That’s an important distinction, and a significant omission from news articles that reported, with some justification, that the Trump administration had proposed changes to Social Security disability benefits that would cause thousands to be stripped of those benefits. ",

A spokesperson for the non-profit Goodwill Industries International explained in a statement to us that the Goodwill thrift stores familiar to many Americans are not akin to branches of a chain store, governed and overseen by a centralized hierarchy which decides on uniform policies. Rather, they are independent members of a nationwide network of organizations. So while some local Goodwill organizations in California and Oregon had decided to provide assistance of various kinds to victims of the wildfires, these were autonomous decisions, and not a universal policy handed down to all Goodwill locations in those states. As such, it’s quite possible that someone forced to flee the fires would find help, potentially including free blankets, supplies or clothes, at their nearest Goodwill location. However, contrary to the viral meme’s claim, this was not guaranteed for every store, or part of a uniform policy. The spokesperson provided some details of the initiatives being undertaken by some regional Goodwill members.

        "evidence": "Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive officer of online retailing giant Amazon.com, became the world’s richest person in October 2017, according to Forbes magazine. And in January 2018, Bezos’ company opened the first “Amazon Go” — a new kind of store with no checkout required — in Seattle, Washington, to considerable fanfare:Amid a wave of increased press coverage and scrutiny, a viral meme made a number number of claims about Amazon  in January 2018:A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed the fact that the company’s new grocery store, Amazon Go, does not accept SNAP benefits or food stamps as a form of payment.The source of the claim about Amazon workers receiving food stamps was a January 2018 report by the nonprofit group PolicyMatters Ohio, which estimated that roughly 700 Amazon workers in Ohio (more than 10 percent of the company’s employees in the state) receive Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program benefits:PolicyMatters Ohio arrived at that estimate by finding the number of Ohio food stamp recipients who are part of a household where someone works for Amazon (1,430), then dividing that by 2.02 (the average size of a household on food stamps in Ohio at that time). The resulting estimate is about 700 workers, or 11.8 of Amazon’s Ohio workforce. We were unable to find any research or data on Amazon workers’ availing themselves of food stamps in other states. PolicyMatters Ohio sent us figures to corroborate their claims, which they received from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. (That data is available for download in spreadsheet form here.) Further, whether or not an individual qualifies for food stamps is determined by more than just income. Having a gross monthly household income at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty limit is an important factor. However, you can also qualify for SNAP benefits with an income above the poverty limit if someone in your household is disabled or elderly, and the poverty limit is pro-rated depending on the size of your household.Another factor to consider is whether a worker is employed by Amazon on a full-time or part-time basis. Someone whose only source of income was their part-time job at an Amazon fulfillment center would earn a lower monthly income than a full-time worker in a similar position, even if they received the same hourly wage.This circumstance might well qualify someone for food stamps even if their hourly wage at Amazon were otherwise not too bad. In an email, an Amazon spokesperson told us that “Amazon full-time hourly employees in Ohio earn between $14.50 and $15 an hour as a starting wage with regular pay increases plus Amazon stock and performance based bonuses.”On 1 February 2018, Amazon’s jobs web site listed seven open warehouse positions in Ohio. Only one was full-time, a description which a company spokesperson told us entails 40 hours of work per week. The hourly wage for the part-time jobs ranged from $10.50 to $11.75, while a “reduced time” position came with a starting rate of between $14.50 and $17 an hour. The full-time position had a starting hourly wage of between $14.50 and $15.According to a major 2016 report by the non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a group that advocates for more sustainable community development, Amazon’s warehouse workers across 11 metropolitan areas in the United States earned, on average, 15 percent lower than could be expected for a worker in that industry (page 39).Amazon told us this analysis was “flawed,” because it compared Amazon wages with “traditional warehouse jobs and compensation,” claiming  that the appropriate comparison would be between Amazon wages and retail wages, because “that industry more closely resembles the environment of an Amazon fulfillment center.”Additionally, the report’s authors said it was difficult to ascertain exactly what proportion of warehouse workers were on permanent contracts, and what proportion were temps, but estimated (based on news reports and the industry average) that the permanent to temporary ratio was roughly 60/40. A spokesperson for the company gave contradictory figures, saying: “Throughout the year on average, 90 percent of associates across the company’s U.S. fulfillment network are regular, full-time employees. That applies for states like Ohio.” The spokesperson confirmed that “regular” means permanent. The ILSR criticized Amazon for using the label “seasonal” — which has connotations of the annual retail holiday rush — to describe the temporary positions it fills year-round. Amazon has also previously come under fire for what have been described as difficult working conditions. In its 2016 report, the ILSR summarized employment at the company’s fulfillment centers as “grueling work for lower pay than average”:In response to these descriptions, a spokesperson for the company told us:While the meme says that Amazon grossed $128 billion in sales “last year,” that number is not quite accurate. For one thing, Amazon’s 2017 earnings had not yet been published in January 2018, when the meme was created. Instead, Grit Post, where the meme appears to have originated, said in a list of sources that they had used Amazon’s 2016 numbers. Amazon actually had net (not gross) sales of $136 billion in 2016, according to the company’s full year financial results. This means gross sales (which were not reported) were even higher than that, and certainly higher than the $128 billion claimed in the meme.  Amazon’s sales for 2017 are likely to be astronomical.Based on the company’s predictions for the final three months of the year, Amazon’s full-year net sales in 2017 might reach around $178 billion. ",

        "evidence": "On 16 September 2018, Christine Blasey Ford identified herself publicly as the woman who wrote a confidential letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in the presence of his classmate Mark Judge, had sexually assaulted her in the 1980s when he was a student at Georgetown Prep, leading to tense negotiations about if and when Ford would testify before the Judiciary Committee. Following Blasey Ford’s disclosure, several attempts were made to insinuate that Blasey Ford had confused Kavanaugh with another man, something she categorically denied as a possibility.The first prominent presentation of this argument was offered in a now-deleted, defamatory, and false Twitter thread from Ed Whelan, the president (currently on leave) of the conservative think tank the Ethics and Public Policy Center. In a series of Tweets, Whelan utilized comments left on Facebook posts, floor plans found on the real estate website Zillow, and yearbook photographs to accuse (by name) another Georgetown Prep classmate of the assault, based primarily on his physical similarities with a young Kavanaugh. Through her lawyers, Blasey Ford dismissed this possibility:Whelan later apologized for the incident and was placed on a leave of absence from the Ethics and Public Policy Center.“I made an appalling and inexcusable mistake of judgment in posting the tweet thread in a way that identified Kavanaugh’s Georgetown Prep classmate,” Mr. Whelan Tweeted on 21 September 2018. “I take full responsibility for that mistake, and I deeply apologize for it. I realize that does not undo the mistake.”On 26 September 2018, the night before Blasey Ford was scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, committee chair Chuck Grassley released a report that had the effect of suggesting, for a second time, that Blasey Ford’s memories were confused. According to this report, between 24 and 26 September 2018, two separate men reached out to the committee claiming that they were in fact the person who assaulted Blasey Ford. The report, a timeline of investigative actions which Grassley maintained his committee undertook, included three references to these two individuals:The allegations made by these men, though offered “in some detail” in one case, have not been publicly outlined, and it is not clear if both of these men allege themselves to be the primary assailant, or if one of them alleges to have been the second man in the room at the time of the assault. For obvious reasons, both men cannot be correct if they both assert to be the person allegedly confused for Brett Kavanaugh.On 27 September 2018, during her sworn testimony, Ford was asked several times under oath if she could have confused Kavanaugh for someone else, and each time she emphatically and categorically denied such a possibility, first in an exchange with Senator Feinstein:In an exchange with Senator Patrick Leahy, Ford reiterated this point and provided additional information about the person whom Ed Whelan falsely accused of the assault, indicating she knew this other man well at that time:In response to a question from Senator Dick Durbin about her level of certainty that Kavanaugh was the assailant, Dr. Ford said she was 100% certain:No additional information has yet been made available regarding the claims put forward by the two men interviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee staff.",

Discussions that attempt to equate pedophilia with sexual orientation have been contentious, primarily because of the false belief that members of the LGBT community are predisposed to child molestation. Those who argue against civil rights for the LGBT community often cast those rights as a slippery slope to legalizing child sexual abuse or bestiality.TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) did not deny the controversial talk took place, but they noted in a 20 June 2018 statement that TEDx talks are “are organized independently from the main annual TED conference” and that the video had been removed at Heine’s request because “she had serious concerns about her own safety in its wake” and Heine cited “research in ways that are open to serious misinterpretation”:In mid-July 2018, several websites were taken in by a viral hoax that reported pedophiles or “minor-attracted person” (MAPs) were attempting to join the LGBT community and had created their own Pride flag.

Kimberly Daniels garnered national attention for introducing legislation that would require public schools throughout the state to prominently display the U.S. motto “In God We Trust”:Daniels’ bill was passed by the Florida House, but it failed to clear the Senate Education Committee. However, the “In God We Trust” requirement was later included in a spending bill signed into law by Republican governor Rick Scott in March 2018.The focus on Daniels’ proposal prompted scrutiny of her own controversial background as a Christian pastor who preached about demonic possession, claimed that Halloween candy was “prayed over by witches,” and virulently opposed inclusiveness towards the LGBT community.In March 2018, the website Patheos drew attention to one explosive proclamation of Daniels’ in particular, reported in an article headlined “Black Florida Lawmaker Thanks God for Slavery”:That article cited an earlier Facebook video posted by the Freedom from Religion Foundation:The quotation is authentic. In 2008, Daniels delivered a guest sermon at the Solid Rock Church in Monroe, Ohio. The description under a YouTube video of the sermon states that it took place in October 2008.

        "evidence": "In August 2018, several news outlets around the world reported on a rare sexually-transmitted infection contracted by a woman in England, offering that information under scary-sounding headlines which raised the specter of a “flesh-eating STD” running rampant.Fox affiliates WFLD (in Chicago) and WTTG (in Washington D.C.) both reported “‘Flesh-eating’ STD allegedly making the rounds,” while the network’s Rockford, Illinois, affiliate WQRF went with the grammatically challenged “‘Flesh-eating’ STD causes genitals to ‘rot away’ making the rounds.”These headlines created the impression that an unusually dangerous or gruesome STD was increasing in its virality or prevalence. Perhaps the most egregious example of this representation came from San Francisco ABC affiliate KGO-TV, which offered the headline “Researchers warn of resurgence of flesh eating STD after it’s found in England”:Neither KGO-TV’s article nor the accompanying video segment provided any details about the purported “warning” or the “researchers” who had supposedly given it, nor any explanation of what was meant by a “resurgence” of the disease or the claim that it was “making a comeback.”The basis of these sensationalized reports was a 22 August article from the English  newspaper, which read as follows:This original article gave the reader plenty of important context, much of it missing from subsequent reporting by U.S. news outlets.Firstly, the disease is “super-rare,” and the basis of the article is a single diagnosis, itself apparently unprecedented in the U.K.So not only did U.S. news reports mislead viewers and readers by claiming “researchers” had “warned” about the disease (donovanosis), but they did so on the basis of just one diagnosis of a person living in Southport, near Liverpool — thousands of miles away from those news outlets’ American audiences.As for claims that donovanosis is “making the rounds” or that a “resurgence” in the spread of the disease has occurred, nothing in the original  report (or anywhere else) supported those contentions.Any claim that a disease is becoming more prevalent or undergoing a “resurgence” must first provide data to demonstrate what its prevalence was during an earlier period of time, and then make a methodologically robust comparison with its prevalence during a more recent period of time. It must also clearly explain the geographical area or areas in which this putative resurgence is taking place.A single (apparently unprecedented) diagnosis of a disease in England does not constitute a trend, and certainly not one with any epidemiological implications for viewers in Illinois, Washington, D.C., and California.Second, the  article provided some context on what was meant by “flesh-eating.” As  noted, “‘Flesh-eating’ is just a scary way of saying an infection is destroying tissue.” In this case, the disease (donovanosis) only begins to destroy healthy tissue (i.e., becomes “flesh-eating”) if ulcers attendant with it are left untreated and allowed to spread:According to the Centers for Disease Control, the treatment of donovanosis (also known as ) can be tricky, consisting of at least three weeks on oral antibiotics with the possibility of relapse after between six and eighteen months.However, serious destruction of tissue is not a necessary consequence of being infected with donovanosis. So the “flesh-eating STD” which formed the basis of so many frightening news reports and headlines in August 2018 was only “flesh-eating” under certain uncommon and preventable circumstances. Nothing in the original  article established that the infection actually reached this stage in the single case of the woman they reported on.While readers should of course take the usual precautions in order to protect themselves and others from contracting any sexually-transmitted diseases, the manner in which several U.S. news outlets described a single diagnosis of donovanosis in England had the effect of sensationalizing the implications for the public and included some elements of misleading or erroneous misinformation.",

        "evidence": "In June and July 2020, ahead of the presidential elections, Democratic candidate Joe Biden’s various policy platforms were picked apart and in some cases misrepresented by critics, including U.S. President Donald Trump. One particular statement Biden made about health care for so-called “undocumented” immigrants was misreported and presented without context as his policy.\nSnopes readers asked us if Biden had ever said that U.S. taxpayers had an “obligation” to pay for the health care of 11 million “illegal immigrants.” We found that Biden was misquoted, and his actual platform said something very different.\n\nThe quote appeared to originate from a clip shared by right-wing media organization BlazeTV, in May 2019. The video carried the title, “Joe Biden Says U.S. Obligated to Give Free Healthcare to ‘Undocumented’ Immigrants.”\nIn the clip, a reporter asked Biden, “Do you think the undocumented immigrants…[that] are law abiding, should be entitled to federal benefits, Medicare, Medicaid for example?” Biden responded:\n“Look I think that anyone who is in a situation where they’re in need of healthcare, regardless of whether they’re documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they’re cared for. That’s why I think we need more clinics around the country.”\nBiden echoed this in the June 2019 Democratic presidential debates. And in a December 2019 interview with Telemundo, he laid out the caveats in his plan: “They can buy into the system like everyone else” under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). \nOn July 14, 2020, in a rambling speech, Trump misrepresented Biden’s policy after it was presented by the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces. Trump said: “They want government health care for all illegal aliens.”\nBut here’s what the task force actually recommended:\n“To ensure that people living and working across the country have health care access, the Task Force recommends extending Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients, allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase unsubsidized coverage in the ACA marketplaces …”\nUnder this proposal, taxpayers would not be paying for undocumented immigrants’ health care, rather undocumented immigrants could have the option to pay out-of-pocket for health coverage through the ACA exchange marketplace, but without access to the government subsidies that are available to others.\nIn 2019 Brookings estimated that there are 10.5 to 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Currently, they cannot enroll in Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or purchase insurance through the ACA marketplace. Some state-funded or locally-funded health programs provide coverage regardless of immigration status. Emergency health services and safety-net clinics are already available to undocumented immigrants, which Biden had advocated for before. \nIn summary, even though Biden did state that the U.S. had an obligation to ensure immigrants received health care, his views were largely misrepresented and did not reflect his current policy. While he would extend health care access to undocumented immigrants through the marketplace, it was far from the government-subsidized, taxpayer-funded plan it was made out to be by Trump. We thus rate this claim as “Mostly False.”",

        "evidence": "In April 2019, Washington state Sen. Maureen Walsh attracted local and national attention — and criticism — for remarks she made during a debate about legislation intended to improve nurses’ working conditions.On 19 April, the website Nurse.org posted a widely shared article whose headline read: “Senator Remarks Go Viral: Nurses ‘Play Cards for a Considerable Amount of the Day.'” The article went on:Walsh did say, of nurses in certain hospitals, that they “probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day,” and she has since said she regrets having done so. However, she made her remarks in a very specific context, and was not referring to all nurses everywhere, despite the impression given in much subsequent commentary and reporting. The Walla Walla senator was speaking during a Washington Senate floor debate on 16 April, on the subject of SHB 1155, a piece of legislation that would require health-care providers to give clinical employees uninterrupted meal and rest breaks during their shifts, except in emergencies.More specifically, Walsh was speaking in support of Amendment 724, which was put forward by her Republican colleague State Sen. Curtis King. That amendment would exempt a certain category of hospitals (Critical Access Hospitals) from the requirements of the bill.Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) are smaller, typically rural hospitals with fewer than 25 in-patient beds that are legally designated as CAHs by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Because they typically serve relatively isolated rural communities, they receive certain financial support and benefits from the federal government in order to ensure their ongoing sustainability. Walsh supported the proposed exemption of CAHs from the meal and rest-break requirements in SHB 1155, arguing that staff there were not typically as busy as their counterparts in other hospitals, and therefore did not require such mandatory regular breaks. In the interest of completeness, here are Walsh’s remarks in full, which can also be watched here (beginning at around 9:10):In a statement sent to Snopes, the Washington State Nurses Association rejected one of the premises of Walsh’s call for CAHs to be exempted from the proposed new requirements, arguing that, far from being in grave financial danger, “the majority of these small, rural hospitals are financially healthy and well equipped to implement SHB 1155’s patient safety standards,” adding that: “Over the last four years of reports, the total net income (surplus) for Washington’s 40 critical access hospitals is $208,657,776, with an average surplus of $5,216,444 per hospital.When one views Walsh’s remarks in their full and proper context, it’s clear that her “playing cards” comment related specifically to nurses in CAHs (“those nurses”). She was not claiming that all nurses everywhere spend much of their working days playing cards.This is in contrast to the impression created by much of the subsequent coverage of her remarks. For example, Nurse.org summarized her remarks as “Nurses ‘play cards for a considerable amount of the day,'” without reflecting that Walsh was actually describing only a relatively small subcategory of nurses.On 19 April, Juliana Bindas started an online petition on Change.org that called for Walsh to follow a nurse around during a 12-hour shift. The text that accompanied the petition (which had more than 500,000 signatures as of 22 April) also provided a misleading characterization of the senator’s comments, claiming “Senator Maureen Walsh stated that we as nurses mostly spend our 12 hour shifts playing cards.”Similarly, many online memes and social media responses markedly failed to recognize that Walsh’s remarks had referred to a specific cohort of nurses, and not all nurses in every context. Headlines published by major national news outlets including CNN and The Hill also failed to reflect the specific context of Walsh’s comments, instead giving the misleading impression she had been talking about all nurses.On 20 April, Walsh told the  newspaper she regretted her comments, saying “I was tired. I said something I wish I hadn’t.” In a statement provided to the local KEPR television station, the state senator elaborated further and clarified that her remarks were indeed specifically in reference to nurses at CAHs:“My Mother was [a registered nurse] for many years and I have the greatest respect for nurses. The comment made about the ability to play cards was referring to the staff at the very rural and small critical access hospitals who may only serve a handful of patients and [where] the staffing mandates are unnecessary.”On 16 April, the Washington State Senate passed Amendment 724, along with the revised version of SHB 1155, which subsequently included an exemption for CAHs. In the House, a different version of the bill had already been passed, meaning the legislation was scheduled for reconciliation between the two chambers, as of 22 April.",

        "evidence": "In late October 2018, as a caravan of Central American migrants from Honduras made its way into Mexico toward the United States border, some social media users took at face value a simplistic meme reporting that the famed 82nd Airborne Division had received word of deployment to the U.S.-Mexico border in response to the caravan:Pentagon spokesman Capt. Bill Speaks confirmed to us that a contingent has been sent to the border from Fort Bragg, The 82nd Airborne’s 2nd Assault Helicopter Battalion deployed as part of what has been dubbed Operation Faithful Patriot.According to the , the 82nd Airborne “includes approximately 18,000 soldiers at Fort Bragg, trains to deploy on short notice. Its paratroopers form the core of the nation’s Global Response Force, which is postured to respond anywhere in the world in a matter of hours.”President Donald Trump said he would send the military to the border to stop a dwindling group of migrants, who are fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries, from entering the United States. On 22 October 2018 he tweeted that he had notified the U.S. military and U.S. Border Patrol of a “national emergency” while making an unfounded claim that “unknown Middle Easterners” were traveling with the caravan:When asked during an exclusive interview that same day with  how many troops he might send, Trump responded, “As many as necessary.” But the Pentagon also said the same day that they had received no such orders.The Associated Press reported Trump administration officials to be at loggerheads over how to respond to the caravan:As many as 8,000 soldiers could soon join roughly 2,100 unarmed National Guard troops, mainly from Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona, dispatched to the border in a non-law enforcement capacity performing roles supporting the operations of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. The specific rumor that Trump had ordered the 82nd Airborne, an elite Army division to the U.S.-Mexico border may have originated with white supremacist Hal Turner. Without citing any sources, Turner reported on 22 October 2018 that:Turner, who in 2010 was sentenced to 33 months in prison for threatening to kill three federal judges, also called for deadly violence when the caravan arrived at the border, writing: “Prepare yourselves mentally for the reality that we may have to gun down these people.

        "evidence": "In 2019, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachussetts began to resile from previous statements she had made about her Native American ancestry, a source of criticism that had been used against her since she first ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012.During that 2012 campaign, the  revealed that Warren had listed herself as a member of a racial or ethnic minority in a directory of law professors between 1985 and 1996, after it emerged that Harvard Law School, where she taught from 1995 to 2011, had publicly described her as a Native American during her tenure there. (In 2018, dozens of Warren’s colleagues over her decades as a law professor told the  that perceptions of her Native American ancestry had played no role in her rise through the ranks of legal academia.)In reality, Warren has very little Native American ancestry (albeit more than the average American of European origins), but her public pronouncements, including professing herself to be “very proud” of her heritage, have attracted criticism and even ridicule since 2012. President Donald Trump routinely refers to the Democratic senator with the mocking epithet “Pocahontas” and on one occasion offered to pay $1 million to a charity of Warren’s choice if she could demonstrate Native American ancestry.Warren did just that in October 2018, when she published the results of a DNA test which concluded that the “vast majority” of her ancestry was European but that her lineage was very likely to include one Native American ancestor somewhere between six and 10 generations ago.The DNA test engendered further controversy, and Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. strongly criticized Warren’s actions, writing in a statement that “Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. It makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is proven. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.”On 31 December 2018, Warren announced she was launching an exploratory committee for a 2020 presidential campaign and was widely expected to formally declare her candidacy for that office in early 2019.Against that background, the high-profile Democrat began in February 2019 to step back from her earlier public statements about her Native American ancestry.First, the Cherokee Nation revealed that Warren had contacted tribal leaders and apologized for touting the results of her DNA test as evidence of her Native American ancestry. Then on 5 February, the  reported that Warren had issued a significantly expanded statement, apologizing for describing herself as Native American for many years:The revelation that Warren had personally described herself as “American Indian,” in her own handwriting, formed the basis of widespread news reports on 5 and 6 February 2019 and prompted enquiries from Snopes readers about the authenticity of the document described by the .We can confirm that the document is authentic.

Lacking sources and dates, that article was itself an aggregation of earlier news reports about a real incident that took place in February 2018 at Ingwelala, near Kruger National Park close to South Africa’s north-eastern border with Mozambique.On 12 February, the Agence France-Press (AFP) news agency reported the basic outlines of the story:The South African news web site Eyewitness News (EWN) stated that police had found a rifle and ammunition next to the man’s remains, leading to the suspicion that he was a would-be poacher.The Times Live news web site later reported that Ngoepe had identified the man as 50-year-old David Baloyi from Mavodze in Mozambique, which is 50 miles away from the South African nature reserve where he died.Despite the headlines used by the Voyager Channel and Southland Post, however, no evidence documented that Baloyi had killed a lion cub before being attacked.The February 2018 death of David Baloyi is not to be confused with a similar (but unrelated) lion attack that took place four months later and also gained the attention of the news media worldwide.

        "evidence": "On 1 May 2019, the scientific journal  published research that found, among other things, the presence of cocaine in “100% of samples” of freshwater shrimp () from 15 sites across Suffolk, UK. The purpose of the study, titled “Biomonitoring of pesticides, pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in a freshwater invertebrate to estimate toxic or effect pressure” was two-fold: to present a method for quantifying the presence of pesticide, pharmaceutical, and drugs of abuse in ecological settings, and to develop methods to estimate the relative amount of harm, or effect, each of these chemicals poses to the organisms in those environments.In a press release, lead author Thomas Miller, a post-doctoral researcher at King’s College London, said, “The most frequently detected compounds were illicit drugs, including cocaine and ketamine, and a banned pesticide, fenuron.” The investigators were able to identify 56 compounds among the shrimp samples. The researchers also sampled the water in the streams in which the shrimp were found. Here, too, cocaine was identified in all of the sites, suggesting its occurrence is widespread and not localized to any one source of contamination. The concentrations, however, were “generally very low”:Speaking to NPR, Emma Rosi, who was not involved in this study but who has, as an aquatic ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, performed similar work, said: “Pharmaceuticals and personal care products and pesticides and these types of illicit drugs have been detected in surface waters all over the world, because when we use them, our waste isn’t always treated properly, and so they come out in rivers and streams.” Rossi’s past work has identified more than 60 pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic invertebrates and spiders in streams near Melbourne, Australia.The question of what effect these compounds have on the organisms studied is a different one. Previous studies have, for example, attempted to ascertain if the behavior or other attributes of minnows exposed to concentrations of antidepressants found in some bodies of water changed as a result of that exposure. One study demonstrated that minnows’ “larval survival behaviors are imperiled by their current environmental exposure to antidepressant mixtures,” and that “anatomical variations in body length were also produced.” Another study by the same researchers found that minnows’ “anatomy and physiology, but not reproductive behavior, can be disrupted by exposure to environmental concentrations of some antidepressants.”In the shrimp study, the researchers attempted to quantify the potential effect on shrimp using a different quantitative measure based on the toxicity of the various chemicals at issue. For nearly all of the chemicals, including cocaine, they concluded that, “The potential for any effect is likely to be low.” Still, the presence of any illicit drugs in these shrimp was surprising to the researchers. Leon Barron, a co-author on the study from King’s College, said: “Such regular occurrence of illicit drugs in wildlife was surprising. We might expect to see these in urban areas such as London, but not in smaller and more rural catchments.”Nic Bury, another co-author from the University of Suffolk, argued that, “The impact of ‘invisible’ chemical pollution (such as drugs) on wildlife health needs more focus in the UK as policy can often be informed by studies such as these.” Their study provided refined methodologies to answer these kinds of questions. It also, as headlines claimed, identified the presence of cocaine in freshwater shrimp. As such, we rank the claim “true.”",

        "evidence": "In June 2020, Snopes received numerous inquires from readers wondering if mixing Dawn dish soap with Clorox bleach products during household cleaning sprees could emit a toxic gas that would kill them.\nThe question largely seemed to stem from social media posts and blog entries suggesting that that brand of dish soap contained ammonia and, when mixed with bleach, could create hazardous fumes. One Michigan-based DIY lifestyle blogger wrote:\nLast week I was researching some unexpected homemade stain removers and that got me thinking about another homemade laundry product – my homemade no-grate laundry soap made with Dawn dish soap. …BUT – not that long ago when I looked at the back of the bottle of Dawn dish soap I spotted these tiny words:  “Do Not Add Bleach”. .. Apparently the warnings found on some dish soaps that you should not add bleach stems from this potential chemical reaction [of ammonia and bleach].\n\nUpon our analysis of similar blog entries and posts, we determined the most popular claim to be this: Dawn dish soap contains ammonia even though it’s not listed as an ingredient, and when mixed with Clorox bleach products, the results could be lethal.\nFirstly, to investigate the assertion, let this be known: ammonia, a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen (NH₃), is a colorless gas with a distinct, suffocating odor. It dissolves easily in water to create ammonium hydroxide, which is commonly used in low concentration to make a variety of household and industrial-strength cleaning products, specifically some glass and window cleaners.\nSodium hypochlorite is the active ingredient in chlorine bleach and is similarly diluted and mixed with other ingredients to make several household disinfectants, including many Clorox products for stain and soil cleaning.\nAnd when bleach is mixed with ammonia, yes, a toxic gas called chloramine is released into the air and can cause the following symptoms for people who breathe it in, according to the Washington State Department of Health:\nAnd in high concentrations, the gas can force people into comas or be deadly. Clorox states on its website:\nBleach and ammonia should NEVER be mixed since when the two combine, toxic gas is formed that could be fatal.  And it’s not just ammonia or products containing ammonia (like window cleaner) that can be a problem. Therefore, as a general rule, bleach should not be mixed with other household cleaners such as toilet bowl cleaners, rust removers, and acids (vinegar, for example) since toxic gas can also form.\n(If you do accidentally mix bleach and ammonia and feel one or more of the above-listed symptoms, immediately leave the contaminated area and call 911 or the American Association of Poison Control Centers 1-800-222-1222.)\nNow, we move on to the part of the claim regarding the composition and ingredient lists for Dawn dish soap. To determine whether the soaps contain ammonia and, therefore, should not be mixed with Clorox bleach products, we reviewed dozens of Safety Data Sheets — which outline product ingredient information as part of the United Nation’s system for classifying and labeling chemicals — for the following types of soap:\nDawn Ultra Lemon, Ultra Dawn Original, Ultra Dawn Peach Sunrise, Dawn Ultra Plus Heavy Duty, Dawn Simply Clean Original, Dawn Ultra Berry Time Blast, Dawn Original Non-Concentrated, Dawn Ultra Plus Advanced Power, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Lavender, Ultra Dawn Free and Gentle, Dawn Simply Clean Apple Blossom, Dawn Ultra Antibacterial Orange, Dawn Ultra Pomegranate Awakening, Dawn Ultra Apple Orchard Harvest, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Aloe Water, Dawn Professional Dish Detergent, Ultra Dawn Platinum Vibrant Fresh, Ultra Dawn Platinum Advanced Power, Dawn Apple Blossom Non-Concentrated, Ultra Dawn Platinum Advanced Power, Dawn Pure Essentials Lavender Wisp, Dawn Pure Essentials Lemon Essence, Ultra Dawn Platinum Refreshing Rain, Dawn Simply Clean Summertime Showers, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Cherry Blossom, Ultra Dawn Escapes Malibu Sunrise, Ultra Dawn Escapes Fuji Cherry Blossom, Dawn Ultra Antibacterial Apple Blossom, Dawn Pure Essentials Lavender Wisp, Dawn Summertime Showers Non-Concentrated, Ultra Dawn Escapes Thai Dragonfruit, Ultra Dawn Escapes Caribbean Breeze, Dawn Platinum Erasing Foam Fresh Rapids, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Hawaiian Pineapple, Dawn Powerwash Dish Spray – Apple, Dawn Ultra Power Dissolver, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Peach and Almond, Ultra Dawn Antibacterial Hand Soap Orange, Ultra Dawn Escapes Hawaiian Pineapple, Dawn Ultra Botanicals New Zealand Springs, Ultra Dawn Pure Essentials Sparkling Mist, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Fuji Cherry Blossom, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Pomegranate Splash, Ultra Dawn Hand Renewal Cucumber and Melon, Ultra Dawn Escapes New Zealand Springs, Ultra Dawn Platinum Oxi Invigorating Berry, Dawn Ultra Plus Power Clean Refreshing Rain, Dawn Platinum Dishwashing Foam Fresh Rapids, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Green Tea and Honey, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Mediterranean Lavender, Dawn Ultra Total Clean – Pomegranate Awakening, Dawn Ultra Platinum Stainfighter Lemon Burst, Ultra Dawn Escapes Mediterranean Lavender, Bounty with Dawn, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray Apple Scent, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray Fresh Scent, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray Citrus Scent, Ultra Dawn Antibacterial Hand Soap Apple Blossom, Cascade Advanced Power Dishwasher Powder with Dawn, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Pomegranate And Rose Water, Ultra Dawn Platinum Bleach Alternative Morning Mist, Dawn Hand Renewal with Olay Cool Springs, Dawn Hand Renewal with Olay Refreshing Mint, Dawn Ultra Plus Hand Renewal Waterfall Mist, Dawn Professional Multi-Surface Heavy Duty Degreaser Concentrate, Mr. Clean Liquid Muscle Multi-Purpose Cleaner with the Power of Dawn, Dawn Professional Manual Pot and Pan Detergent Lemon Scent – Concentrate, Dawn Wash Away Bacteria Dishwashing Liquid Hand Soap Lemon, Dawn Platinum Bleach Alternative Dishwashing Liquid Fresh Rapids, and Dawn Platinum Bleach Stain Fighter Dishwashing Liquid, Lemon Burst\nNone of the documents listed any form of ammonia as part of Dawn products’ composition or ingredients, which means it is false to assert that the dish cleaners contain the compound that causes a toxic gas when mixed with bleach. Additionally, it’s false to claim that Dawn is nefariously putting ammonia in its products while omitting it from ingredient lists. \nSupporting our analysis of the Safety Data Sheets, a representative Proctor & Gamble, which owns the Dawn brand, told Snopes via email:\nDawn dish soap is not formulated using ammonia. That does not mean it should ever be combined with other cleaning products. In general, combining two cleaning products can cause harmful reactions, so like all cleaning products, we always recommend using Dawn by itself to get the job done. \nPublic health officials ask people to heed similar advice in regards to DIY cleaning concoctions. The Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) states on its website: “avoid mixing chemical products” and “never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser”.\nIn sum, since mixing bleach and ammonia can be deadly, it’s accurate to state that people should not combine Clorox bleach products with cleaners that contain ammonia; however, it is false to assert that Dawn dish soaps contain ammonia and/or that the company is nefariously leaving the compound off ingredient lists. For those reasons, we rate this claim a “Mixture” of true and untrue information. ",

        "evidence": "In May 2019, Joe Biden, former U.S. vice president and 2020 presidential candidate, came under renewed scrutiny for purportedly saying he had “no empathy” for the plight of younger people. On 2 May, the Twitter account @IbrahimAS97 posted a 16-second video of Biden on a stage and in conversation with an interviewer. The tweet contained the following excerpted quote: “The younger generation now tells me how tough things are, give me a break … I have no empathy,” while the video featured a longer portion of Biden’s remarks:“… And so, the younger generation now tells me how tough things are — give me a break! [Audience laughs and applauds]. No no, I have no empathy for it. Give me a break. Because here’s the deal, guys — we decided we were going to change the world, and we did. We did …”The viral spread of @IbrahimAS97’s tweet in May 2019 prompted several Snopes readers to inquire about any wider context or meaning behind Biden’s comments.Biden did indeed say he had “no empathy” for the plight of younger people, but he was not speaking in general or absolute terms. Rather, he was making a specific, emphatic comparison between the relative progress and civility of the present moment, on one hand, and the upheaval and civil discord of his own youth, in the late 1960s. That important context was not shown in the viral 16-second clip posted to Twitter by @IbrahimAS97.The former vice president made the remarks in question on 10 January 2018, during his appearance at the  “Ideas Exchange” at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. His appearance was partly centered around his book “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose.”The  published an edited, two-minute video excerpt of Biden’s conversation with columnist and author Pat Morrison. It’s not clear what immediately preceded and followed those portions of the discussion, although the interview appears to have been wide-ranging and eclectic, according to two reports published by the  afterwards. The following is a transcript of the edited exchanges shown in that two-minute clip:We were not able to obtain any more footage from Biden and Morrison’s conversation, but based on a summary of the event that the  subsequently published, there does not appear to have been anything within the discussion which would alter the meaning or sense of Biden’s “empathy” remarks. As shown in @IbrahimAS97’s viral May 2019 video, Biden  say he had “no empathy” for the plight of younger people. However, the 16-second clip did  show the former vice president making a specific, emphatic comparison between the relative calm of the present moment and the social and political tumult of his own youth in the late 1960s. He was not saying, in absolute or general terms, that he had no empathy for younger people.In omitting this important context, IbrahimAS97’s video gives an incomplete and somewhat misleading presentation of what Biden actually said. Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign declined to comment for this fact check.",

        "evidence": "When long-time political operative Roger Stone was arrested on 25 January 2019 in a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Special Counsel-led investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, many pundits were quick to draw parallels between Stone’s involvement in the campaigns of both presidents Donald Trump and Richard Nixon. Nixon is perhaps best known for becoming the first president to resign, under the cloud of impeachment in 1974.But the parallels drawn in news stories were ones that the Nixon Foundation, the charitable organization founded by the 37th president, was eager to debunk. Taking to social media, the Nixon Foundation said that Stone had a minimal role in Nixon’s campaigns for election and re-election in 1968 and 1972:Stone was charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office with seven counts, including lying to Congress, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering. A political adviser, public supporter and campaign insider to Donald Trump, Stone also has an image of Nixon tattooed on his back and made Nixon’s characteristic “victory” gesture upon leaving court after being indicted.Despite his young age and limited official capacity in Nixon’s 1972 re-election campaign, Stone managed to play a consequential role in that event, earning an early reputation as a master of dirty political tricks.Timothy Naftali, historian and founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California, pointed out that Stone had a much more involved role in Nixon’s 1972 re-election campaign than the Nixon Foundation let on. Writing for the , Naftali stated that:Nixon became the first U.S. president to resign from office on 9 August 1974, amid the Watergate scandal, dwindling public approval, and the looming prospect of impeachment. Because of the criminal investigations surrounding his campaign and a parade of scandals plaguing his presidency, Trump has drawn Nixonian comparisons that go beyond Stone’s involvement in both candidates’ campaigns.Nixon fired a series of DOJ officials in order to get rid of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, in an event known historically as the “Saturday Night Massacre.” When Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on 9 May 2017, sparking the appointment of Robert Mueller, the Nixon Presidential Library tweeted a humorous homage to Nixon:",

        "evidence": "In mid-December 2017, a viral story picked up by multiple news outlets and web sites reported that United Parcel Service (UPS) refunded a $32 shipment fee to a family waiting for a $846,000 bank draft that never arrived:The story was first reported by Canadian network CBC on 14 December 2017 and although the first part of the story has been reported and aggregated by various outlets far and wide, the situation was resolved almost immediately when the bank issued the family a new check after the CBC story was published ten months after the ordeal began.In February 2017, Ontario, Canada resident Lorette Taylor was distributing inheritance money to her two siblings and when she went to her TD Canada Trust branch, her family was told that the best way to send $846,648.46 to her brother was by bank draft (i.e., a check issued directly by a bank). Taylor told CBC that the branch assured her there was a procedure in place to recover the money if the draft was lost or stolen.Taylor’s brother, Louis Paul Herbert, lives 273 miles from the family’s attorney’s office and told CBC he thought he could save himself the long drive by having UPS ship the money to a nearby UPS store, but UPS lost the package carrying the funds. The family wrangled with the bank over the issue for almost a year and finally approached CBC in desperation. Their plan to make their plight public worked: soon after the Canadian news agency broke the story, the bank issued the family a new check, resolving the situation.TD Canada Trust spokeswoman Barbara Timmins assured us on 27 December 2017 that the family has received a replacement check and the situation has been resolved, saying: “We recognize that there was more we could have done to come to a resolution faster.”Many of the headlines being shared by various publications seem geared to generate outrage clicks aimed at UPS, and are worded more or less like this one in the : “After losing family’s $846K inheritance, UPS offers to refund $32 shipping fee.”It is unclear why UPS should have been the target of outrage in this instance, as they didn’t issue the check and had no authority or responsibility to provide a replacement. After searching unsuccessfully for the package, UPS sent the family a letter of apology and reimbursed their shipping costs, in accordance with the company’s terms and conditions of service (which plainly state that customers are prohibited from shipping items worth more than $50,000). Furthermore, unless customers take specific actions to inform them, UPS employees usually have no way of knowing what is in packages they are delivering.In the CBC story, Herbert expressed remorse for having the money sent via UPS rather than picking it up himself, saying that “I should have just driven [to the lawyer’s office]. It’s something I kick myself in the rear over everyday.”In response to the incident, UPS sent out a statement that read:Timmins said the case has illustrated that many people don’t understand how bank drafts work. He noted that they do not expire and should be handled like cash in explaining why the bank was hesitant to reissue a new one after the original was lost:",

        "evidence": "We received multiple reader inquiries in December 2019 about news reports that claimed a man in Kampala, Uganda, had been hired by mosquito repellent companies because, according to him, they were interested in studying how his flatulence purportedly kills mosquitoes. \nOn Dec. 10, the U.K. tabloid newspaper The Sun published an article with the headline “Man Whose Deadly Farts ‘Can Kill Mosquitoes Hired to Create Mosquito Repellent Made From His Intestinal Gas.'” The article reported that:\n“A man whose farts kill mosquitoes claims to have been signed up by insect repellent companies probing the secret of his killer gas. Joe Rwamirama, 48, from Kampala, Uganda says boffins have launched a study into the chemical properties of his unique trouser toxin. The odd job man says no one in his home village has ever contracted malaria because his powers knock out insects over a six mile radius. If true, that would make his fallout zone larger than that of the atomic bomb which destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.”\nThe Sun’s article also included purported quotations from a “local barber” and a “local chief”:\n“Local barber James Yoweri said: ‘He is known all over the city as the man who can kill mosquitoes with his farts. When Joe is around we all know that mosquitoes will vanish. He is respectful of people around him and will only fart when there are mosquitoes around which bring malaria. His farts gets rid of this disease.’\n“A Local chief who knew Joe, when he was growing up as a child, said he took him in to live with him during the malaria season and claimed no one nearby caught the disease. The chief said: ‘I heard about Joe’s gift and I took him in to help mop out the mosquitoes infesting our surroundings. He respectfully drops these bloomers and it helped eradicate the insects. He does his thing and they drop – like flies.'”\nSimilar stories were published by other U.K. tabloids the Daily Mirror and Daily Star, and in several countries around the world, including Denmark, Germany, Croatia, Ecuador, and India. BBC Somali and the New Zealand Herald also published stories on “Joe Rwamirama’s” legendary flatulence, as did the U.S.-based websites Barstool Sports and RedState.  \nHowever, the entire episode was a hoax. The Rwamirama story first emerged on Dec. 9 on the website Ihlayanews. The site’s header contains the disclaimer “nuusparodie waarvan jy hou,” which is “news parody you like,” in the Afrikaans language. We have previously examined several articles labeled as satire, which emerged from the same website. The Ihlayanews Facebook page carries the following disclaimer, clearly labeling Ihlayanews.com “a news parody and satire website”:\n“Posts on this page and ihlayanews.com website may contain traces of truth. We do all we can to make sure the articles are complete fiction. All articles in our website are meant for mature audience with a dark sense of humour. If you feel offended in any way by our articles and you want to fight, please send us a place and time. Ihlayanews.com is a news parody and satire website.”\n\nThe Rwamirama hoax was picked up by the Nigerian websites Newsbreak and Talk of NAIJA, and from there, spread among more mainstream websites in the U.K., Europe, India and New Zealand. Many of the reports mentioned in this fact check, including the original Ihlayanews piece, used the same image, giving readers the clear impression that it showed Rwamirama:\n\nIn reality, that photograph was taken by the photographer Olivia Acland in the Democratic Republic of Congo and published by Reuters news agency in July 2019. The photograph’s original caption read: “A health worker checks the temperature of a man as part of the ebola screening upon entering the General Hospital in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, July 15, 2019.”\n\nWhile all of the news organizations and websites mentioned above were taken in by what turned out to be a hoax, The Sun engaged in the greatest measure of embellishment in their retelling of the false story.\nFirst, the tabloid greatly expanded the purported range of Rwamirama’s flatulence, taking the (non-existent) “six-meter radius” from the original (fake) Ihlayanews article, and increasing it more than a thousandfold, to a “six mile radius,” which authors Nick Parker and Chris Maximim breathlessly compared to the impact range of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb.\nSecond, despite the fact that the story was a hoax, the Sun managed to obtain additional comments on Rwamirama’s purportedly powerful flatulence, attributing two separate direct quotations to a “local barber” identified as “James Yoweri” and an unnamed “local chief.” Either Parker and Maximim were taken in three times over by including what they thought were quotes from two additional authentic sources, or they made those sources up.\nAfter Newshub reported that the story was a hoax, the New Zealand Herald deleted their original article. However, as of Dec. 12, every other report cited in this fact check was still available online.",

        "evidence": "In early May 2020, as the reported number of people infected by the COVID-19 coronavirus disease worldwide exceeded 1.2 million, people suspicious of the news media and politicians’ portrayal of the pandemic began widely sharing social media posts that claimed Tanzania President John Magufuli sent non-human samples to a COVID-19 testing lab and they came back positive.\nAiming to sound the alarm on allegedly faulty testing practices, several of the posts included a photograph of Magufuli, smiling in a crowd of people, with text including: “[He] has outsmarted somebody. He allowed coronavirus testing kits to be imported into his country. […] The tests were given human names and ages as they were sent off for results. They tested positive.”\n\nNumerous people contacted Snopes to investigate the posts, including one person who identified as a resident of Tanzania, where the government has reported less than 500 COVID-19 patients and 16 deaths as a result of the virus. “This has created a lot of confusion among family and friends,” the reader said. “I’m afraid that people might actually refuse testing/avoid to be tested out of fear of getting infected,” referring to the claim’s suggestion that COVID-19 testing kits could be contaminated and that’s why the non-human samples tested positive.\nFor our research, we first looked at where the claim about Magufuli originated. In televised remarks on May 3, the president said he was placing an order for an herbal tonic drink developed in Madagascar and touted as a cure for COVID-19 — despite the fact that there were no proven scientific remedies for the disease at the time of this writing. Rather, scientists and public health officials said the best way to stay healthy during the pandemic was to avoid exposure to the virus.\nOn May 4, 2020, BBC News published a story titled, “Coronavirus: Tanzanian president promises to import Madagascar’s ‘cure.'” Responding to the speech and news coverage, scientists and health officials — including those with the World Health Organization (WHO) — in the following days issued advisories against self-medicating with purported remedies for COVID-19. Among their concerns, scientists said the drink could drive resistance to malaria drugs. In an April 20 statement, which the scientific journal Science translated into English for Snopes’ interpretation, the National Academy of Medicine of Madagascar said, “It is a drug whose scientific evidence has not yet been established, and which risks damaging the health of the population, in particular that of children.”\nHere’s how that is related to the claim in the above-displayed meme: Within the same televised statement, the president questioned the credibility of the national laboratory where lab technicians processed COVID-19 tests, essentially alleging that they were mishandling samples and the number of positive tests were exaggerated as a result. In a BBC News story about Magufuli’s endorsement of the herbal drink, the news outlet translated the president’s comments to English, stating:\nHe said he had secretly had some animals and fruits tested at the laboratory and that a papaya (paw-paw), a quail and a goat returned positive samples.\n“That means there is possibility for technical errors or these imported reagents have issues,” he said, without giving more detail.\nThe following day, the Qatar-based Al Jazeera news network published a new story with the headline, “Tanzania COVID-19 lab head suspended as president questions data,” including the president’s claim regarding the fruit and animals.\nBut to better understand the potential motivation behind the Tanzanian president’s assertions alleging nefarious testing, one must keep in mind the tension between the country’s two main political groups — Magufuli’s party in power and the opposition — as well as criticism of the president’s handling of the pandemic unrelated to the claim.\nAt least one leader within the opposition party stood up for the national health laboratory despite Magufuli’s assertions, describing the leader’s suspension as “politics” interfering with his work, as outlined in the Al Jazeera piece. Additionally, the head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, defended the national health laboratory’s practices. He told reporters, according to Reuters, “The tests that Tanzania is using, we know they are working very well.”\nAlso, advocates for social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have criticized Magufuli’s decision not to put the country on a lock down and his public statements encouraging people to gather in places of worship.\nIn sum, given the full context for why the Tanzanian president shared what he believed to be an example of faulty COVID-19 testing — a fruit, quail, and goat allegedly tested positive for the novel virus under the guise of being human specimens — and given the lack of any evidence apart from his own statements to support it, we rate this claim “Unproven,” with the significant caveat that Magufuli has gone against public health officials’ advice for helping his residents overcome COVID-19 and the politically-charged climate surrounding the country’s response.",

        "evidence": "In November 2019, the website MyColumbusPower published an article claiming that a “new STD superbug” had the capacity to kill people within days and that health officials were worried that the incoming epidemic would be worse than AIDS:\nSTD Superbug May Be Deadlier Than AIDS; Kills Within Days\nThere is a new STD superbug that experts say may be more deadly than AIDS and could cause an epidemic.\nAccording to a report, an antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhea is more aggressive than AIDS, which means the potential to infect the public will be exponentially greater.\nThis article stirred up a considerable amount of concern on social media. However, this article was already several years old. Furthermore, the claim that there is an “STD superbug” that is “worse than AIDs” can be traced back to a single quote from a single doctor and has been disputed by other medical professionals.\nArchived pages from the Internet Wayback Machine show that while the date on this MyColumbusPower article currently reads Nov. 7, 2019, this article has actually been on the site since at least September 2014. Furthermore, the information contained within is based on a CNBC report that was originally published in April 2013.\nCNBC quoted Alan Christianson, a doctor of naturopathic medicine, who was concerned about an antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhea called “HO41” that had been discovered in a woman in Japan. \nThe news outlet reported:\nAn antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhea—now considered a superbug—has some analysts saying that the bacteria’s effects could match those of AIDS.\n“This might be a lot worse than AIDS in the short run because the bacteria is more aggressive and will affect more people quickly,” said Alan Christianson, a doctor of naturopathic medicine.\nEven though nearly 30 million people have died from AIDS related causes worldwide, Christianson believes the effect of the gonorrhea bacteria is more direct.\n“Getting gonorrhea from this strain might put someone into septic shock and death in a matter of days,” Christianson said. “This is very dangerous.”\n“It’s an emergency situation,” said William Smith, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. “As time moves on, it’s getting more hazardous.”\nWhile the above-quoted text did originate with a genuine news source, there are a few problems worth noting about this report. \nFor one, as of this writing, six years after the CNBC article was originally published, there has not been an AIDS-level epidemic due to this gonorrhea strain. While health officials may have been concerned at the time, the claim that this strain was “worse than AIDS” has proved to be overstated. \nThe CNBC article was also updated to note that “there have been no treatment failures reported in the U.S.for gonorrhea treated with currently-recommended first-line regimens.”\nFurthermore, although CNBC quoted a doctor of naturopathic medicine saying that this strain of gonorrhea could be “worse than AIDS,” other medical professionals weighed in at the time to dispute this classification. Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., told Live Science that this was not a fair comparison:\nA recent CNBC article with the headline “Sex Superbug Could Be ‘Worse Than AIDS'” quoted Alan Christianson, a naturopathic doctor, as saying that an antibiotic-resistant strain of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea “might be a lot worse than AIDS in the short run because the bacteria is more aggressive and will affect more people quickly.”\nHowever, some experts called the comparison hyperbolic.\n“I disagree with the general comparison,” said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.\n“The rate of complications from gonorrhea in terms of systemic problems is so much lower than the rate of complications from untreated AIDS infection,” Hirsch said.\nAlthough this strain of gonorrhea has not proven to be “worse than AIDS” and has not spurred any sort of epidemic, antibiotic-resistant strains of gonorrhea are a real and serious problem. Health officials have developed several ways to treat gonorrhea, but this disease has adapted over the years and is now resistant to many of them. \nThe CDC told us in an email that gonorrhea has developed resistance to most treatments over the years. As of this writing, however, the disease can still be treated with antibiotics:\nIs the CDC worried about a new STD superbug epidemic?\nOver time, gonorrhea has developed resistance to all but one class of antibiotics. Half of all infections are resistant or demonstrate signs of emerging resistance to at least one antibiotic. Unfortunately tests for antibiotic resistance are not currently available to healthcare providers at the time of treatment. History shows us that it is only a matter of time before resistance outsmarts our last treatment – ceftriaxone. Based on laboratory and surveillance data, ceftriaxone remains an effective treatment in the U.S. There has not been a confirmed treatment failure in the U.S. using the recommended regimen. However, we are concerned as treatment failures have been identified outside the U.S., including in Canada. CDC estimates that over 1 million cases of gonorrhea occur each year. Reducing the overall number of gonorrhea cases might prevent or delay the development of resistance to ceftriaxone, and is a critical component.\n·Can gonorrhea still be treated with antibiotics?\nYes, gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics. CDC recommends using a regimen of dual therapy for the treatment of gonorrhea – the injectable ceftriaxone, plus oral azithromycin.\nThis video from the CDC explains how health officials are racing to find new drugs to treat gonorrhea as this disease becomes more resistant to antibiotics:\n\nLastly, it should be noted that when this MyColumbusPower article was shared on social media it was accompanied by a misleading image:\nThis is not an image of gonorrhea or an STD superbug. This image actually shows the back of a man with AIDS and syphilis. ",

        "evidence": "A Facebook post shared in July 2019 claimed that the over-the-counter allergy drug Benadryl could be used to treat a rattlesnake bite. Since its original posting, the status has received more than 12,000 shares:\nBenadryl might save a life: For anyone in Rattlesnake country: I have learned something new that I thought was important enough that I wanted to pass on. A man was bitten by a rattlesnake a few days ago. He was getting ready to bale and turned over a windrow to check the moisture and the snake was in it.\nIt wrapped around his arm and bit him on the underside of the wrist. Luckily it was not a severe bite, the fang marks were clear, but not deep enough to draw blood.\nHe came straight to the house and we got ice on it and had him to the hospital within an hour.\nI called ahead so the emergency room was ready for him.\nBy the time he got there his arm was starting to swell to the shoulder and his throat was getting tight.\nThe first thing the emergency room did was give him Benadryl.\nApparently antivenom must be received within 4 hours of the snakebite, but the immediate threat is swelling and death of tissue, which was treated with the Benadryl.\nBut there is no truth to this claim, according to an international group of doctors, paramedics, and scientists collectively known as the Snakebite Foundation.\n“Benadryl is not effective for snake envenomations in humans or other animals. Please stop sharing this information. Antivenom along with proper supportive care are the only effective treatments supported by peer-reviewed literature,” wrote Snakebite Foundation member Dr. Nick Brandehoff, an emergency physician and medical toxicologist at the University of California, San Francisco at Fresno, in a blog post.\nRattlesnake venom is made up of a variety of peptides and proteins described in the scientific journal Chemical Ecology as a “multifunctional cocktail” that, once injected into the bloodstream, can cause harmful neurotoxic and inflammatory issues. In particular, rattlesnake venom contains two neurotoxins that can lead to pain, paralysis, tissue necrosis, and in extreme cases death.\nTo treat bites from pit vipers and other venomous snakes, the World Health Organization strictly advises the use of antivenoms, which work by boosting a patient’s immune response. Antivenoms are produced by harvesting snake venom and then using it to immunize donor animals such as horses and sheep. Antibodies from these animals are then harvested and purified from plasma that can “literally make a difference between life and death.”\nAn allergy, on the other hand, is an immune response to allergens that releases chemicals known as histamines. These are treated with antihistamines like Benadryl, more commonly known as diphenhydramine, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. In some cases, American Family Physician notes that antihistamines may be used to treat anaphylaxis, which the Journal of Wilderness Medicine reports has been known to result from a rattlesnake bite, in conjunction with epinephrine.\n“Comparing bee venom and snake venom to assume Benadryl will work is not congruent. Bee venom specially targets cells causing [the] release of histamine which results in swelling, pain, redness, and allergic reactions. This is similar to the pathway for non-venom induced allergic reactions,” wrote Brandehoff, highlighting that snake venom works “via different mechanisms.”\nIn the event of a rattlesnake bite, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends seeking medical attention as soon as possible. ",

        "evidence": "A few days before the release of “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” a movie starring Tom Hanks about children’s television host Fred Rogers, a representative for Ancestry.com told CBS News that the two men were related:\nTom Hanks bears a shocking resemblance to children’s television star Fred Rogers, who he plays in the upcoming film “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.” But the similarities are more than just good casting — the performers are actually related, according to a discovery made by Ancestry.com.\nHanks is sixth cousins with Rogers, and they share the same great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Johannes Mefford, a company representative told CBS News. The company utilized its database of over 20 billion online historical records to form Hanks’ family tree, the representative said.\nWe have no reason to doubt Ancestry.com’s claim. However, some readers may not quite understand just how distant a distant cousin really is. \nThe genealogy website reported that Rogers and Hanks are sixth cousins who share a 5x great-grandfather (or a great-great-great-great-great-grandfather). Here’s how Ancestry.com described Hanks relationship to Rogers: \n\nFred Rogers and Tom Hanks are sixth cousins sharing the same 5x great-grandfather, Johannes Mefford, who immigrated from Germany to America in the 18th century. Johannes raised a family of patriots; three of his sons (including Tom Hanks’ and Fred Rogers’s ancestors) served in the Revolutionary War. Fred Rogers’s 4x great-grandfather, William Mefford, served in the navy and was captured by the British in 1782. He endured life on a prison ship in Barbados and Antigua until he was released ten months later. Tom Hanks’s 4x great-grandfather, Jacob Mefford, joined the War as a private and participated in a skirmish at Chesapeake Bay. So, Rogers and Hanks not only share the same ancestor, they also descend from two brothers who fought for America’s independence.\nWhile it may be “true” to say that Hanks and Rogers are related, phrasing their relationship this way is a bit misleading. \nWe found varying estimates about just how closely related sixth cousins really are, but the general conclusion was that these “relatives” were very distant. For instance, a study by Ancestry DNA in 2014, based on British birth rates and census data, found that the average person in Britain had about 175,000 sixth cousins. \nWhile it’s true that Hanks and Rogers are related, they are distant cousins who probably don’t share much in terms of DNA. But don’t let that take away from Hanks’ performance as Rogers in “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood”:\n\nWe reached out to the Association of Professional Genealogists and the International Society of Genetic Genealogy. We will update this article when more information becomes available.",

These reports were often accompanied by the evidence-free suggestion that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 had “escaped” from this lab and the insinuation that, since this lab reportedly received funding from the Obama administration, the pandemic was therefore Obama’s fault.\nThis claim received widespread attention on April 17 when a reporter from the conservative outlet Newsmax asked President Donald Trump about it during a White House press briefing.\n.@realDonaldTrump responds to @EmeraldRobinson's query about a $3.7 million grant the U.S. gave to a Wuhan lab tied to COVID-19's origins.\n\\\"We will end that grant very quickly… It was made a number of years ago [2015]. Who was president then, I wonder?\\\" https://t.co/VlT7z8drtO pic.twitter.com/k9pi1D3nNF\n— Newsmax (@newsmax) April 18, 2020\n\nNewsmax reporter Emerald Robinson asked: “Thank you, Mr. President. U.S. Intelligence is saying this week that the coronavirus likely came from a level 4 lab in Wuhan. There’s also another report that the NIH under the Obama administration in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?”\nTrump responded: “The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million. I’ve been hearing about that. And we’ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area we’re looking at it, literally about an hour ago, also early in the morning, we will end that grant very quickly. But it was granted quite awhile ago. They were granted a substantial amount of money.”\nThere’s a lot to unpack there, so let’s start with the basic claim:\nDid the Obama administration grant $3.7 million to the Wuhan Institute of Virology?\nBetween 2014 and 2019, the EcoHealth Alliance was awarded a series of grants totaling approximately $3.7 million by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (a division of the National Institutes of Health) to study the “risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China.” Only a portion of this money has been used to fund research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, however, and approximately $700,000 of this grant money was awarded under the Trump administration.\nDespite having a grain of truth at its core, the claim that the Obama administration gave a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology is therefore misleading at best. It first gained prominence on April 11, 2020, on the heels of an article published in the Daily Mail. The British tabloid claimed that it had obtained documents showing that coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been funded by a $3.7 million grant from the U.S. government:\n“Documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday show the Wuhan Institute of Virology undertook coronavirus experiments on mammals captured more than 1,000 miles away in Yunnan – funded by a $3.7 million grant from the US government.”\nThe Daily Mail did not provide links or screenshots to these documents. They did, however, write that this money funded a research paper published in November 2017 entitled: “Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus.”\nThis is the title of a genuine paper published by researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It’s also true that this paper was partially funded by money granted by the National Institutes of Health. However, when we followed up using the grant number listed in the funding section of the paper (NIAID R01AI110964), we found that the NIH did not directly issue this series of grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services’ Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System (TAGGS) shows that NIAID R01AI110964 was awarded to the EcoHealth Alliance for “understanding the risk of bat coronavirus emergence.” Between 2014 and 2019, this global environmental health nonprofit organization received a total of $3.7 million from NIH:\n\nWhile a portion of these grants funded research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, this lab did not receive all $3.7 million. Under award number NIAID R01AI110964, NIH also funded studies produced by institutions in the United States, Australia, and Singapore, and the work involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology was an international collaboration with the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance.\nFurthermore, while these funds were originally appropriated by the NIH in 2014 during the Obama administration, the most recent payment, in 2019, was authorized by the Trump administration. The payments record in the above-displayed image from the Department of Health and Human Services show that the EcoHealth Alliance filed “Noncompeting Continuation” applications in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. In 2019, however, the organization filed a renewal application (previously called a “competing continuation”). This renewal application was awarded by the NIH under Trump’s administration.\nHere’s how NIH defines these two different types of grant applications:\nRenewal: Initial request for additional funding for a period subsequent to that provided by a current award. Renewal applications compete for funding with all other peer reviewed applications and must be developed as fully as though the applicant is applying for the first time. (Previously referred to as “competing continuation.”)\nNoncompeting Continuation: Request or award for a subsequent budget period within a previously approved project for which a recipient does not have to compete with other applications.\nAlthough the initial grant was approved under the Obama administration in 2014, EcoHealth Alliance’s renewal application was approved by the Trump administration in 2019. \nIt should also be noted that these grants were not awarded to fund a laboratory. They were awarded to fund research into how bat coronavirus could emerge and spread to human populations. The purpose of this kind of research, spurred into action by the 2002 SARS outbreak, is to understand the process of how coronaviruses become transmissible to humans. That earlier outbreak was also caused by a coronavirus linked to bats.\nIs it unusual for the United States to fund research in other countries? \nIn short, no. While this claim is often circulated as if the Obama administration did something unusual, or even nefarious, by awarding a series of grants that would subsequently fund research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the United States routinely provides funding to international research organizations. In fact, records show that the NIH has provided approximately $2.5 million in additional funding to various organizations in China (including Wuhan University) in 2018 and 2019, under the Trump administration. In 2007, while George W. Bush was president, NIH provided more than $2 million to various research centers across China. \nFurthermore, international organizations often come together to solve problems that could impact the global population, such as pandemic. In 2003, for instance, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on countries around the world to develop a diagnostic test for SARS. \nOn 17 March 2003, WHO called upon 11 laboratories in 9 countries to join a collaborative multi-center research project on SARS diagnosis. This network takes advantage of modern communication technologies (e-mail; secure web site) to share outcomes of investigation of clinical samples from SARS cases in real time. Daily assessment of research results supports immediate refinement of investigative strategies and permits instant validation of laboratory findings. Network members share on the secure WHO web site electron microscopic pictures of viruses, sequences of genetic material for virus identification and characterization, virus isolates, various samples from patients and post-mortem tissues. Samples from one and the same patient can be analysed in parallel in several laboratories and results shared in real time. This network joins the intellectual resources of leading laboratories worldwide for a common goal: the detection of the SARS agent and the development of a diagnostic test.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a similar call to action:\nWhile political leaders have locked their borders, scientists have been shattering theirs, creating a global collaboration unlike any in history. Never before, researchers say, have so many experts in so many countries focused simultaneously on a single topic and with such urgency. Nearly all other research has ground to a halt",

        "evidence": "On March 6, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump traveled to Tennessee to meet with local officials, residents, and first-responders as he surveyed the damage from a deadly tornado that killed at least 25 people statewide. The following day, a rumor holding that Trump had pulled out his personal checkbook during this visit to give money to tornado victims started to go viral on Facebook:\nThis Facebook post was shared close to 20,000 times within a few days of its initial posting. The text of the message was also copied and pasted by several additional social media accounts. The copypasta text reads:\nSo Trump comes to Nashville to oversee damage from the tornado. He flies into the area in a helicopter to get there without further traffic problems in the city. He writes PERSONAL checks to those in need, with his personal accountant in tow. No other President in history has done this. Then, he poses beside a Jeep. Now let’s hear all those Cherokee owners gawk!!!\nThere is no evidence to support these claims. We have not encountered any news articles about Trump writing personal checks to tornado victims, nor any videos or photographs capturing such a moment. \nFurthermore, this post claims that Trump had his “personal accountant in tow” during the visit. But that doesn’t appear to be the case. Trump was accompanied on his trip to Nashville with members of the state’s delegation, including Republican Senators Marsha Blackburn and Lamar Alexander, but we found no mentions of an “accountant” tagging along on this trip. Trump’s “personal accountant” likely refers to Allen Weisselberg, the Trump family’s longtime accountant and the current chief financial officer of The Trump Organization, but Weisselberg did not accompany Trump on this trip to Tennessee. \nThe Facebook post also gets details about Trump’s method of travel wrong. While Trump did take Marine One, the presidential helicopter, to get an aerial view of the damage and to travel to Cookeville, Tennessee, he actually traveled to Nashville via Air Force One.  \nA photograph supposedly showing Trump in Nashville after he “got his check book out and just started writing” was also spread on social media:\n\nThis photograph, however, does not show Trump during his visit to Nashville in March 2020. This image actually comes from Trump’s trip to Alabama in March 2019 after a tornado left 23 people dead. Contemporary news reports made no mention of Trump writing personal checks to to tornado victims during this trip, either. \nIt should be noted that Trump has donated his presidential salary to various causes since he took office. While the Trump administration has made public announcements concerning these donations, no such statement has been released about Trump allegedly writing personal checks to tornado victims in Nashville. In March 2020, it was announced that Trump would be donating to the Department of Health and Human Services To help “confront, contain, and combat coronavirus.” \nWe reached out to the White House and Kirby Pearce, the apparent author of the viral Facebook post, for comment. We will update this article if more information becomes available. \nThis rumor did not originate with a credible source, nor was it accompanied by any supporting evidence. Furthermore, this rumor appears to have a single source. While this text has been copied and pasted by several different accounts, nobody has provided any additional information. It appears that this rumor was simply made up out of whole cloth. ",

It is actually a near-verbatim copy of a letter written by New Hampshire state Rep. Fred Doucette to the editor of the Eagle Tribune in September 2019. The original letter was entitled “Don’t be brainwashed by what the Democrats tell you.”\nThe confusion over who penned this piece likely started in November 2019 after the Massachusetts Republican Party posted Doucette’s letter to its Facebook page alongside an image of Eastwood:\n\nIt should also be noted that the Massachusetts Republican Party’s Facebook post contained a second quote ostensibly uttered by Eastwood: “If Congress really gave a rat’s ass about the American people they would resign.” We took a brief look at this quote, too, and we were unable to trace it back to Eastwood. \nThis isn’t the first time Eastwood’s name has been invoked in an attempt to spread a pro-Trump message. Eastwood, who has supported conservative causes and candidates, also did not write an essay explaining why he “stick(s) my neck out for Trump.”",

        "evidence": "In April 2019, a video supposedly showing a chicken being hypnotized went viral on social media:\nThis is a genuine, unaltered video of a chicken reacting to a line being drawn in the sand directly in front of it. However, while this practice is often described as “hypnosis,” Dimitrios Beredimas, an agronomist and blogger at Strange Animals, noted that it would be more accurate to say that this chicken is in a state of “tonic immobility.”\nThis video appears to have originated on the Insane Monkey YouTube page. That version was accompanied by the following description:\nThis video shows you how it really works by drawing a single line in front of a chicken or a rooster and they become hypnotized almost instantly and will not move until the line is gone. This really works and i have done it many times and so have all my neighbors and family who have chickens and roosters.\nWhile many people may be seeing this chicken hypnotism video for the first time, this behavior has been acknowledged since at least 1648, when it was mentioned in “Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae” (“The Great Art of Light and Shadow”) by Athanasius Kircher, a German Jesuit scholar:\n\nSo what’s happening here? The video shows a chicken entering a catatonic-type state after experiencing a “fear-potentiated response” to a line drawn in the sand. This animal behavior is called “‘tonic immobility,” but readers may be more familiar with the colloquial terms “playing dead” or “playing possum.”  While this is typically a defensive mechanism, Beredimas notes that the chicken isn’t particularly good at pretending to be dead:\nThis strange animal behaviour is officially called ‘tonic immobility’, a natural state of semi-paralysis that many animals exhibit when under threat. Commonly known as apparent death, playing dead and playing possum, this state serves as a defensive mechanism as most predators prefer live prey.\nIn chickens, this is most probably a vestigial trait as it doesn’t seem to have a useful purpose. The chicken doesn’t make a good job hiding the fact it’s still alive. Its obvious that is breathing and we can see some eye movement and blinking.\nSince this phenomenon may be new to city folk, let’s take a look at a few other videos showcasing this technique:\nIf you have access to a chicken and want to try this, the Strange Animals blog provided the following instructions:\nThe trick is quite simple. All you have to do is hold the chicken’s head down against the ground, and draw a straight line using a stick, your finger, a piece of chalk or whatever.\nThe line should start at the beak and extend straight outwards, in front of the chicken. If done properly, the chicken — or rooster — will be put into a state of trance and lie still for anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes! To de-hypnotize the chicken, just clap your hands or give it a gentle push. It may take a few tries to awaken the bird.\nThis isn’t the only way to hypnotize a chicken. Other methods include swirling your finger in a circle around the birds head or tucking its head underneath its wing. The latter method was briefly mentioned in Ernest Hemingway’s posthumous 1985 book, “The Dangerous Summer“:\nYou can lay the chicken down with its head still under its wing and it will lie, hypnotized, for an hour or more or until you wake it. It was a parlor trick that had much success in East Africa. Sometimes I would have a dozen chickens lying asleep in a row on the porch of some native hut in a village under Kilimanjaro when we needed something badly and it was necessary to make magic to obtain it.\nWhile Hemingway may be taking some artistic license with his “an hour or more” sentence, and although this trick isn’t guaranteed to work on all breeds of chicken, the above-displayed viral video showcases a technique to “hypnotize” chickens that has been used for centuries. ",

        "evidence": "The one thing an already gaffe-prone politician running for high office most wants to avoid is saying something impolitic about race. But that’s exactly what happened to former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on the presidential campaign trail, according to one quote meme:\n\nIn this case the meme is accurate. While speaking at a town hall event in Des Moines, Iowa, hosted by the Asian & Latino Coalition on Aug. 8, 2019, Biden let slip with a statement that “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids,” thereby implying that economically disadvantaged persons are all non-white.\nThe unfortunate remark by Biden was reported on by The New York Times and captured on video:\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. raised eyebrows during a speech in Iowa when he said that “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids,” an apparent gaffe for a Democratic presidential candidate whose record on race has come under intense scrutiny during the primary.\nMr. Biden was speaking on education and the need to challenge students at a town hall hosted by the Asian & Latino Coalition in Des Moines when he made the remark, and then quickly sought to recover from it.\n“We should challenge students in these schools,” Mr. Biden said. “We have this notion that somehow if you’re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.”\nHe paused, then added: “Wealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids — no I really mean it, but think how we think about it.”\nKate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, later issued a statement asserting that the candidate “misspoke”:\n“Vice President Biden misspoke and immediately corrected himself during a refrain he often uses to make the point that all children deserve a fair shot, and children born into lower-income circumstances are just as smart as those born to wealthy parents,” Ms. Bedingfield said. “Joe Biden has spent his life fighting for civil rights and the dignity of all people.”",

        "evidence": "In mid-February 2019, an image supposedly showing an enormous snake being held up by a crane started to circulate on social media. Attached to photograph was the claim that the super-sized serpent had been found by a plumber who was investigating a clog:Ric Bauer told us via Facebook that he didn’t have any first-hand knowledge of the incident behind the picture and that he was merely re-sharing an image he had encountered on another Facebook page, “Key West in Your Face.” The Key West page made no mention of a plumber or a clog, however, and Bauer told us that he had reposted the image with his own caption: “Florida Plumber Finds Clog.”In other words, the “plumber” portion of this claim did not originate with a news report or first-hand knowledge, but apparently as a joke.We have not been able to track down the exact origins of this photograph, but we have found a number of people who shared this same picture as if the snake had been found in a variety of locations. An 11 February 2019 post on the web forum , for example, reported that this snake was found in Mississippi: “A place in Enterprise, Mississippi where a friend works was having serious “clogging” problems with the “outflow” of their plumbing. This morning they found this.”Other Facebook users stated that the snake was found in various Florida cities, including Plant City and Immokalee. Gabrielle Dawkins, a reporter with WBBH in Fort Myers, posted a statement she had received from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission declaring that they had not received any reports about this snake:The earliest iteration of this image that we could find involved yet another location. On 9 February 2019, Facebook user Sherri Blair posted this image and claimed that the snake was found in New Orleans East:The fact that this single photograph has been attached to a multiple locations indicates that those sharing this image do not know its true origins. Furthermore, the earliest posting of this image that we encountered (February 9th) was accompanied by the simple caption “New Orleans East.” It wasn’t until two days later that the “Florida plumber finds a clog” caption was superfluously attached to the photograph.It should be noted, however, that this photograph (wherever it was taken) appears to be genuine. Although Florida’s FWC believes that this image might be Photoshopped, we’d argue that the picture is actually another example of forced perspective photography. While it appears that the man in blue is touching the snake, the animal is likely much closer to the camera than the man is, making the reptile appear much larger than its true size.

        "evidence": "In June 2020, a specious rumor started circulating on social media about how Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Joe Biden’s great-grandfather was a slave owner who fought in the Confederate Army. There was no truth to this claim. This rumor was circulated in the form of a meme that included a photograph of a Confederate soldier named Richard Young Bennett (no relation to Biden), misidentified the former vice president’s great grandfather as “Joseph J. Biden” (Biden’s actual paternal great grandfather was George T. Biden), and baselessly claimed that this fictional person was a Confederate soldier and slave owner.\nWhile that rumor was, and still is, false, it did cause some social media users to dig through Biden’s family history to see if there were any familial links to slavery. In August 2020, we received a tip that Biden’s great-great-great grandfather, a man by the name of Thomas Herbert Randle, was a slave owner. \nThe claim that Biden’s great-great-great grandfather owned a slave is based on genealogy records from websites such as Ancestry.com and a slave schedule — a form used in the years 1850 and 1860 to enumerate the number of African American slaves on the U.S. Census.\nWe do not doubt that Biden had a great-great-great grandfather named Thomas Herbert Randle, and we see no reason to be suspicious of the 1850 slave schedule listing a Thomas H. Randle who recorded owning a 14-year-old Black slave. However, the question remains if these two listings refer to the same individual. \nHere’s what we’ve been able to gather so far.\nWho Was Biden’s Great-Great-Great Grandfather? \nAccording to genealogy sites such as Wikitree, Geni.com, geneanet.org, and wargs.com, a website that traces the ancestry of United States presidents and political figures, Biden had a great-great-great grandfather named Thomas Herbert Randle.  \nRandle was born in Baltimore County, Maryland, circa 1803, and would go on to marry a woman named Mary Ann Shoemaker. Randle, a farmer, had two children (at least), named William Thomas and Lydia Ann, the latter of whom married Joseph H. Biden.\nLydia and Joseph H. Biden had a child named George, who had a child named Joseph, who had a child named Joseph, who had a child that would become the vice president of the United States. In other words, Thomas Herbert Randle is former VP  Biden’s father’s (Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr.) father’s (Joseph H. Biden) father’s (George T. Biden) father’s (Joseph H. Biden) wife’s (Lydia Ann Biden) father (Thomas Herbert Randle), making him Biden’s great-great-great grandfather. \nWho Was Slave Owner Thomas H. Randle? \nAccording to the Maryland State Archives’ “Legacy of Slavery” database, a “Thomas H. Randle” from Baltimore County reported owning a 14-year-old Black male slave in the 1850 federal census:\nWe accessed this record via Ancestry.com, and can confirm that a Thomas H. Randle is truly listed on this 1850 slave schedule. Randle is not listed as a slave owner in 1860.\nThis document also provides no additional information about Randle other than his name, and no information about the 14-year-old slave other than their age and gender. The only additional information we could glean comes from the title of this document, which reads: “Schedule 2 – Recorded slave inhabitants in 1st district in the county of Baltimore state of Maryland, enumerated by me, on the 16th day of August 1850.” The document was signed by a “Samuel Storm.”\nIs Biden’s Great-Great-Great Grandfather the Same Thomas Randle Listed on This 1850 Slave Schedule?\nThere’s a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests that these two Randles are indeed one and the same. For instance, both men share the same first and last name, as well as the middle initial. Census information for Biden’s great-great-great grandfather also lists him as a farmer, an occupation that was known to use slavery for tasks such as tending crops, doing household chores, and gardening. \nIn the 1850 census, a Thos. H. Randle is listed as living in Baltimore’s 1st district. This is the same year and district listed in the aforementioned slave schedule. The Thos. listed here appears to be Biden’ great great great grandfather. In addition to having the same name (Thos. is an abbreviation for Thomas), this person was also born circa 1803 and is listed alongside a “Mary A” (presumably Randle’s wife) and a “Lydia” (presumably Randle’s daughter).\nIn other words, Biden’s great-great-great grandfather was named Thomas H. Randle, and in 1850, he lived in Baltimore’s 1st district. This is the same name and the same district listed in the 1850 slave schedule of a man who owned a 14-year-old Black slave. \nHere are the relevant documents: 1850 Slave Schedule / 1850 U.S. Census. \nWhile this evidence may seem convincing, we can’t say with certainty that these two Randles were indeed one and the same.\nFor starters, we simply don’t have any information about the Randle listed on the 1850 slave schedule (such as his age or family members) that would help us definitively connect him to Biden’s great-great-great grandfather. We also found a few examples of other Thomas Randles (or Randols, or Randalls, or Randells — misspelled names were common on the census) living in Maryland around this period. While these Randles were not listed for Baltimore County’s 1st district in 1850, the fact that there were other Randle families living in this area opens up the possibility that the Randle on the slave schedule was a different person than Biden’s great-great-great grandfather. \nIt’s also possible that some of the census information contained errors, or that the census records we examined were not complete. For instance, a 1958 news article from The Baltimore Sun mentioned a “Justice Thomas H. Randle,” but we have been unable to connect this Randle to any census records.  \nWhat About the 1860 Slave Schedule?\nThe U.S. Census enumerated African American slaves on “slave schedules” in both 1850 and 1860. While the 1850 slave schedule listed a “Thomas H. Randle,” this name is not found in 1860. We did find a record for a “Thomas Randal” and, as we noted earlier, spelling mistakes were common in the U.S. Census so it’s possible that these two listings refer to the same individual.\nHowever, the location of these listings changes between 1850 and 1860. In 1850, the slave schedule noted that a “Thomas H. Randle” owned a 14-year-old Black slave in the 1st district of Baltimore County. This is the same district that Thomas Herbert Randle, Biden’s great-great-great grandfather, lived in according to the 1850 U.S. Census. In 1860, however, the slave schedule notes that “Thomas Randall” owned a 5-year-old Black female slave in the 8th district of Anne Arundel County. According to the U.S. Census, Biden’s great-great-great grandfather was not living in this location in 1860. On the census, Thomas Herbert Randle’s location is listed as the 13th district of Baltimore County.\nDid Biden’s Great-Great-Great Grandfather Have Servants?\nWhile we can’t definitively say that Biden’s great-great-great grandfather owned a slave in 1850, we can say with relative certainty that this person had servants. U.S. Census records from 1860 show that Thomas H. Randle had two “servants” named Peggy and Delia Malters, both Black women in their 40s. A 19-year-old Black “farm laborer” named Richard Savoy was also listed under Randle’s name. It should be noted that this document lists “free inhabitants” in the 13th district in Baltimore County, Maryland:\nWe don’t know the specific conditions about the relationships that these individuals had with Randle. While the people listed on this document were identified as “free inhabitants,” and while they may not have legally been considered slaves, people considered servants in the 1860s did not have the same freedoms as regular laborers.\nPBS described the difference between an indentured servant and a slave as follows:\nServants typically worked four to seven years in exchange for passage, room, board, lodging and freedom dues. While the life of an indentured servant was harsh and restrictive, it wasn’t slavery. There were laws that protected some of their rights. But their life was not an easy one, and the punishments meted out to people who wronged were harsher than those for non-servants. An indentured servant’s contract could be extended as punishment for breaking a law, such as running away, or in the case of female servants, becoming pregnant.\nRandle’s daughter Lydia is not listed in the above-displayed image from the 1860 Census because by this time she had already married Joseph Biden (who spelled his name Byden). Lydia can be seen listed here alongside Joseph in the 1860 census. \nTo Sum Things Up: \n2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s great-great-great grandfather Thomas Herbert Randle was a farmer who was born circa 1803 in Maryland. Randle, whose daughter Lydia would marry Biden’s great-great grandfather, Joseph H. Biden, lived in Baltimore County’s 1st District in 1850, according to U.S. Census Records. A slave schedule from this same year and district lists a “Thomas H. Randle” as owning a 14-year-old Black slave.\nHowever, this slave schedule provides no additional information about the listed Randle (such as age or familial relations) that would allow us to definitively say that they are the same person, and we can’t rule out the possibility that the “Thomas H. Randle” listed on the 1850 slave schedule is a different person than the “Thos. H. Randle” listed on the 1850 U.S. Census. \nIt should also be noted that there wasn’t a Thomas H. Randle listed on the slave schedule in 1860. There was a “Thomas Randal,” but the location listed on this slave schedule does not match the location listed for Biden’s great-great-great grandfather in the U.S. Census in 1860. This may indicate that the slave-owning Randle was indeed a different person than Biden’s great-great-great grandfather. Or, it could be entirely unrelated to the 1850 listing. \nWhile we can’t say for sure if Biden’s great-great-great grandfather owned a slave in 1850, he did list having two Black servants and a Black farm laborer on the 1860 U.S. Census.  According to the census, however, these three individuals were considered “free inhabitants.”\nWe’ve reached out to Biden’s campaign for comment, but have yet to hear a response. We also reached out to Maryland state archivists, and we will update this article if more information becomes available. ",

        "evidence": "On 10 March 2019,   reported that the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) was considering leveraging people’s social media accounts to determine the veracity of their disability claims:The story resulted in spin-offs from various publications including  (“How a Trump Proposal Could Reduce ‘Happy’ Disabled People”) and the Daily Kos website (“Trump administration seeks to monitor social media of disability recipients, including vets”). As with any story that sounds far-fetched, Snopes.com readers queried whether the story could be believed.It is true that SSA proposed using social media posts in making disability determinations. The proposal was put forward in its fiscal year 2020 budget request, noting (on page 26) that the agency wants to take a more proactive approach in looking at people’s posts on the platforms. Whereas social media posts can currently come into play in fraud investigations, the practice could be expanded, per the budget request:(CDI refers to the Cooperative Disability Investigations unit and is responsible for working in conjunction with various agencies to “investigate suspicious disability claims under SSA’s Title II and Title XVI disability Programs.”)In a statement emailed to Snopes, agency spokesman Darren Lutz said SSA is studying strategies of “other agencies and private entities to determine how social media might be used to evaluate disability applications” but declined to provide further details.Although neither   nor  articles mentioned veterans, the Daily Kos website cited a tweet posted by writer Dylan Park that introduced the idea that veterans could also be targets of such investigations.\nIn that same post, Park recounts having benefits cut for telling a medical professional he was feeling “fine” in one visit, despite having post-traumatic stress disorder from his experiences on the battlefield.\nThe SSA and Veterans Administration (VA) run separate benefits programs for adjudicating and dispersing disability benefits. But the two programs can overlap, meaning a disabled veteran can receive benefits from both agencies simultaneously. We sent questions to SSA asking how investigating social media posts could impact veterans receiving SSA disability payments but got no answer by the time of publication.The SSA hasn’t yet offered specifics on how it might use social media in evaluating disability claims. But writing for , Imani Barbarin, who has cerebral palsy and is an advocate for the disabled community, observed that the policy could backfire by mistakenly rejecting people from the program. She noted that such a proposal demonstrates a “fundamental misunderstanding” of disability and how a social media post made by a disabled person could easily be misconstrued.“Disabled people don’t all function in the same way, and disability is not a set of stereotypes like taking selfies staring longingly at the world. They live lives while managing their energy for the activities they can handle and trying to make those they cannot more accessible,” Barbarin wrote. “Additionally, studies have shown that a majority of social media users show only the good in their lives, not the hardships or difficulties.”Perusing people’s social media posts is already a common practice by private insurance companies determining coverage or investigating claims. But the prospect of the U.S. government adopting the practice to evaluate applications has raised a number of concerns among privacy advocates and advocates for the disabled community, as CBS News reported:Furthermore as CBS reports, “it’s hard to imagine how federal disability examiners could even authenticate profiles to evaluate applicants for disability. Social media profiles aren’t tied to Social Security numbers, for example, and many users set their profiles to private, preventing strangers from viewing them.”",

        "evidence": "In the summer of 2017, reports emerged that the administration of President Donald Trump had reversed existing plans to enhance protections for certain marine animals off the West Coast of the United States. On 12 June 2017, the  published an article with the headline “Trump cancels whale and sea turtle protections,” which was shared more than 62,000 times on Facebook and read:The decision has continued to cause concern among some observers throughout the ensuing 12 months, and enjoyed a resurgence of online attention in July 2018.The  article, unlike other more comprehensive (but less widely shared) reports from June 2017, contained a mix of accurate statements and incomplete or misleading characterizations of the decision made at that time.In 2015, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council recommended to the National Marine Fisheries Service (which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA) that they introduce “hard caps” on the number of marine mammals, including whales and sea turtles, that could be “taken” (i.e., caught up in fishing nets) in a particular type of fishing along the West Coast.The fishery in question involves around 20 vessels, mainly targets swordfish off the coast of California, and uses a method called “drift gillnet” (DGN) fishing, which involves wide mesh nets lowered under the surface of the water to passively catch the target fish as they move into the paths of the nets. Because of the passive nature of this fishing method (which literally involves casting a very wide net), other species are sometimes inadvertently caught up and killed and then thrown back into the sea. This process is known as “bycatch.”Under the 2015 proposal, if the bycatch met or exceeded a certain level, the entire fishery of 20 vessels would be shut down for at least the remainder of that fishing season.The fisheries service drafted a proposed new rule (RIN 0648-BG23) based on these recommendations, then oversaw a period of consultation and consideration of alternatives to the proposal, its potential impacts, and so on — a process known as a “regulatory impact review.” This process is standard practice in federal agencies across government departments when considering a possible change to regulations. Some proposals are ultimately adopted, and others are not. In the end, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council, which advises and guides regulatory actions and policy-making by the fisheries service, recommended implementing the hard caps. However, the fisheries service disagreed and in May 2017 decided not to implement the proposed rule.Michael Milstein, a spokesperson for the fisheries service, told us that it is “somewhat unusual” for the fisheries service to go against the recommendations of the Pacific Fisheries Management Council but explained the rationale behind the decision, which was ultimately overseen by Barry Thom, regional administrator for the NOAA Fisheries west coast region.According to Milstein, during the 1970s and 1980s, non-target species, including some animals designated as protected and even endangered, were being entangled in drift gillnets used for commercial swordfish and shark fishing — hundreds per year at one point. “Historically, there was a clear problem,” he told us.In response to this, the fisheries service set up task forces known as “take reduction teams,” composed of scientists and fishermen, whose function was to find ways to reduce the number of animals being entangled and killed in commercial fishing. Along the West Coast, the take reduction team came up with several ways to minimize and mitigate against the unintended bycatch resulting from drift gillnet fishing, including “pingers” and “net extenders.” According to Milstein, these innovations have dramatically reduced the number of non-target species being entangled in drift gillnets:Milstein also pointed to the protected areas that have been established off the west coast, in which drift gillnet fishing has been banned entirely, in order to protect sea turtles in particular. Milstein’s assertion is supported by scientific evidence. A NOAA technical memorandum published in January 2017 found that acoustic pingers, in particular, had driven major declines in the level of bycatch among several species of whales, dolphins, and turtles, since the mid-to-late 1990s. Among some species, in particular the beaked whale, bycatch has been close to eliminated. For this reason, Milstein told us, the fisheries service decided that the potential benefits of imposing a hard cap on bycatch numbers, which were already low and declining, were outweighed by the potential economic damage done to the fishery, if it were to be shut down:Some environmental activists have rejected this rationale. Catherine Kilduff, a lawyer for the Center for Biological Diversity, told the Associated Press in June 2017 that even relatively small numbers of deaths can have an outsized impact on communities of endangered species. “If they catch one, it’s a huge problem for the population,” she argued. Milstein said the potential economic damage caused to some fishermen by shutting down the entire fishery would be “hard for them to bear,” and suggested such an outcome would be especially unfair for those fishermen who were “doing everything right” and properly implementing existing take reduction measures.In their final ruling on the proposal in May 2017, the fisheries service wrote:In particular, the fisheries service indicated that the economic costs to a fisherman of a one or two-season closure could force them into alternative employment altogether, and if that were not available to them, these short-term costs could easily escalate into long-term economic damage if the hard caps were implemented. The ‘s headline — “Trump cancels whale and sea turtle protections” — was misleading. First, the decision was not taken by President Trump himself, but rather was overseen by NOAA Fisheries West Coast regional administrator Barry Thom, after an extensive period of consultation and a standard regulatory impact review. Thom was appointed to the post in October 2016, during the administration of President Barack Obama. Second, the headline could give rise to the impression that President Trump (or his administration) had terminated  protections for whales and sea turtles or had actively unraveled existing protections. This was not the case, as we have explained. Several protections, proven to be effective, remain in place.And finally, the article described the May 2017 decision as a “rule change,” but in fact it was the opposite. What had been proposed was a new rule, not a change, and the fisheries service’s decision simply meant that that new rule would not be implemented, keeping in place the status quo.",

But while Baio, Nugent, Sabato, and Diamond and Silk are all supporters of Trump, the Trump campaign has not officially announced this lineup of speakers at the convention. \nMike Sington, the Twitter user who originally posted this message, confirmed to The Associated Press that this tweet was intended to be a joke. \nThe Trump War Room, a Twitter account managed by the president’s campaign, labeled the message as “fake news”:\n\nThe schedule for the 2020 Republican National Convention has undergone some changes this year, in large part because of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

The three new cases add up to the over 400 cases confirmed in Italy under a week.\nPope Francis missed a planned Mass with clergy in Rome yesterday after showing Coronavirus-like symptoms. The Vatican had earlier said the pontiff, 83, had a slight indisposition and could proceed with the rest of his planned work today.\nThe pope and his aides have been quarantined and receiving medical attention near Santa Marta, the Vatican hotel where he lives. The pope was seen coughing and blowing his nose during the Asha [sic] Wednesday Mass.\nThe MCM article was shared widely on social media and formed the basis of a video by YouTube user Chadd Sinclair, who repeated the article’s claims.\nThose claims were false. As of late February, when MCM published its report, and March 3, when this fact check was published, the Vatican had not “confirmed” that Francis or any of his aides had tested positive for the coronavirus. Moreover, according to one unconfirmed news report in Italy, the pope had actually tested negative for the disease.\nAt an Ash Wednesday service in the Vatican on Feb. 26, Francis was seen coughing and blowing his nose, causing some observers to speculate that the 83-year-old may have been among hundreds affected by a widespread coronavirus outbreak in Italy:\nHowever, on the following day Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni clarified that Francis was suffering only from a “slight indisposition,” and on Feb. 28 Bruni explicitly rejected suggestions that Francis had contracted coronavirus, telling reporters, “There is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition.”\nOn March 1, the pope himself told followers at St. Peter’s Square that he had a cold (“il raffreddore”) and would not be attending a Lenten retreat in the nearby town of Arricia. \nNot only had the Vatican not “confirmed” suspicions that Francis had tested positive for the coronavirus, but the Holy See had also explicitly rejected such claims, saying that Francis was only suffering from a cold.

In flying that flag, Montgomery County Council officials had to temporarily remove another flag, a POW/MIA flag, as the flag pole was not equipped to simultaneously hold multiple flags.\nNBC Washington reported of the subject that:\nFor the first time ever, a rainbow pride flag flew outside a Maryland county’s executive office building, but the flag it replaced had people raising objections.\nMontgomery County Council member Evan Glass, the council’s first LGBTQ member, helped celebrate the raising of the pride flag Monday morning at Veterans Memorial Plaza in Rockville.\nBut Vietnam veteran John “Bill” Williams said he’s upset the flag that honored soldiers still missing was taken down …\n“I wasn’t happy about it at all because the park is supposed to be a veterans park,” Williams said. “People died. Now they took it down and put another flag up.”\nMontgomery County Councilman Evan Glass said at the time that once officials learned the flag pole couldn’t accommodate both flags, they quickly worked on a solution: “The flag post was only able to accommodate one flag, and when we learned of that, we are quickly, the county government, is quickly changing it. So we’re adding more ringlets so that by tomorrow morning both flags will be raised.”\nThe following day, the Montgomery County government rectified the situation by adding more ringlets to the flag pole so that the pride flag could be flown during Pride Month without replacing any of the other flags.\nThe county said in a statement on the issue that:\nThe Pride flag did not replace the POW/MIA flag. On June 10th, when the Pride flag was raised, there was not a mechanism in place for both flags to be displayed. This has been corrected, and both flags are flying now. The Pride flag was raised to honor Pride Month and will be replaced by the County flag at the end of June.\nMore than a week after this issue was rectified, the website The Blaze published an article headlined “Rainbow pride flag replaces POW/MIA flag at veterans memorial plaza — and public outcry is ignited.” But the piece didn’t disclose the POW/MIA flag was still being flown until its penultimate sentence.

        "evidence": "Protests against police brutality and racism spread across the U.S. after the police-custody death of a Black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis in May 2020. At one such protest on June 21, 2020, an encounter between police and an amputee demonstrator in Columbus, Ohio, made the news for its graphic — and conflicting — accounts of events.\nVideos, images, and social media accounts claimed that the police pepper-sprayed an amputee protester and removed his prosthetic legs. We received many reader queries, and looked into this by addressing events of that day in the order in which they may have occurred. While we learned that officers did pepper-spray the demonstrator, it is unclear if they or someone else removed his prosthetics, either intentionally or unintentionally.\nI guess this is acceptable @MayorGinther Pulling a double amputee by his legs who then had to crawl up the street?

Police footage showed him throwing water bottles at the police, and what looked like a plywood sign and/or shield at an officer, who was struck in the area of his head but was not seriously injured.\nAfter this, another officer attempted to arrest the man. According to both body camera footage and videos taken by protesters, the police used pepper spray liberally. The officer sprayed in the amputee’s direction as well as on protesters who were trying to stop the arrest.\nAt least one image on Twitter showed the man’s prosthetic leg as he fell while an officer pepper-sprayed him and others.  The above events start 1 minute and 49 seconds into this video released by the Columbus Police Department:\nPolice Sgt. James Fuqua can be heard explaining the events around the 4-minute mark in another video at a press conference, where he admitted that the arresting officer used pepper spray.\nThen things began to get murky. The police officer, in his initial attempt to arrest the man, tackled him to the ground, grabbed his T-shirt, and dragged him. Police footage showed individuals who appeared to be protesters pulling the man away from the police by grabbing his legs, while others formed a barricade to stop the police from pursuing them. Police footage ended there, and Fuqua maintains that the officer did not pursue them, but the man appeared to return to the melee around 15 minutes later, shirtless and with his hair pulled back.\nFuqua denied that the police removed the prosthetic legs, saying that the officers were likely not aware that he was an amputee. So far, no video has emerged showing their removal.\nBut protesters claimed a different version of events. Eyewitnesses said they saw police officers grab the man by the ankles, and when his prosthetics came loose, the officers tried to take them. An eyewitness told Snopes that he saw the amputee “get knocked down and maced,” and then lost sight of him. He did not see the moment the man’s prosthetics came off, but did spot him “running away on his hands and hips.” A couple seconds later he saw “two or three protesters break away from the [scuffle] with [the man’s] legs and follow him.”\nThis widely shared Reddit video of the protester lying on the ground with his prosthetic legs separated from his torso may have occurred after these events.\n CPD just hit and maced a double amputee. Bravo, you heroes. Unarmed, no legged, they dgaf from      Columbus \n \nIt is possible that the events these protesters described took place after the events shown in police footage, but we could not confirm that. We reached out to Columbus Police Department officials and asked them to shed light on what occurred after the officer first tackled and attempted to arrest the man. A representative told us that they “don’t have footage of [the amputee] from the time of the incident until 20 minutes later when he is seen walking back into the protests.”\nWe reached out to other protesters who were present at the rally and will update this article as more information becomes available. The man remains unidentified.\nIn sum, we know that the demonstrator in question was pepper-sprayed, but accounts conflict on whether police removed his prosthetic legs. Available footage is not sufficient to tell the entire story, therefore we rate this claim a “Mixture.”",

        "evidence": "Through the summer of 2020, the question of whether U.S. schools should reopen amidst the COVID-19 disease pandemic grew into a contentious political issue. School superintendents across the country were dismayed by President Donald Trump’s push to reopen schools despite the health risks of doing so, and after Education Secretary Betsy DeVos gave an interview with CNN in July 2020 during which she reiterated the administration’s goal, one statement attributed to her began making the internet rounds.\nSnopes readers asked us if DeVos actually said, “You can’t plan for something that hasn’t happened yet,” in response to a question about what would happen if a school had a COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe following image reproducing that alleged statement was widely shared on Facebook:\n\nThe statement appeared to be a highly paraphrased version of what DeVos said during her July 12 interview with CNN’s Dana Bash. We watched the 21-minute interview and found that Devos’ response at roughly the 17:44 mark appears to be what was referenced in the meme. In answering Bash’s questions, Devos often went in circles, hedged, or sidestepped providing direct responses. She did not use the exact words presented in the meme, and although she did say something similar, it was in a different context than that offered in the meme.\nDuring the interview, Bash persistently queried DeVos about what school districts should do in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak in the classroom, and a transcript of part of that exchange reads as follows:\nBash: I am asking you ma’am, as Secretary of Education, if there is a flare-up [of COVID-19], should schools revert to remote learning?\nDeVos: I think the go-to needs to be kids in school, in person, in the classroom, because we know for most kids that’s the best environment for them …\nBash: [interrupts] I understand that, but what if they can’t?\nDeVos: What if they can’t what?\nBash: What if the school district feels that they can’t safely go into the school because there is a flare-up in that district. Remote learning, are you okay with it in that situation?\nDeVos: If there is a short-term flare-up for a few days, that’s a different situation than planning for an entire school year in anticipation of something that hasn’t happened. That’s a very different thing, kids have gotta be back in school …\nAs indicated by the bolded section, DeVos did not directly say that schools couldn’t plan for a potential COVID-19 outbreak, but rather that planning for a long-term, school-year shutdown was “different” than preparing for handling a brief flare-up of COVID-19 that might occur after schools had re-opened. We should note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that if a school found at least one confirmed COVID-19 case in the building, it should assess the risk, and regardless of the extent of community spread, shut down for potentially 2-5 days to clean and contact trace. In the case of substantial community spread, the CDC has recommended “extended school dismissals.”\nLike many of DeVos’ responses, this one did not offer a firm answer about what a school district could or should do in that situation. Rather, her language repeatedly sidestepped Bash’s questioning in favor of returning to her main talking point about the necessity of reopening schools. \nIn summary, the meme circulating on Facebook suggested a clear statement on DeVos’ part that schools could not actually prepare for a COVID-19 outbreak that “hasn’t happened yet.” DeVos did not expressly say or suggest that, so we thus rate this claim “Mostly False.”",

The man that raped Jessica currently has visitation rights to her two children. The judge told Jessica for each visit she denied her rapist, she’d have to spend 48 hours in the county jail.”A day earlier, on 10 June, the London  published a report with the headline “Rape Survivor Fighting Rapist for Custody of Child in Alabama.” That report was actually a re-publication of a 9 June article by the , in which Stallings allowed her full name to be used. The  reported that:“…[Stallings] said she was 12 when her mother’s half brother began climbing into her bed at night. Before she turned 18,she had endured four pregnancies. The first ended in miscarriage, and one son died of a disease more likely to occur in cases of incest. Then her family forced her to marry her uncle, she said. Stallings later fled, and a court deemed the marriage illegal because of a ‘familial relationship.’“She built a stable home in Fort Payne, Ala., for her sons, now 15 and 12. Butin the winter of 2017, she discovered that she was not yet free of the man she calls ‘Uncle Lenny.’ Despite DNA tests that proved incest, he maintained parental rights to the boys andfought Stallings for visitation. A judge ruled he was entitled to see them for three days during Christmastime.“Her uncle — Lenion Richard Barnett Jr., 39 — could not be reached for comment, and his attorneys declined to speak about his case with Stallings. ‘It’s sickening,’ Stallings said. ‘I’ve spent my entire life scared to death of my rapist, and now, I’m fighting him for custody of my children.'”These accounts of Stallings’ plight prompted widespread reaction on social media, as well as multiple inquiries from Snopes readers about the full facts surrounding the case. The news articles that surrounded Stallings’ public statements in June 2019 contained a significant degree of accuracy. Stallings and Barnett were indeed engaged in a child-custody and visitation dispute, as of June 2019, and documentary evidence exists that demonstrates one of the children in question was born as a result of a statutory rape perpetrated against Stallings. However, in several instances those news reports failed to provide readers with important contextual information, or to fully reflect the nuance and complexity involved in what is a difficult, long-running legal saga involving very serious allegations of rape, assault, family breakdown, mental illness and drug abuse. (The following explication of the facts was taken from multiple Alabama court records, which Snopes obtained. Where there is a dispute or uncertainty over a claim or allegation, we note that. Snopes usually does not name survivors of rape and sexual assault, but we are naming Stallings in this article because she herself has decided to speak publicly).The visitation and custody dispute between Stallings and Barnett relates to two boys, aged 12 and 15 as of June 2019. Stallings gave birth to the younger boy in August 2006 and the older boy in July 2003. Stallings herself was born in April 1987, meaning she was 16 years old at the time her older son was born. Stallings turned 16 less than three months before giving birth to the boy, so by biological necessity she was 15 years old at the time of his conception. In Alabama, the age of consent is 16, as it was in 2002. These facts demonstrate that Stallings was, on at least one occasion, the subject of a statutory rape. She has alleged that Barnett raped her repeatedly throughout her teenage years. We asked Barnett’s attorney whether he denied these allegations, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. According to a later court filing by Stallings, Barnett was not listed as the father of either boy on their birth certificates. (We asked Stallings’ current attorney if we could view a copy of the birth certificates, but the attorney declined). In January 2008, Stallings and Barnett were married at the Jackson County Courthouse in Scottsboro, Ala. At the time, Stallings was 20 and Barnett was 27. By August, Stallings sued for divorce. In a court filing, her attorney at the time wrote that Stallings and Barnett had “become incompatible in their tastes, natures, views, likes and dislikes and their outlooks have become widely separated and divergent” to the extent that “it is impossible for them to live together as husband and wife.”In filing for divorce, Stallings did not state (as she later would) that she was coerced or pressured into marrying Barnett in the first place, nor did she make any allegation of rape against Barnett in any court filing associated with the divorce. (In March 2009, while the divorce was being processed, DeKalb County District Court records show that Stallings did apply for and obtain a restraining order against Barnett, claiming that he had sent her threatening text messages, had threatened to physically attack her and her boyfriend, had physically assaulted her in the past, and had threatened to kill her if she did not sign over custody of the children). Their divorce was finalized in November 2009. Under the terms of the divorce settlement, to which both Stallings and Barnett agreed, the two boys were described as “born to the parties” — that is, their children together. Barnett was given primary custody of the boys, while Stallings was given visitation rights on every second weekend, for a week around Christmas, a week during Spring Break and a week during June. Stallings and Barnett also divided up their custody of the boys on holidays such as Thanksgiving and on various birthdays. None of the June 2019 news articles about this case mentioned the fact that when Stallings and Barnett were divorced in 2009, Barnett — rather than Stallings — was given primary custody of the boys. Neither did the articles mention that, in filing for divorce, Stallings provided several grounds, but she never cited Barnett’s alleged repeated rape as one of them. These facts certainly do not mean Stallings’ 2019 allegations are not true, but they are relevant pieces of background information that would have provided readers with additional context and better reflected the complicated, long-running nature of Stallings’ and Barnett’s court battles. According to court records, Barnett was arrested and indicted on several criminal charges between 2010 and 2012, in both Alabama and Tennessee, including theft, assault and reckless endangerment. In one August 2010 incident, the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office said Barnett had attacked a corrections officer and attempted to take the officer’s weapon, while he was being transported to a mental-health hospital in Tennessee, before he fled into nearby woods. In 2014, Barnett was found not guilty “by reason of mental disease and defect” of two car thefts in Alabama, after he was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia. His attorney in the theft case said Barnett had told her he had been hospitalized at three other psychiatric facilities in Alabama. Barnett’s criminal activities and mental-health difficulties brought about a major development in the decade-long legal dispute between Stallings and Barnett, when Stallings petitioned the juvenile court in DeKalb County, seeking to change the custody arrangement in place between the two. The juvenile court records are sealed, but we have a reliable overview of what transpired after 2012, based on a summary published by the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals in April 2018:“In April 2012, [Stallings] filed in the DeKalb Juvenile Court (‘the juvenile court’) an emergency motion for custody of the children; she also filed two form complaints, which initiated a separate action for each child, seeking to have the children declared dependent and in which she alleged that [Barnett] had been arrested in Tennessee, had recently been committed to and released from a mental-health-care facility, had a history of mental-health issues and drug use, and, at a recent visitation, had ‘attempted to fight’ the mother.”So based on Barnett’s arrests, incarceration, and hospitalization, Stallings sought in 2012 to have the juvenile court declare the children dependent — a step commonly taken by juvenile courts when a legal guardian or parent, for various potential reasons, can no longer take care of a child — and also asked the court to give her custody of the children. She succeeded in taking over primary custody of the two boys, with Barnett retaining certain visitation rights, essentially reversing the arrangement that had been in place since the 2009 divorce settlement.The boys appear to have lived primarily with their mother since 2012, but further legal wrangling began in 2015, when Barnett petitioned the juvenile court to vacate the custody arrangement it had ordered three years earlier. This particular dispute was rather technical in nature, centering on whether the juvenile court had properly disposed of the request for a dependency declaration, before resolving the custody dispute. Both parties argued their cases before the juvenile court until 2017, when the matter was elevated to the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals. In April 2018, that court sided with Barnett’s argument and voided the juvenile court’s 2012 order.In 2017, two separate but parallel proceedings began. On the one hand, Stallings reported to the DeKalb County Sheriff’s Office an allegation that Barnett had repeatedly raped her. The Sheriff’s Office and the office of Alabama’s Ninth Judicial Circuit Court (which covers DeKalb County) launched an investigation into those allegations.Bob Johnston, chief deputy district attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit, told Snopes that, “There was no new information that would justify an additional presentation to the grand jury.” Stallings had made similar allegations of rape and incest against Barnett in 2015, allegations that she told the  she had made “soon after the custody fight began.” Those claims led to an earlier formal investigation and the empanelment of a grand jury. That grand jury decided not to indict Barnett in December 2015.On the other hand, Stallings took significant new steps, in civil court, to counteract Barnett’s efforts to change the custody arrangement in place since 2012, when DeKalb County Juvenile Court gave Stallings primary custody of the two boys. In January 2018, she petitioned the DeKalb County Circuit Court to annul her marriage to Barnett (declare it “void ab initio,” or invalid from the outset), and thereby to also void the 2009 divorce decree. Stallings argued that the 2008 marriage had been incestuous, because Barnett is her mother’s half-brother and therefore her own uncle “by half-blood,” which falls under Alabama’s legal definition of incest. The DeKalb County Circuit Court agreed to temporarily pause enforcement of the divorce decree, but as of June 2019 it had not given a final or permanent judgement on the validity of the marriage (and therefore the divorce settlement). This was in contrast to claims in various news reports that the court had “deemed the marriage illegal.”When the Court of Civil Appeals gave its ruling in April 2018, Stallings escalated her efforts to obtain custody of the boys. Because the appeals court vacated the juvenile court’s 2012 ruling (which gave Stallings primary custody), the only legitimate custody order in place would be the one contained in the 2009 divorce settlement, which gave Barnett primary custody. So while the court was considering Stallings’ motion to declare the marriage (and divorce settlement) void, she filed another motion in April 2018, this time asking the court for  custody — that is, for her to be given  custody of the children while the court decided on her underlying request to declare the marriage and divorce decree void. At the end of May 2018, Circuit Judge Shaunathan Bell ordered that, until a further hearing in September, the children would remain placed with Stallings, with Barnett allowed four hours of supervised visitation per week, at a Fort Payne facility operated by the DeKalb County Children’s Advocacy Center. In November 2018, Stallings and Barnett (through their respective attorneys) appeared to have come to a new unwritten arrangement in which Stallings retained primary custody of the boys, but Barnett was allowed a measure of unsupervised visitation rights. (No record of that agreement exists in the case docket, but Bell referenced it in a June 2019 ruling). On 30 May 2019, Barnett was arrested in Fort Payne, Ala., on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia. As a result, Stallings filed a new motion, asking Bell to set aside the unwritten November agreement that allowed Barnett unsupervised visitation of the children, claiming that her 12-year-old son had been in Barnett’s car with him when Barnett was arrested. We repeatedly asked Fort Payne Police Department for details of Barnett’s arrest, making several requests for a copy of the incident report. Unfortunately, we did not receive a substantive response in time for publication, meaning we cannot verify the boy’s having been present with Barnett at the time of the arrest. On 18 June 2019, Bell ordered Stallings and Barnett to return to the arrangement he had previously set down, meaning the boys would continue to be placed with Stallings for the foreseeable future, but Barnett would again be allowed four hours of supervised visitation per week. Bell scheduled what he called a final hearing on the underlying question of the validity of the 2008 marriage and 2009 divorce settlement, to take place on 12 August. The core claim made in multiple news reports in June 2019, and the claim submitted to Snopes for verification, was that a judge in Alabama had ordered a rape survivor (in this claim, Jessica Stallings) to allow the man who raped her (in this claim, Lenion Richard Barnett) to have visitation rights over her children. There is no doubt that DeKalb County Circuit Judge Shaunathan Bell has ordered that Barnett must temporarily be given limited rights to supervised visits with the two boys at the center of this case. (What the June 2019 news reports failed to mention was that Bell’s order did not come out of the blue, but rather after a decade of intensive and difficult legal wrangling between Stallings and Barnett, beginning with a 2009 divorce settlement that actually gave Barnett primary custody of the boys).It’s also true that Stallings’ eldest son was conceived when she was under the age of consent, meaning that she can be accurately described as a survivor of statutory rape. Furthermore, Barnett has repeatedly claimed visitation rights over that boy, based on a 2009 divorce settlement that described the children as being “born to” Barnett and Stallings. Clearly, this could lead a reasonable person to conclude that Barnett has, by implication, admitted to perpetrating a statutory rape against Stallings. However, . DNA testing could establish Barnett’s biological paternity of Stallings’ eldest son, but it’s not clear whether such DNA test results exist, or what they show, despite widely repeated claims in the June 2019 news coverage that DNA tests had “proven incest.”We asked Stallings’ attorney to provide any documentation, including DNA test results, which demonstrate that Barnett is the biological father of the two boys in question. The attorney declined to do so. We later asked the same attorney whether she or Stallings had possession of any such DNA test results. Stallings’ attorney told us that DNA testing had formed part of the criminal investigation into her client’s allegations against Barnett, but that she herself was “not privy” to that investigation. We asked the the Ninth Judicial Circuit District Attorney Office whether, as part of the investigations into Barnett, a DNA sample had been taken from him, whether testing had been done to check if he was the biological father of the children in question, and what the results of those tests were. Chief Deputy District Attorney Johnston told us, “It would be inappropriate for me to comment upon the evidence/lack of evidence …”In May 2018, Stallings’ attorney argued in a court filing that: “… DNA testing can establish the blood relationship between [Stallings] and [Barnett] as well as whether or not [Barnett] is the biological father of the children. It is the understanding and belief that there has been DNA seized as part of the criminal investigation.”As of 24 June 2019, no DNA test results demonstrating that Barnett is the biological father of Stallings’ eldest son had been submitted to the court as part of the ongoing custody dispute between the two, and neither Stallings’ attorney nor the District Attorney’s Office could provide Snopes such test results. Until and unless such results become available, we cannot verify the claim that Barnett perpetrated a statutory rape against Stallings, because we cannot verify whether Barnett is the biological father of Stallings’ eldest son. This might seem an odd conclusion, given that Barnett himself has repeatedly claimed custody over both boys, based on a 2009 divorce settlement that described the children as being “born to” Barnett and Stallings. However, the specific claim of statutory rape is contingent upon Barnett’s biological paternity of the eldest boy, and so far we have found no physical evidence of that. More broadly, Stallings has claimed that Barnett repeatedly raped her over the course of her teenage years. However, despite two formal investigations of those rape and incest allegations, one of which led to a grand jury being empanelled, Barnett has never been convicted, or even indicted, on charges of rape or incest. ",

        "evidence": "The online retailing giant Amazon.com came under scrutiny in March 2019 when reports emerged that their product listings had included “child sex dolls for pedophiles.” On 23 March, the right-leaning website PJ Media reported that:The article included screenshots of the dolls, and its author, Megan Fox, showed what appeared to be an authentic Amazon listing for one of the dolls in a live video she broadcast on 23 March. After her article was published, Fox updated it to reflect the fact that Amazon had removed the listings for the dolls from their website.A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed in a statement sent to Snopes that the dolls had indeed been listed but had since been removed, writing: “All Marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don’t will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The products in question are no longer available.”According to Fox’s account, provided in her live 23 March video, the items were removed from the website “within three minutes” of her article’s publication, which suggested that Amazon acted relatively promptly after they became aware of the products.We asked the company for a precise explanation of why the items highlighted by PJ Media had been removed, and whether those product listings constituted a violation of Amazon’s rules, but we did not receive a response to those particular questions.According to Amazon’s policies and rules, the company prohibits the sale of the following kinds of items (among others):The company warns of the following possible consequences for a seller who attempts to list one of the aforementioned product types and notes that the decision as to whether a product violates Amazon’s rules is largely at the discretion of the company:“Violations of Amazon’s listing policies may result in actions such as:Amazon reserves the right to make judgments in its sole discretion about whether or not a listing is appropriate.”It’s not clear what the specific basis was for Amazon’s decision to remove the two dolls discovered by PJ Media. As of 28 March, the seller who had listed the dolls was still active as an Amazon vendor. We asked the company why the seller in question had not been suspended or had their selling privileges revoked, but we did not receive a response to that particular question.As of 28 March, it was not illegal in the United States to buy or sell sex dolls that resemble children. However, on 27 March the Florida State Senate scheduled the third reading of a bill (SB 160) which would prohibit “knowingly selling, lending, giving away, distributing, transmitting, showing, or transmuting; offering to commit such actions; having in his or her possession, custody, or control with the intent to commit such actions; or advertising in any manner an obscene, child-like sex doll.”In 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 4655, known as the CREEPER Act, which would have banned the importation or transportation of “child sex dolls,” which the bill defined as “an anatomically-correct doll, mannequin, or robot, with the features of, or with features that resemble those of, a minor, intended for use in sexual acts.” The bill was sent to the U.S. Senate and referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 2018, but it did not advance from there.The bill argued that child sex dolls should be banned on the grounds that a correlation exists between the use and possession of such dolls and the consumption and production of child sex abuse imagery, that would-be predators could use such dolls to learn how to rape children, and that the dolls are “intrinsically related to abuse of minors, and they cause the exploitation, objectification, abuse, and rape of minors.”However, critics of such legislation have argued that the dolls are not “obscene material” in and of themselves, and that therefore a ban on them would be an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment right to free speech. Others have argued that no research-based consensus yet exists that the use of sex dolls facilitates or encourages the abuse of real children, as opposed to potentially making such crimes less likely.",

        "evidence": "In spring 2020, as Americans fought over the duration of government-imposed lockdowns to limit the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, critics of the rules on social distancing drew comparisons between U.S. officials’ response to the outbreak and that of leaders in other countries.\nAmong the critics was John McAfee, the controversial founder of the McAfee Antivirus software company and a cryptocurrency advocate (as well as 2020 U.S. presidential candidate for the Libertarian party). Aiming to call attention to what he viewed as unnecessary business closures and stay-at-home orders in the U.S. during the pandemic, he took to Twitter to highlight the rate at which people were dying from COVID-19 in New York City — the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak — compared to other major cities globally, specifically Tokyo. On April 25, 2020, he tweeted:\n\nHis assertion accurately makes the point that Japan is not under compulsory lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19. Rather, it is under a state of emergency, which empowers officials to request that residents stay home and businesses close. But —since the country’s post-World War II constitution bars officials from enforcing Wuhan-style shutdowns in the name of protecting residents’ civil liberties — government leaders cannot punish citizens if they don’t follow the recommendations on social distancing.\nThe day following the viral tweet, McAfee again authored claims that were similar in nature — posts that compared New York City’s pace of death to the average rate of large cities worldwide including Delhi and Mexico City — aiming to raise suspicion among his followers of the U.S. governments’ rationale for, as he put it, “shutting down and destroying the economies of the world.” Even Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk chimed in on the campaign, tweeting:\n\nMcAfee made several claims in his tweets, but we are focusing on whether New York’s death rate was truly 250 times “higher” than Tokyo’s as of April 25, 2020, and whether that pace increased over the following week.\nIt’s important to note at the start that this is a thorny comparison for a couple reasons: The cities’ populations vary depending on what geographic areas you consider, the regions’ processes for COVID-19 testing are different, and it’s unknown to what extent those testing practices influence government-compiled death tolls.\nOn May 1, Snopes reached out to McAfee to ask how he reached the calculation in the above-displayed tweet, and he answered with a phone call, emails, and direct messages on Twitter. One correspondence read:\n\nTo calculate the rate at which the novel coronavirus is killing in New York City, McAfee said he considered the metro’s population to be 8 million. (2018 census data show 8,398,748 New York residents.) But for Tokyo’s population, he said he used a population size of 23 million — a number that apparently includes not only people living within the city’s official boundaries (about 9.2 million) but also residents in surrounding jurisdictions.\nThat’s a step where the calculating gets murky. Like McAfee, the United Nations also measures Tokyo’s population as the sum of the entire metro area. But the U.N. documented more than 37 million residents as of 2018, not 23 million.\nFrom that point, McAfee said he divided his estimates for the cities’ populations by their total of COVID-19 deaths, respectively, and then compared the two death rates.\nWhile repeating that step for Snopes on May 1, he used about 13,000 for the number of deaths in New York City and about 97 deaths in Tokyo, totaling one COVID-19 death per 615 people in New York City and one death per roughly 237,000 people in Tokyo. Using that math by McAfee, as of May 1, New York City’s rate of death was about 385 times higher than Tokyo.\nBut to check his work, we first analyzed the New York City Health Department (NYC Health) criteria for counting fatalities. In March, when the department tallied the city’s first handful of deaths, it only considered fatalities of people who had tested positive for COVID-19 via a laboratory-sponsored test. That meant that, initially, patients who died at home and didn’t seek medical treatment were not included in the statistics. But in mid-April, the health department changed its system and also began tracking fatalities of people who had showed symptoms of COVID-19 but were never tested for it. \nAs of April 25, the day of McAfee’s viral tweet, NYC Health reported 17,393 deaths total, including both types of fatalities: people who had officially tested positive and those who medical examiners had determined “COVID-19” or the equivalent as their cause of death. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government documented less than 120 deaths.\nUsing those numbers and population estimates via the U.S. census and United Nations, NYC’s rate of COVID-19 deaths was almost 640 times greater than Tokyo’s as of April 25.\nBut, for several reasons, people should not take the government-compiled death tolls at face value. For one, the pace at which all local jurisdictions, whether in the U.S. or not, report deaths varies. Medical examiners can take days or weeks to process death certificates and compile that information for public records. Referring to the worldwide COVID-19 casualty count, Tim Riffe, a demographer at Germany’s Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, told The New York Times:\nWhatever number is reported on a given day is going to be a gross underestimate. […] In a lot of places the pandemic has been going on for long enough that there has been sufficient time for late death registrations to come in, giving us a more accurate picture of what the mortality really was.\nAdditionally, cities and countries have different criteria for administering COVID-19 tests, and residents in some locations have greater access to the testing compared to others. In Japan, officials have decided against widespread testing for COVID-19, “instead focusing on targeting clusters of infection when they appear in an effort to snuff out any further spread,” The Wall Street Journal reported.\nAs of May 5, Tokyo had tested roughly 12,500 people for COVID-19 and about 4,700 of them were positive, according to the city’s government, which is publishing its updates via an interactive web page. (For perspective, about 901,000 New York residents had been tested within roughly the same window.) In addition to excluding potential patients who are returning to the country via cruises or charter flights, the Tokyo statistics do not include people who showed mild-to-moderate symptoms — a shortness of breath, coughing or fever — and might have tested positive for COVID-19 if they had a test.\nProfessor Kenji Shibuya, who leads King’s College London’s Institution of Population Health, told BBC that from a physician’s viewpoint, Japan’s approach to testing makes sense: “Forget about mild cases, focus on cases with major symptoms and save lives. Focus testing on those who have symptoms.”\nBut it also means the total number of infections in the country, including in Tokyo, are likely far greater than what public health officials are reporting and do not lend themselves to an apples-to-apples comparison with other cities, such as New York City. \n“We are definitely missing a lot of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases,” Shibuya told BBC of the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. “There is clearly widespread community transmission. I am very worried by this situation.”\nWhat’s undetermined is to what extent the differences in testing for COVID-19 between Tokyo and New York impact their death tolls. In other words, it’s unclear how many people in each city have been fatally infected with the novel coronavirus yet do not appear in government-certified mortality statistics, whether because they didn’t seek medical help or didn’t receive a COVID-19 test.\nIn the interview with Snopes, McAfee agreed: No one quite knows the exact number of infections in both places, and so accurately calculating the rate of disease is impossible. But he argued that tabulating the rate of COVID-19 deaths is a different story, since he believes government officials, especially in Japan, are tracking and publicly releasing every COVID-19 death. He said:\nIn Japan, if you know anything of that country, there is not a death anywhere from anything remotely resembling a lower respiratory tract infection, which is not tested (for COVID-19) … which is why I picked Tokyo… There’s not a doctor in this world who would question the Japanese medical death number, good heavens. You know how many people investigate every death and disease in Japan? So that [issue of COVID-19 patients dying in Tokyo without being included in the public death toll numbers] cannot happen.\nNow, if it’s happening in New York, that just makes it even worse — then [the rate of death] is thousands times greater than Tokyo’s. You can’t reason out of this … numbers don’t lie.\nWhether or not it “cannot happen” (as McAfee claims) that COVID-19 patients in Tokyo have died without being included in the public death toll, the disparity between the death rate per population in Tokyo versus New York is large enough that it’s unlikely any corrections to the basic data could negate it entirely. The nagging question is why the disparity exists and what it really tells us. McAfee leaps to the suggestion that there is “something fishy here,” implying nefarious reasons for the disparity, but a serious analysis would require more and better data, and consideration within the wider context of drastically varying COVID-19 mortality rates across all major regions. ",

That’s because the first few seconds of this video come from a news report about the death of a different celebrity: chef Anthony Bourdain.\nHere’s the original news report:\n\nWhoever created the fraudulent video took the first few seconds from CNN’s report on Bourdain’s death, changed the chyron to read about Dion, and then cut the footage short and replaced it with an image of the singer.\nWe should also note that this fake video started circulating on or prior to Nov. 3, 2019. Since then, Dion has held concerts in Milwaukee and Detroit, something that would be difficult to do after dying in a plane crash:\nThank you Detroit for an incredible evening! We’ll be on stage on Nov. 18 in Montreal! Can’t wait!🔥💫/Merci Détroit pour la soirée incroyable! Nous remontons sur scène le 18 nov. prochain à Montréal! J’ai tellement hâte ! 🔥💫- Céline xx… #CourageWorldTour\n📸 : Brian Purnell pic.twitter.com/jO0L7GodSW\n— Celine Dion (@celinedion) November 6, 2019\n\nThis isn’t the first time she has been the target of a death hoax.

        "evidence": "South African comedian Trevor Noah often talks about growing up under apartheid as the child of a black mother and white father. So if it seems a stretch that the famously mixed-race host of Comedy Central’s long-running parody news program “The Daily Show” would call on non-whites to unite in anger against white people in South Africa, it’s because he didn’t.\nThe fake quote attributed to Noah has been circulating on the internet, in varying forms and countries, since at least 2017, according to an investigation by Digital Forensic Research Lab, a project of the international affairs think tank Atlantic Council, which traces the sources of online disinformation.\nIn a nutshell, the quote calls on immigrants and black South Africans to unite in their anger toward white South Africans, who control most of the country’s wealth. “Whites in South Africa makes up about 8.7% of the population and controls over 85% wealth,” the quote states, then continues, “I say that your anger and outrage is misplaced. African immigrants don’t own lands, don’t run companies, don’t operate trophy hunting companies, do not ship out capital to European banks.”\nIt’s a toxic quote, considering that its spread online coincides with deadly xenophobic violence in South Africa. And even though it isn’t authentic, it spread on various African websites and on social media.\nThe sharing of the quote to U.S. readers got a boost from frequent purveyors of online disinformation, including Alex Jones’ conspiracy site Infowars, as well as Jim Hoft, who runs the junk news site Gateway Pundit, and Jack Posobiec, a right-wing internet personality who helped spread the Pizzagate conspiracy theory.\n\nThe quote has changed over time. According to the Digital Forensic Research Lab, the earliest version of it has been on the internet since Feb. 20, 2017, when a Nigerian website published it and attributed it to Noah without any citations. It was then reproduced by a Malawian website with the claim that Noah gave the markedly unfunny monologue while hosting his comedy show.\nThe quote hadn’t seen much activity since early 2017 but then reemerged with the start of violence targeting immigrants in South Africa in early September 2019.\nIn 2017, Noah made a comment about race but it was the inverse of the fake one attributed to him. Noah told Canadian broadcaster CBC that apartheid represents one of the easiest forms of control, accomplished by “[convincing people] that they are different — even black people by the way — and [separating] them into groups that now spend more time trying to fight each other than realizing that they all share a common goal.”\nNoah also authored a book entitled “Born a Crime” about his experience growing up under apartheid as a mixed-race child, as his parents’ union at the time was a violation of South African law under apartheid.\nFor reference, the version of the quote circulating in the U.S. as of this writing states in full:\nThere are about 2.3 million immigrants living in South Africa, this number includes other Africans, Chinese, Bangladeshi, Indians, middle easterners and Europeans who are not born in SA. out of this number, only 1.6 million are Africans. The 1.6 MILLION Africans mostly run small shops, vending, service industries, etc. They may lay claim to less than 0.00001% of wealth in SA.\nWhites in South Africa makes up about 8.7% of the population and controls over 85% wealth. Though there are increases in black CEOs and managers, these are mere servants and just a optical presentations. There are about 6000 European families who own over 85% of agricultural lands in south Africa. So when I hear south Africans claiming that other Africans are competing with them on dwindling/scarce resources, I say that your anger and outrage is misplaced. African immigrants don’t own lands, don’t run companies, don’t operate trophy hunting companies, do not ship out capital to European banks.\nYours is a misplaced anger, prejudice and xenophobia built up out of inferiority complex created by decades of apartheid and oppression. I don’t see fellow African as a competitor but a fellow compatriot who is struggling to feed his family and have some comfort in this short life-time. If you feel undeserved in wealth distribution, please research again who controls that wealth and it has nothing to do with some Nigerian, Zimbabwean or Mozambican working in a restaurant or Ethiopian running a small shop, or a Ghanaian mechanic working hard in the sun.

        "evidence": "In January 2020, readers asked us about the accuracy of reports that claimed officials in a county in Michigan had threatened to demolish more than a dozen homes in a local Amish community unless their owners upgraded them in a way that is antithetical to their religious beliefs. \nOn Dec. 20, 2019, The Daily Sheeple published an article with the headline “Michigan County Threatens to Demolish 14 Amish Homes Unless They Give Up Their Religious Beliefs and Upgrade Their Homes.” The article reported that:\nAfter harassing the Amish community for years regarding its water supply and disposal, the county health department posted signs on the Amish families’ homes earlier this year condemning them as “unfit for human habitation” and filed lawsuits against 14 Amish families in November. If successful, the lawsuits would result in the demolition of the Amish families’ homes and would effectively banish an entire religious community from Lenawee County. The ACLU and Wright & Schulte filed answers to those lawsuits Wednesday in Lenawee County Circuit Court, which include counterclaims against the county for religious discrimination in violation of the federal and state constitutions and the federal Fair Housing Act.\nThe following day, the right-leaning website DC Dirty Laundry re-published the same article. \nSetting aside a measure of editorialization, the factual claims contained in the article were highly accurate, which is perhaps not surprising because they were entirely plagiarized from a Dec. 18 press release published by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is representing the Amish families in question. \nIn November, the Lenawee County Health Department filed a lawsuit in Lenawee Circuit Court, asking the judge to enforce what the department had determined were numerous breaches of several county health code regulations around sewage disposal and running water at 14 Amish-owned homes in Morenci, Michigan. \nAccording to the complaint filed by the county, health officials began their investigations into the homes after a complaint was filed in June 2015. Upon visiting the homes, health inspectors found what they determined to be an unsafe absence of a proper sewage-disposal system and running water, constituting violations of county health code regulations.\nOn that basis, the county began a near four-year process of attempting to enforce the requirements of the health code and getting the homes upgraded to be in compliance, a process the complaint described as futile, because the Amish families in question refused to make the requested installations. \nThe stand-off came to a head in July 2019, when the county health department issued an order for the families to vacate the properties. The county concluded that the buildings are “unfit for habitation” and in violation of multiple health code regulations; that neighboring properties were being harmed by the improper disposal of sewage on the surface of the ground; and that “injury to persons, particularly children, is highly probable.” \nOn that basis, the complaint asked the circuit court to issue an injunction preventing the Amish families from building any further properties that are not compliant with health regulations, and giving them 30 days in which to bring their homes into compliance with the health code, or to demolish them. The county has further requested that if the families do neither, the county should be authorized to demolish the homes, and that the families should bear the costs associated with the demolition. \nIn this respect, the ACLU press release  — and by extension the posts published by The Daily Sheeple and DC Dirty Laundry — accurately stated that Lenawee County had threatened to demolish the Amish families’ homes. \nFor their part, the families’ have submitted to the court that the county’s enforcement of the health code regulations constitutes a violation of their First Amendment right to live in accordance with the requirements of their religious faith. In a series of counter-claims filed on Dec. 18, 2019, the families outlined the religious reasons for their non-compliance with the county’s orders:\nAmish religious observances include simple living and rejection of modern technology. Because of their religious beliefs, Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange obtain all of the water used in their home from a manually operated well on their property. Consistent with these beliefs and methods, they use a minimal amount of water in their homes, far less than is common among most modern homeowners. Consistent with these beliefs, Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange also do not utilize modern indoor plumbing; instead Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange use what is commonly referred to as an outhouse, or outdoor privy, for elimination of human waste/black water.\nThe method by which Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange provide water to their home and dispose of their black water and grey water is sufficient for their and their family’s needs and does not present a health or safety threat to them, their family, their neighbors, or the public at large. Lenawee County health officials have been made aware by Defendants, and other members of the Amish community, of their religious views.\nUpon information and belief, Plaintiff seeks to impose certain black water disposal, grey water disposal, plumbing, and water supply requirements at the Premises that would require Defendants to include system design, mechanical equipment, or other devices, construction techniques, or implementation methods that would violate Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange’s religious beliefs and practices. Upon information and belief, Plaintiff seeks to impose certain black water disposal, grey water disposal, plumbing, and water supply requirements at the Premises that would require Defendants to include system design, mechanical equipment, or other devices, construction techniques, or implementation methods that are wholly unnecessary, especially when properly viewed in conjunction with their religious beliefs and practices.\nAmong other things, removal of human excreta from their outdoor privy through mechanical means such as pumping would violate Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange’s sincerely held religious beliefs and practices; instead, their religion dictates that they remove the human excreta through their own toil.\nIn constitutional jurisprudence, First Amendment rights are not regarded as being absolute. The right to free speech, political association, assembly, protest, and to exercise one’s religious faith do not, in all cases, outweigh any other consideration. However, the courts have established that the state must have a “compelling interest” in curtailing such freedoms, in order for such a restriction to be constitutionally acceptable. \nIn the Lenawee case, the ACLU has argued on behalf of the families that, because (they contend) there is no risk or a low risk of harm from the existing sewage-disposal methods used by the families, the state does not have a compelling interest in forcing the families to contravene their own religious beliefs by upgrading their sewage systems. ",

        "evidence": "A blog post that went viral in December 2019 created the false impression that the U.S. Supreme Court had issued a “landmark decision” favoring President Donald Trump in ongoing impeachment proceedings against him, thereby dealing a blow to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\nThe post, “Supreme Court Ends Pelosi’s Reign of Terror with Landmark Decision on Impeachment,” was published on Dec. 17, 2019, and reported that “Nancy Pelosi just got spanked by the Supreme Court in a new impeachment ruling.” However, the story did not support what the headline proclaimed.\nThe Supreme Court has issued no such ruling on ongoing impeachment proceedings. In mid-December 2019, the court agreed to review three separate lower-court rulings against the president that upheld subpoenas from House of Representatives committees seeking Trump’s financial records, and a decision that ordered Trump’s accounting firm to turn over records to prosecutors in New York City. The cases will not be heard until March 2020, thus no ruling has yet been issued.\nAs the law blog SCOTUSblog noted of the issue:\nThe subpoena to Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars, came from the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, while the subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Capital One, two of Trump’s lenders, came from the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees. The committees said that they wanted the records as part of their work, but Trump argued that the subpoenas do not serve a “legitimate legislative purpose,” as the Supreme Court’s cases require.\n[A] subpoena from Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance also went to Mazars. As Steve Vladeck has previously reported for this blog, Vance is seeking several years’ worth of Trump’s tax returns as part of a state grand-jury investigation. After the lower courts rejected his efforts to quash the subpoena, Trump went to the Supreme Court, arguing that the subpoena violates the president’s absolute immunity from state criminal proceedings while he is in office.\nTrump is facing impeachment proceedings over allegations that he attempted to leverage his public office for personal gain in a scheme to extract damaging information from Ukraine on a potential 2020 electoral rival by withholding military aid to that country. The House voted to impeach Trump on Dec. 18, 2019, on a party-line vote, for abuse of power and obstructing Congress.\nBecause the headline of the story falsely claims that the Supreme Court had ruled against Pelosi (and in favor of Trump) on impeachment-related cases when it did not, we are rating this claim “False.”",

The Adelsons poured $113 million into Republican causes during the 2018 midterm-election cycle after donating $20 million to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and $5 million toward his inauguration ceremonies.According to IRS documents available online, the Adelsons also donated to the Patriot Legal Defense Fund Trust, launched in 2018 for the purpose of helping Trump associates who were prosecuted in an ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with their legal fees.The fund “was formally established in the State of Delaware on February 27, 2018, operating as a tax-exempt political organization under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code.”Whether Dr. Adelson was given the Medal of Freedom as  for her family’s massive political contributions and gift to the legal defense fund is unknown.

        "evidence": "During America’s growing political divide over policing, a video surfaced online in September 2020 showing a gunman shooting two Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies in the head as they sat in a squad car.\nNumerous viewers of the seven-second clip believed the apparent ambush — which sent the deputies to the hospital in critical condition — was a result of the momentum among civil rights activists to eliminate unjust killings of Black Americans by authorities, also known as the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, as well as supporters of it. Sharing the video with her roughly 2.6 million followers, for example, conservative provocateur Candace Owens wrote on Twitter:\n“Why else does this [shooting of deputies] happen? … BLACK LIVES MATTER AND THE COMPLICIT MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS, ATHLETES, AND ENTERTAINERS ARE TO BLAME.”\nBelow, we unpack that claim — which is ultimately a product of an expansive fear-mongering campaign by deceptive media sources to paint the BLM movement as a social force that doesn’t match reality. \nAdditionally, hours after the Compton shooting, another layer to the controversy emerged: Reports on social media alleged BLM protesters taunted law enforcement officers standing guard outside the hospital where the deputies were receiving medical treatment, and blocked emergency access to the facility:\n\nThe Epoch Times, a media outlet laden with misinformation that has effectively served to help U.S. President Donald Trump’s political agenda since 2016, claimed:\n“Black Lives Matter protesters blocked a hospital entrance in Los Angeles on Saturday night and yelled, ‘we hope they die,’ hours after a man shot two county deputies in an ambush.”\nBased on our analysis of videos of the shooting and protests, as well as first-person accounts and news reports, these assertions were a blend of fact and distortions of reality — presented in memes such as the one displayed below that aimed to dissuade people against supporting the NFL because of its alleged support for protesters who gathered outside the hospital:\n\nWhile some football players were indeed supporters or leaders of the BLM movement, no evidence linked them or the league with the events in Los Angeles. Any social media post that claimed “the NFL will honor and praise the organization that stood out outside [the] hospital chanting” was at best a misleading attempting to connect dots that didn’t exist. At worst, it was a purposeful attempt to discredit an initiative by the NFL to recognize systemic racism by erroneously linking it to the gathering outside the California medical facility.\nThis information is undeniably true: Two deputies, a 31-year-old female and 24-year-old male, were shot at close range while sitting in a patrol car near the Compton sheriff’s station south of downtown Los Angeles on Sept. 12 around 7 p.m.\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters the female deputy was a mother of a 6-year-old boy — like the meme about the NFL suggested — and that both deputies graduated law enforcement training in the same class, just 14 months prior to the shooting.\nThe department released the above-mentioned footage that went viral and apparently depicted the incident. The video showed a gunman wearing dark clothing casually approaching the passenger side of the squad car, raising his gun inches from the window, firing several rounds and then running away.\n“The gunman walked up on the deputies and opened fire without warning or provocation,” the department tweeted.\nUpdate: The gunman walked up on the deputies and opened fire without warning or provocation. pic.twitter.com/cBQjyKkoxJ\n— LA County Sheriffs (@LASDHQ) September 13, 2020\n\nAn extended version of the surveillance video obtained by The Los Angeles Times showed the shooter fleeing in the direction from which he came and running past someone nearby on a sidewalk, although it was unclear if, or to what extent, that person was involved in the surprise attack.\nMeanwhile, an Instagram video by an apparent witness to the shooting showed the squad car from the front, several people walking on a nearby sidewalk with their phones out, and emergency vehicles arriving to help the wounded deputies. The narrator in that video said:\nTwo sheriffs shot in the face, they tripping. It’s going up in Compton. [Expletive] just bust on the police. […] Somebody ran up on the car and busted on their ass, right through the window, in their face and all.\nMany who shared the footage assumed the narrator was an “activist” and took him to be wrongfully celebrating the shooting. “These ‘activists’ are celebrating the attempted executions of two police officers in Compton,” one person tweeted:\nThese “activists” are celebrating the attempted executions of two police officers in Compton.  pic.twitter.com/zNvTbU4AIa\n— Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) September 14, 2020\n\nThe Instagram account on which that video originated was deleted after conservatives circulated it widely — leveraging it for their political message — so we have no evidence to verify its legitimacy. We also have no evidence to confirm or disprove the claim that the narrator is an “activist” or in any way associated with the BLM movement. \nMoments after the gunfire, medics took the deputies — whom the department had not identified as of this writing — to the St. Francis Medical Center, where they underwent surgery. The following day, the hospital listed them in stable condition, and they were expected to recover from multiple gunshot wounds.\nBoth Trump and the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden were quick to condemn the shooting of law enforcement, though their messages varied. Biden said:\nThis cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.\nViolence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished.\nJill and I are keeping the deputies and their loved ones in our hearts and praying for a full recovery. https://t.co/330QfeIUGg\n— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 13, 2020\n\nTrump, meanwhile, retweeted the sheriff’s department’s video of the shooting, with the comment: “Animals that must be hit hard!” Later, he added:\nIf they die, fast trial death penalty for the killer. Only way to stop this! https://t.co/K3sKh28GjX\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2020\n\nCritical to the rumors aiming to spear the BLM movement was this: The intentions of the gunman were unknown, as of this report. No one had come forward to explain the shooter’s motivations behind the attack, nor his whereabouts.\nOn Sept. 14, the sheriff’s department announced a $175,000 reward for information to answer such questions leading to an arrest. In regards to the deputies’ relationship with the suspect — whom the department described as a Black man between the ages of 28 and 30 years old — the sheriff told reporters: “To my knowledge, they had no knowledge of this individual. No provocation. No conflict. Nothing. It was just cold blooded ambush.”\nIn other words, very few details were known about the suspect, and the shooting appeared to be random, per Villanueva.\nThat meant any assumption about the gunman’s social or political affiliations would breach verified fact, as well as any assertion that those alleged beliefs drove the gunman to open fire on the deputies.\nThat is all to say, no evidence connected the shooting — or the suspected gunman — to any organization or cause, including the BLM movement like some viral posts claimed.\nIn fact, leaders within the movement sought to distance themselves from the spontaneous violence. For example, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing several high-profile cases alleging wrongful use of force by police against Black Americans that have sparked BLM protests across the country — including the family of a man fatally shot by the LA sheriff’s department — tweeted:\n“We WILL hold [the sheriff’s department] accountable for systemic brutality. But violence — including the shooting of two deputies in LA — is NOT the answer. I urge anyone with info about this incident should come forward.”\nIn the hours after the shooting, roughly five protesters gathered outside the hospital where the deputies were being treated, and law enforcement officers created a barricade there to supposedly keep the protesters from entering the facility.\nWe uncovered these facts about the scene, primarily based on video evidence:\nA tense situation developing in Lynwood as a handful of protesters on sidewalk shout at deputies outside St. Francis medical center where 2 deputies are recovering from surgery after being shot tonight in Compton pic.twitter.com/wwpcnVFvOI\n— Josie Huang (@josie_huang) September 13, 2020\n\nDuring the ordeal, the sheriff’s office said on Twitter protesters were “blocking the entrance & exit of the hospital emergency room,” and one witness told a local news station that some protesters tried to get inside the facility, though no visual evidence confirmed that was indeed the case.\nTo the protesters blocking the entrance & exit of the HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM yelling \\\"We hope they die\\\" referring to 2 LA Sheriff's ambushed today in #Compton: DO NOT BLOCK EMERGENCY ENTRIES & EXITS TO THE HOSPITAL. People's lives are at stake when ambulances can't get through.\n— LA County Sheriffs (@LASDHQ) September 13, 2020\n\nRather, video footage showed a handful of deputies standing in a driveway (apparently an entrance to the hospital’s emergency room), while the small group of protesters paced up and down a sidewalk feet away from them.\nAt one point, deputies detained a journalist with LA’s NPR station, KPCC, who was reporting on the small protest, as well as a male protester who “refused to comply” with deputies’ demands to leave the area.\nThe sheriff’s department said the reporter, Josie Huang, ignored deputies’ repeated commands and did not present “proper” press credentials. But she said and videos of her arrest show she didn’t have time or space to react to deputies orders before they shoved her and forcefully took her into custody. In one video, she can be heard shouting “I’m a reporter… I’m with KPCC” as officers push her to the ground. They cited her with obstructing justice, though KPCC is urging authorities to drop the charge.\nThank you https://t.co/5ajOiRV1m6 for what is the clearest footage of my arrest by @LASDHQ. \nIt’s how I remember it — like being tossed around in the ocean and then slammed into rock pic.twitter.com/G3rfCR1NiI\n— Josie Huang (@josie_huang) September 14, 2020\n\nIn a Facebook video posted Sept. 13, Kevin Wharton Price, a founder of an LA-based Black rights group called the Africa Town Coalition, identified himself as the protester whom deputies arrested — as well as an organizer of the small gathering outside the hospital.\nHe said he and three other people went to the facility to call attention to an alleged gang of deputies within the sheriff’s department that control aspects of the agency, as well as the series of senseless killings of Black people by authorities over the years. And while BLM and Africa Town Coalition share some similar goals, such as empowering Black Americans, he said they have separate ideologies, and the latter group should not be conflated with the former. Price said:\n“Africa Town came with four people that night. Four people. That was it. …We are not Black Lives Matter. […] We have our own political agenda.”\nIn addition, he said the rumor that protesters were trying to break into the hospital was false. He said:\nIn the news and some white supremacists are saying that there were Black Lives Matter protesters out there, trying to block the driveway of the hospital, the emergency hospital area, and allegedly trying to force their way in to the emergency room. […] We did not go to force our way in to anywhere. We went out there to deliver a message to these gang-banging sheriff’s department that we’re not going to shed a tear because two of your gang-banging sheriffs got shot in the head.\n\nIn sum, a group that is not BLM organized the small protest outside the hospital where two deputies received treatment for gunshot wounds, and tried to provoke law enforcement officers standing guard there. No visual evidence confirmed those protesters blocked an emergency access to the facility, though the sheriff’s department reported that was the case. Also, no evidence linked the suspect in the supposed ambush of deputies to the BLM movement, as of this writing. For those reasons, we rate this claim as “Mostly false.”",

The organization last assessed the Spix’s macaw on Aug. 7, 2018, prior to the aforementioned study first published online on Sept. 1, 2018. In their paper, the scientists described the last known sightings of Spix’s macaw in the wild:\nLast known from near the rio São Francisco in north Bahia, Brazil, where only three birds remained in 1985–1986, and these were captured for trade in 1987 and 1988. However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw (Propyrrhura maracana), was discovered at the site in July 1990, and survived until the end of 2000. There have been no subsequent records of wild birds, despite searches and fieldworker presence in the area. An observation in 2016 in the Curaca area is believed to relate to a release from captivity. Loss of gallery woodland and trapping for the cagebird trade likely drove declines.\nWhile wild individuals have likely not been seen since 2000, a captive population of about 60 or 70 species in the hands of both breeding programs and private owners still exists. In 2018, the Brazilian government announced that a population of around 50 Spix’s macaws from Europe would be transferred to a reintroduction facility in Brazil:\nThe current batch of survivors being repatriated from Europe will initially stay in a special center due to open in Berlin next Thursday, where they will be prepared for the transition. They will then move to a 72-acre reintroduction center in a conservation area of Brazil’s north-eastern state of Bahia, with the first being released into the wild in 2021. Brazil’s environment ministry said that international breeding programs for the birds in captivity have seen the population grow from 79 in 2012 to 158 this year.\nThe number of blue-named and/or blue-colored macaws has created some internet confusion about what birds are — and are not —endangered or extinct. A viral meme from the French Facebook page Jadore Les Animaux, for example, shared a picture of a blue-colored macaw with the text: “The world is in mourning. The blue macaw has been declared extinct.”\n\nFirst, while there are multiple species of blue macaws, “blue macaw” is not the common or informal name for any of them. The closest match to that name would be the blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna), whose population is not threatened.\nSecondly, as Agence France-Presse noted in a fact check of that viral post, the species shown in the photo was actually a different species of macaw known as the hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus). This species is classified as “vulnerable” by the IUCN.\nBut because scientists have determined the wild population of Spix’s macaw to be likely extinct in the wild, we rate the claim about the bird species fictionalized in the “Rio” movies as “True.”",
        "claim": "The macaw species from the “Rio” movies has been declared extinct in the wild. ",
        "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."

        "evidence": "An image widely circulated on Facebook in response to the National Football League’s anthem controversy held that NFL players did not stand on the sidelines during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games prior to 2009. Instead, they stayed in locker rooms during the anthem and did not begin standing along the sidelines for renditions of “The Star-Spangled Banner” until after the Defense Department began paying the NFL to hold patriotic displays in 2009:The issue has been in the public spotlight ever since San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began protesting police brutality by kneeling during the playing of the national anthem during exhibition games played prior to the start of the 2016 NFL season. Several other players, including some in other sports, have since taken part in similar silent demonstrations during the 2016 and 2017 seasons.Tom E. Curran of Comcast Sportsnet New England reported in a story published on 29 August 2016 that teams standing together on the field during the playing of the national anthem was a relatively recent development in NFL history: “NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed this the practice began in 2009, adding, ‘As you know, the NFL has a long tradition of patriotism. Players are encouraged but not required to stand for the anthem.'”What actually changed in 2009, according to NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, was that (due to network timing issues) players had previously remained in their locker rooms during the playing of the national anthem for  games.  After 2009, players appeared in the sidelines for the anthem during primetime games, just as they had been doing all along for Sunday afternoon games.  (The distinction often went unnoticed by viewers, as network telecasts frequently didn’t air the pre-game anthem ceremonies.) ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith referenced Currant’s report during a segment on 14 September 2016, adding a “paid patriotism” element to the mix:The practice of “paid patriotism” came to light on 30 April 2015, when Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) released a statement chiding the New Jersey Army National Guard for paying between $97,000 and $115,000 to the New York Jets for a series of promotions involving military personnel. That November, Flake and fellow Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain issued a report stating that the Defense Department had been paying for patriotic displays in football and other sports between 2011 and 2014:However, this report did not cover the year 2009, so it is unclear whether NFL teams’ appearing on the field for the playing of the national anthem truly began in conjunction with the “paid patriotism” policy. In a September 2017 piece about the anthem controversy, CNN noted that: The league announced in May 2016 that they would refund $723,724 to taxpayers which they said “may have been mistakenly applied to appreciation activities rather than recruitment efforts” during the years in question.",
        "claim": "NFL players did not stand for the national anthem until the Defense Dept. started paying the league to stage patriotic displays in 2009.",
        "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."
