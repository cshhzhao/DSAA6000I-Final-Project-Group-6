One of the most comprehensive studies of recent active shooter events suggests the average of 18 deaths when police stop the shooter is far too high. The study of more than 100 incidents determined the median number of people killed or wounded in all active shooter situations was five. The study documented only nine incidents out of dozens in which the number of people shot was 14 or higher. Conclusions about the number of deaths when an armed civilian takes action are also problematic because very limited data exists. The author of the study agrees it\u2019s logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun.

His office pointed us to various documents that analyzed the problem of improper payments, an issue that mixes fraud together with nominally legal activities such as referring patients for more tests than are necessary. This suggested Roskam was using an inflated estimate of fraud. However, a recent study tends, in the worst-case analysis, to support Roskam\u2019s figures. Roskam\u2019s comparison to credit cards overlooks many key differences between the structures of the health care and credit card industries, and it tends to obscure the systematic nature of fraud in health care, whether public or private.

He once said that he wouldn't run for Senate as an independent, and then said he would support the Republican nominee. But this fact check is about more than flip-flopping. It's about Crist attacking Rubio for the very same positions Crist held just six months ago. There, the case is much more difficult to make. When it comes to health care, Social Security, immigration, embryonic stem cell research and Roe vs. Wade, we find Crist's positions are either unchanged, or he hasn't used them as a line of attack against Rubio. But gay adoption is a slightly different story. Crist said he supported keeping the gay adoption ban in place as a Republican as recently as eight months ago, but now says he supports the ban being lifted. And he's using that new position to link Rubio to a tea party favorite like Jim DeMint in order to bolster the argument that Rubio's extreme. The caveat is that as far back as 2006 Crist was accused by Republicans of supporting gay adoptions in Florida and has given differing statements on the issue. In that case, Crist's flip-flopping helps his argument.

To the contrary, the report takes pains to note that virtually all of those people will be working less due to their own choices, such as opting to receive higher federal subsidies for care rather than working more to boost their wages. The CBO said it\u2019s not projecting the law would cause a bump in unemployment or underemployment. The report does not paint a rosy picture of the economy and it can be easy to miss the distinction between people leaving jobs because they want to as opposed to being laid off.

People making $200,000 or less a year would see their taxes rise by an average of about $2,000. The study is making the point that Romney\u2019s plan is untenable: to cut rates that much without adding to the deficit, something has to give.

We spend too much money on health care. The fiscal future is ultimately unsustainable. It is in the matter of foreign policy that Romney lays out the most aggressive case against Obama, warning that the United States needs to maintain its military dominance in the world, particularly in the face of threats from China, Russia and Islamic jihadists. Obama, Romney writes, needs to \\\"proudly defend her rather than continually apologize for her.\\\" Here, we're checking Romney's statement that Obama \\\"has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision\\\" and a host of other reasons. If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney's criticisms. We set out to discover whether Obama really had apologized in his speeches, and what he was apologizing for. But in our review of his words, we came up short. Yes, there is criticism in some of his speeches, but it's typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and often he mentions other countries and how they have erred as well.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns goes a step further in saying Wolf \\\"voted to allow terror suspects to buy guns.\\\" That\u2019s an inflammatory statement that suggests Wolf put gun rights ahead of protecting the nation from terrorists. It ignores Wolf\u2019s spurned offer in 2011 to work with the sponsor of the amendment to find a compromise that could keep guns away from suspected terrorists while protecting the rights of those who have been unfairly placed on the government\u2019s watch list.

Requiring the state to clear a foster child's credit history before he or she graduates from state custody seems like a good policy. Representative Langevin said, \\\"Foster children are disproportionately victims of identity theft.\\\" The concept is apparently widely believed and asserted among child advocates.

Of the two studies we found that looked at overall childhood rates, one showed a rate of identity theft that was similar to foster children. The second found a rate that was higher than the rate seen in the study of foster children. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a fake news detection task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: Romney's website said that women account for 92.3 percent of jobs lost under Obama. By comparing job figures with January 2009 and March 2012 and weighing them against women\u2019s job figures from the same periods, Saul came up with 92.3 percent. First, Obama cannot be held entirely accountable for the employment picture on the day he took office, just as he could not be given credit if times had been booming. Second, by choosing figures from January 2009, months into the recession, the statement ignored the millions of jobs lost before then, when most of the job loss fell on men. In every recession, men are the first to take the hit, followed by women. It's a historical pattern, Stevenson told us, not an effect of Obama's policies. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said much of the decline for women was in the public sector. \\\"To the extent there have been excessive job losses among women, a lot of it has to do with the fact that there has been an enormous reduction in state and local government employment,\\\" Bartlett said. \\\"The decline ... has been especially pronounced in this recession as opposed to other recessions.\\\" This chart from the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed group, bears that out. In earlier recessions, public-sector jobs began increasing again as the economy stabilized. After the most recent recession, they have continued to disappear. Again, these are jobs heavily held by women. Bartlett added that many of those government jobs were eliminated in states controlled by Republican governors and legislatures. This story in the Atlantic cited a study by the liberal Roosevelt Institute finding that the 11 states that went Republican in 2010 accounted for 40.5 percent of all state and local government job losses. Jeff Hayes is a senior research analyst with the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, an organization affiliated with George Washington University\u2019s public policy graduate program that receives contributions from groups including the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Hayes added that \\\"there\u2019s a lag before the lost tax revenue catches up and government jobs are lost. \\\"If you break out the 683,000 jobs women lost between January 2009 and March 2012, 64 percent were in government and only 36 percent in the private sector.\\\" That leads us to a point made by Eileen Appelbaum with the left-leaning Center on Economic and Policy Research. She noted that after the first wave of money in the president\u2019s stimulus bill had run out, Obama asked for another $23 billion in \\\"emergency aid\\\" for state and local governments. The money was sought to avert the layoffs of as many as 300,000 public school teachers, but House Republican leaders stripped it. \\\"You could hardly blame Obama for that,\\\" Appelbaum said. As for the comparison with the PolitiFact Georgia item, such direct comparisons are tricky. The Associated Press said using the 92.3 percent figure as a measure of Obama\u2019s record on women was \\\"dubious at best.\\\" First Read, a politics blog by NBC News, had this to say: \\\"Does anyone believe, with a straight face, that nine in 10 job losses over the past three years have been women workers?\\\" And the New York Times disputed the emphasis on the job losses occurring \\\"under Obama.\\\" \\\"Presidents get too much credit or blame for changes in the business cycle. Contrary to what seems to be popular opinion, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Obama had or have the unilateral ability to steer the country into good or bad job markets. Neither would a President Romney,\\\" Times economics writer Catherine Rampell wrote in the Economix blog. We\u2019ll conclude with this point: Experts agree that the economic recovery has not helped women as much as men. Howard Wall, an economics professor at Lindenwood University, said it\u2019s fair to fault Obama for that. \\\"I think you have to kind of divide the timeline. Call it the Bush recession and the Obama recovery,\\\" Wall said. \\\"I don\u2019t give them (the Obama administration) credit for stopping the fall or causing the fall. They had nothing to do with that. But they own the recovery.\\\" Does all this mean that Obama\u2019s policies have brought hard times to women? Said Bartlett, the conservative: \\\"There\u2019s no reason to think so.\\\" Evaluate the following assertion: Women account for 92.3 percent of the jobs lost under Obama.

UPDATE, Feb. 29, 2016: After we published this story, a reader pointed us to a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col. Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents \\\"were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins.\\\" In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T. Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: \\\"Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: This is an interesting case study in politics. Let's start by stating the obvious. Rubio would have been better off selling his house to someone other than the mother of a chiropractor who was trying to get him to extend personal injury protection. It seems odd. But, other than perception, there are no obvious glaring red flags about the sale. He got a good price, it seems, but not an outrageous one based on the comparable sales we examined. Also, the cash sale doesn't bother us particularly. This is a retiree who had money from a life insurance policy. As for Rubio's position on the PIP laws, he initially said he would let the mandate expire unless fraud reforms were included. Some were included in the legislation proposed by the Senate, but apparently not enough to sway Rubio. So the session ended in May 2007 without action, despite the house sale. Rubio and House leaders then worked to include additional fraud protections and were able to reach a deal more to their liking. Rubio, in fact, called to include PIP legislation during a special session. The ultimate bill that passed included a few more anti-fraud measures, but seems not to have stopped much fraud, according to state statistics. We're not sure why it took five extra months to include the minor changes to the PIP legislation, or why House leaders didn't propose the changes during the session. Crist condensed the facts when he said that the chiropractor lobbying Rubio bought the house. It was the chiropractor's mother who made the purchase. He also condensed the timeline and slightly manipulated the chain of events when he said, \\\"once he sold the home ... the speaker's position on the issue changed.\\\" We think there's at least a debate on whether he changed his position at all. Rubio never said he opposed extending PIP. He said he opposed extending it without proper protections against fraud. A version of the bill proposed during a 2007 special legislative session emerged that included fraud protections he wanted. Evaluate the following assertion: Says Marco Rubio sold a home to a chiropractor who had been lobbying him on automobile insurance legislation and once he sold the home, for $380,000 cash, the speakers position on the issue changed.

If it\u2019s passed there, it will be enacted on 1 December 2017.The bill would prohibit certain health insurance plans from covering abortions, but would allow women to purchase private supplementary insurance plans that would cover abortions. The bill applies to plans purchased through the Texas health benefit exchange that was set up by the Affordable Care Act, public employee health plans, and several other kinds of insurance.It allows an exception for medically urgent abortions (those deemed necessary to prevent a woman\u2019s death or serious physical injury) but does not allow an exception for the termination of a pregnancy that arises from rape or incest or abortions where a fetal abnormality has been diagnosed.\u00a0There are also certain exceptions of a more technical nature.The Texas House Research Office (HRO) published an\u00a0analysis of the bill:The absence of an exception for rape and incest has proven to be the most controversial element of the bill. The HRO analysis articulates opponents\u2019 rationale as follows:The Groopspeak article\u2019s headline is misleading \u2014 women would not be required to purchase additional insurance. However, abortions would no longer be covered in health insurance plans that are part of the Texas Obamacare exchange, meaning that women  be forced to purchase supplementary plans if they wanted to be insured for abortions.Secondly, the phrase \u201crape insurance\u201d has only been used by the bill\u2019s opponents as part of their opposition to the bill. While it\u2019s true that women would have to purchase additional insurance to cover abortion in the case of rape, they would also have to purchase additional insurance in order to cover the cost of an abortion for almost\u00a0any reason, including incest or a fetal abnormality.\u00a0A more comprehensive and neutral description of this supplementary insurance would therefore be \u201cabortion insurance,\u201d remembering that the bill still allows across-the-board coverage for terminations deemed medically urgent. \u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: In August 2017, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill that would force women to purchase \"rape insurance.\" If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

We can say, however, based on actual facts and figures shared by FEMA and the Department of Defense (DoD), that the stated numbers range from inflated to downright fictional.\u00a0 Based on United States Department of Defense statements, dozens of helicopters have been deployed to Puerto Rico, though the actual number is far less than 140.On 27 September (the same day the meme began circulating), DoD announced an \u201cacceleration\u201d of Puerto Rico relief efforts including the deployment of the amphibious assault ship , whose complement of rotary-wing aircraft would bring the total number of helicopters in use there to 52.\u00a0 By our count, using figures released by the DoD and U.S. Coast Guard, the total number of U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships deployed to Puerto Rico is 18 (though an unknown number of non-military ships are also in use).Counting the , a 1,000 bed hospital ship scheduled to dock in the disaster zone on 4 October, the arrival of the will bring the total number of U.S. Navy ships deployed to five (including the \u00a0and, both conducting search and rescue flights, aerial damage assessments, logistics support and route clearance on and around the island, and the , tasked with delivering 1.1 million meals and one million liters of water). According to the U.S. Coast Guard, 13 of its cutters have been performing search and rescue missions and delivering supplies. An unspecified number of commercial ships are also participating in the aid effort.Emergency medical services are being provided not by Army field hospitals, but by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) personnel assigned to support the efforts of doctors at fully or partially functional hospitals around Puerto Rico, as well as five \u201cfederal medical stations\u201d set up near those facilities.\u00a0\u00a0According to press reports there are Seabees and members of the Army Corps of Engineers now on the ground in Puerto Rico, but we\u2019ve seen no announcements supporting the numbers specified above.Although DoD officials have not released a breakdown of the various military forces thus far deployed to Puerto Rico, Gov. Ricardo Rossello said there were roughly\u00a07,200 U.S. military personnel on the ground as of 2 October, according to a DoD press release, in addition to an estimated 3,000 non-military federal employees, for a total of more than 10,000 government workers involved in relief efforts.\u00a0It is not the case that two nuclear submarines were sent to provide emergency electricity to Puerto Ricans.A reported 95 percent of the island\u2019s 3.4 million inhabitants were still without power as of 2 October, according to local officials. FEMA reported distributing and setting up more than 300 emergency generators since the disaster, but most of that effort was devoted to restoring power to hospitals and other critical facilities.Using nuclear submarines to supply emergency power in disaster areas has been proposed, but never tried. In 1982, the USS Indianapolis was deployed to Kauai, Hawaii in the aftermath of Hurricane Iwa, a solution both Navy and civilian officials said would have been technically feasible, though the plan was ultimately abandoned in favor of using a portable generator to \u201cjump start\u201d the island\u2019s main power plant. No such \u201cnuclear option\u201d has been proposed in the case of Puerto Rico.\u00a0We have not found the above (or any) overall total tonnage stated in any official sources, but vast amounts of food and supplies have either arrived or are on their way to Puerto Rico. According to FEMA, more than two million meals and 2.5 million litres of water have reached the island and been distributed, plus medical equipment, generators, gasoline, and other supplies, with more coming.For more information, see FEMA\u2019s daily-updated overview\u00a0of federal government efforts on behalf of the citizens of Puerto Rico.

Many social media users heard about an eerie warning\u00a0spread by a visibly agitated woman nearly an hour prior to the massacre, but far fewer saw that the witness to that purported prediction later walked her claims back significantly.No. The concept of a \u201csecond shooter\u201d became embedded in American consciousness after the first conspiracy rumors circulated about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. A meme that appeared after this particular mass shooting highlights purported \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in the \u201cnarrative\u201d of the incident, but it does not vary much from the other conspiracy theories that come up after every such incident:Similar rumors take root in the wake of nearly all mass shootings, but neither investigators nor any evidence has indicated that anyone other than\u00a0Stephen Paddock fired into the crowd at the concert.Yes.\u00a0CBS attorney Hayley Geftman-Gold was relieved of her duties after a controversy after post-shooting remarks attributed to her were captured and publicized by a blog.A status update was widely shared as a \u201csilver lining\u201d after the massacre:Its veracity remains unclear at this time.On 3 October 2017, a Facebook post appeared featuring purportedly leaked crime scene photographs of the Mandalay Bay room from which the shots were fired:The authenticity of the photographs is unknown, and it is not clear whether they were leaked (versus being taken by a bystander or obtained in a fashion other than surreptitious distribution).Another claim common in circulation after the Las Vegas massacre was that mass shooters are affected by psychotropic drugs such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, or anti-psychotic medications:On 3 October 2017, Facebook user Rikki Raulerson shared the following Facebook status update, the contents of which are unverified:Although this rumor is a variation on the \u201csecond shooter\u201d claim, it also fails to take into account the difficulties faced by eyewitnesses in identifying the specifics of the shooting as it happened.Due to the close proximity most Vegas casinos share (many are connected to neighboring venues) and the acoustics of the Strip, a barrage of gunfire from one location could easily be mistaken for one from somewhere nearby.\u00a0Unproven. The post in question was nebulous, and still managed to inaccurately describe the subsequent attack. Although the general location (the Las Vegas strip) fit the prognostication, no other elements were compelling enough to consider the claim credible.\u00a0No. Although the meme\u2019s origin was unknown, it was one of many satirizing Bachmann\u2019s positions.\u00a0No. A disreputable source claimed that\u00a0Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos was an \u201caccomplice\u201d to Las Vegas Strip mass shooter Stephen Paddock, but\u00a0the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) put paid to the phony story with alacrity.For the most part, no. Conspiracies swirled arround a Las Vegas Craigslist ad archived on 17 August 2017; date stamps suggest it was published on or around 3 August 2017:On 6 October 2017, Puppet String News claimed:WorldTruth.tv asserted the same day (in a post riddled with typographical errors) that the suspicious advertisement had conveniently been deleted after the Las Vegas shooting:However, all Craigslist posts expire automatically after 30 to 45 days. Even going by the latest date the post was archived (19 August 2017) and not the likely date it was posted (3 August 2017), 49 days passed between the date of the post and 6 October 2017 and two months between the posting date and the 1 October 2017 shooting.Moreover, anti-semitic conspiracy theorists previously set their sights on the same posting \u2014 as part of predictions that bad actors planned chaos for the then-recent Mayweather/McGregor bout. Another post in a general conspiracy forum warned:Even after Vegas shooting conspiracies had begun circulating, forum posters recalled the post as linked to the boxing match. Although there was some confusion, posters for the most part correctly identified the Craigslist post as dated to early August 2017. The advertisement was legitimate, but it was retrofitted to align with false flag theories about the Vegas shooting and its original connotations (fizzled predictions about a \u201crace war\u201d at a boxing match) were elided in the retelling.

The post, which was subsequently deleted from the Facebook page of photography company\u00a0Endres Photography, described the testimony of a client named Brianna, who asserted that this life-altering event was caused by her husband\u2019s excess consumption of energy drinks:Fox News was among the sites that picked up Brianna\u2019s click-friendly story, but no one reporting on the topic appeared to look further than her Facebook post to verify whether the details were accurate or correct. Dates, locations, and other information necessary to verify her husband Austin\u2019s purported diagnosis were missing from news accounts; instead, those reports incorporated quotes and screenshots from a single secondhand Facebook post. Articles on the subject did not even include statements from doctors verifying that the information presented was credible or medically plausible.We reached out to three medical experts to assess the plausibility of the scenario described by\u00a0Endres Photography but had not received a response by press time. A search of medical literature suggests that a hemorrhage caused by an energy drink is plausible but unlikely, and, if a connection between the two were present at all, it would be poorly understood.The primary link, if there is one, would likely come from caffeine\u2019s effect on blood pressure. Caffeine, by constricting blood vessels, increases a person\u2019s blood pressure, which can ultimately increase the risk of hemorrhaging in the brain. A number of analyses have reached conflicting conclusions about the reality of this scenario, however.A 2016 paper purports to present the first case report in medical literature suggesting a connection between energy drinks and brain hemorrhaging. That single report, concerning a 57-year-old who consumed an energy drink called Redline, does not provide much outside of speculation, however:Based on Brianna\u2019s account, the doctors in her case \u201cconcluded\u201d the cause of her husband\u2019s brain hemorrhage was his (admittedly considerable) energy drink habit, based only on the fact that no other drugs were found in his system. Without knowing what additional information was available to the doctors, it is impossible to say whether or not this conclusion was, similarly, speculative on their part.Regardless of the specific cause of brain hemorrhaging, removing a portion of the victim\u2019s skull (a procedure known as a\u00a0decompressive hemicraniectomy) is sometimes indicated as a treatment for some kinds of such hemorrhages. It is therefore possible that such a surgery, the aftermath of which might be depicted in these photographs, would be performed on someone with excessive bleeding in the brain.However, in the lack of additional information we cannot know if doctors did indeed diagnose a man named Austin with a brain hemorrhage, if they attributed the hemorrhage to an energy drink, and if they were correct in doing so. If events did indeed occur this way, they would be \u2014 based on the scientific literature \u2014 extremely rare. Evaluate the following assertion: Energy drinks caused an expectant father to lose a large portion of his skull.

People convicted of felonies who are on state or federal parole or imprisoned in a state or federal prison are still barred from voting in California.Previously, anyone in prison or on parole for a felony in California was barred from registering to vote or casting their ballot. The law came into effect on 1 January 2017.The measure stems from a 2011 reform in California, where \u201clow-level\u201d (mainly non-violent) felons began to be imprisoned in county jails so as to ease overcrowding in state and federal prisons. \u00a0The law\u2019s sponsor, Democratic Assembly member Shirley Weber, said the measure was aimed at rehabilitating and reintegrating convicted felons into society,   reported:The bill was opposed by Republican Assembly members, along with the California State Sheriffs\u2019 Association and California Police Chiefs Association, according to .\u00a0In the fall of 2017, the California non-profit organization Initiate Justice began a campaign to amend the state\u2019s constitution to further extend voting rights to individuals on state or federal parole or in a state prison for a felony conviction.As it stands, Article 2 Section 4 of the California Constitution bars anyone who is deemed \u201cmentally incompetent\u00a0or imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony\u201d from voting (AB 2466 circumvented this by redefining \u201cimprisoned or on parole\u201d to only include state or federal institutions). Before a ballot measure in 1976, the constitution barred anyone who had ever been convicted of a felony from voting, even after the completion of their sentence.As of October 2017, Initiate Justice was preparing to gather the 585,407 signatures required to get the proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot at the November 2018 elections. If the proposal is passed by the voters of California, it could pave the way for a new bill proposed by the group \u2013 the Voting Restoration and Democracy Act of 2018, which would prohibit the stripping of voting rights from anyone imprisoned or on parole for a felony.\u00a0So Brown has signed a law to allow felons in county jails to vote \u2013 a significant reform of California\u2019s electoral law, but one that still leaves a large cohort of felons (those in state or federal prisons) unable to vote while behind bars.\u00a0Nationwide, only two states \u2013 Maine and Vermont \u2013 allow all individuals to vote regardless of whether they are serving a sentence for a felony, and regardless of the type of prison they\u2019re in, according to research by the National Conference of State Legislatures.\u00a0In 14 states and the District of Columbia, convicted felons automatically have their voting rights restored as soon as their period of incarceration ends, and most states allow felons to vote once their sentence is completed (that is, including parole and probation.)In nine states, action is required by the governor or a court to restore a convicted felon\u2019s right to vote, even after they complete their sentence.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law allowing convicted felons to vote while still in prison.

There\u2019s no credible information to support the claim that any of these groups were involved in the train derailment. Hours after the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that when Train 501 left the tracks, it was going 80 miles per hour in a 30-mile-per-hour zone\u00a0during its inaugural run on the new route between Seattle and Portland, Oregon. Investigators have found no evidence that vandalized tracks were the cause of the accident.In a phone interview, Cernovich pushed back against the criticism that he had spread unverified information to his hundreds of thousands of followers, telling us that he had made it clear that the theory was mere\u00a0speculation:Cernovich acknowledged his large following gives his words a long reach:A source from It\u2019s Going Down who provided only the name \u201cJames A.\u201d told us that \u201cPuget Sound Anarchists\u201d had sent in the April post after receiving it from another group.

If it was, it wouldn\u2019t have been the first vandalism of its type.

On page 302 of , Wolff reports the following (based, judging from the context, on information given him by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon):That Trump and McConnell were on the outs in August 2017 is easily confirmed by looking back at press coverage\u00a0of the time, not to mention President Trump\u2019s own tweets disparaging McConnell\u2019s leadership:\nFor his part, McConnell loosed barbs aimed at Trump\u2019s inexperience in government. \u201cOur new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before,\u201d he said on 7 August. \u201cI think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.\u201dBut, unlike Wolff, even though they had heard about the majority leader\u2019s haircut rebuke, journalists covering the so-called Trump/McConnell \u201cfeud\u201d shied away from reporting\u00a0it because it couldn\u2019t be authenticated\u00a0\u2014 as noted in this post- tweet by\u00a0 reporter Ashley Parker:\nAxios political reporter Jonathan Swan was among those who couldn\u2019t find a source to corroborate the story:\nReading between the lines, the source Swan referred to was presumably Steve Bannon, whose interest (at the time) was defending President Trump.

Although Albert Einstein didn\u2019t actually develop the atom bomb, his work did make such a device possible:His work was so entwined with the development of nuclear weapons that\u00a0featured a picture of Einstein on their July 1946 cover, in front of an explosion with the equation \u201cE=mc\u00b2\u201d written in the mushroom cloud:Einstein was, in other words, well aware of how nuclear weapons could affect the world.\u00a0 However, although he did repeatedly warn the world about the dangers of nuclear weapons, this quote doesn\u2019t appear to be an exact record of the physicist\u2019s words and even the earliest records appear to be anecdotal.\u00a0In March 1947,\u00a0reports appeared about an exchange that Einstein reportedly had with a group of friends at a dinner party:exchange.\u00a0Even if Einstein expressed this exact sentiment, he was not the first to do so. In September 1946, more than six months before the quote was first attributed to Einstein, a reporter attributed this\u00a0quip\u00a0to an unnamed Army lieutenant:Einstein may have been paraphrasing something he had heard earlier during his interview with Werner\u00a0\u2014 or this may simply be an anecdote relaying the physicist\u2019s attitude toward nuclear weapons. Einstein was, after all, a signatory on the Russel-Einstein Manifesto, which warned about the potentially world-altering devastation of nuclear weaponry:We found several other instances of people making similar statements at around the same time, indicating that this was a popular opinion at that time that was evidently shared by Albert Einstein.

A young man living in a French farming village in the 1950s undergoes an extraordinary growth spurt and becomes too ungainly to ride the bus to school. A neighbor with a convertible automobile steps in to help. The adult and the young man strike up an unlikely friendship on their morning car journeys, discussing the game of cricket and other subjects as they form a special bond with each other.The older man with the car? He was Samuel Beckett, the Irish playwright and author of , who would go on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969. The boy? Andr\u00e9 Roussimoff, who would eventually grow to a height of more than seven feet and become famous as Andr\u00e9 the Giant, a global superstar and icon in the world professional wrestling.It\u2019s one of pop culture\u2019s most bizarre and cherished \u201cchance encounter\u201d tales. But is it true?The story, in its rudiments, has been around for years, but it has most prominently been told by Cary Elwes, the English actor who played Westley in the 1987 film  and became close with Andr\u00e9 (who played Fezzik) during the production of that movie.In his voiceover commentary to accompany behind-the-scenes footage of  released as a DVD extra in 2000, Elwes told the Samuel Beckett story as follows:Elwes recounted the story in greater detail in his 2014 memoir :The odd friendship between the two has captured the imagination for years and has inspired fictionalized portrayals in works such as a graphic novel, short film and two plays.The story is plausible on its face. Beckett did live near the Roussimoffs in Molien, a tiny hamlet in the town of Ussy-sur-Marne near Paris, from 1953 to 1960, when Andr\u00e9 was between the ages of seven and 14.\u00a0According to an essay by the leading Beckett expert James Knowlson, at that time the Irishman did drive a Citr\u00f6en 2CV, which was a convertible. Beckett was also a great fan of cricket, once a serious player himself.However, the April 2018 release of a documentary feature film about the wrestler, who died in 1993, brought the legend under renewed scrutiny.Jason Hehir, the director of , was asked about the Beckett story in interviews surrounding the release of the film on HBO, telling  that the tale as commonly related was somewhat exaggerated:We got in touch with Hehir, who sent us an excerpt from the transcript of his interview with Antoine Roussimoff, a brother of Andr\u00e9. Roussimoff said Beckett, along with other local adults, sometimes gave car rides to schoolchildren, but not exclusively to Andr\u00e9, and not because he had outgrown the school bus. \u201cThere was no bus,\u201d Antoine told the filmmakers:Roussimoff also put paid to the legend that his father had helped build Beckett\u2019s house for him, saying: \u201cWe had nothing to do with Mr. Beckett. Absolutely nothing. My parents, they knew him when they would run into each other, that\u2019s all.\u201dSimilarly, Roussimoff dismissed a separate story that Andr\u00e9 was forced to leave school later in his teenage years because he could no longer be accommodated in the schoolhouse, such was his size:In an email, Hehir told us that Andr\u00e9\u2019s other brother and one of Andr\u00e9\u2019s childhood friends had both corroborated the version of events provided by Antoine Roussimoff, adding: Evaluate the following assertion: Samuel Beckett used to drive a teenaged Andr\u00e9 the Giant to school when they lived in a small French village.

A portion of the law pertained to classifications of the flammability of clothing, including baseline standards for general flammability in garments.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In June 2018, as the controversy surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policy that led to more than 2,000 undocumented migrant children being separated from their parents grew to a fever pitch, a photograph of a sobbing, 2-year-old Honduran refugee came to stand, in the minds of many, for everything that was wrong with that policy.In the minds of others, however, it came to represent bias and dishonesty in the media, for although it wasn\u2019t clear at the outset whether the girl had actually been separated from her mother (it was eventually determined that she was not), the image was widely used to illustrate press coverage of the policy and dominated the news cycle for days.White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders condemned the image\u2019s use in a 22 June tweet:The Daily Wire, among other pro-Trump web sites, objected that media organizations who published the image were attempting to score political points under false pretenses:And even the mainstream  ran an opinion piece critical of what the author termed the \u201cmisleading\u201d use of the image:But while the implication that the child was separated from a parent was widespread, to call it misleading is to suggest that the outlets who ran the image knew all along that no such separation took place. Moreover, whether the girl was ultimately taken from her mother or not, the photograph documents a real instance of the enforcement of the zero-tolerance policy that could have led to separation. And although it was contextualized in terms of family separation from its earliest public iteration, the number of times news media organizations explicitly claimed that the photograph depicted a child being taken from her parent can be counted on one hand.The picture was snapped on 12 June 2018 by Getty Images photographer John Moore near McAllen, Texas, during a ride-along with Border Patrol agents as they took asylum seekers from Central America into custody. Moore posted the picture the next day on his personal Instagram page with commentary noting that the administration\u2019s zero-tolerance policy meant that children would be separated from their parents in detention:The image went mainstream two days later (on 14 June) atop a GettyImages.com feature highlighting Moore\u2019s photographs of what was termed \u201csoon-to-be-separated migrant families\u201d under the title \u201cWhen the Government Takes Your Children.\u201d The text didn\u2019t indicate what ultimately happened to the girl and her mother, although Moore was quoted as saying he last saw them entering a transport van together. (The headline of the article was subsequently changed to \u201cThe Face of Zero Tolerance,\u201d and the phrase \u201csoon-to-be-separated\u201d was deleted. An editor\u2019s note said the article was updated \u201cto reflect new information regarding the government\u2019s policy as well as the families in these photos.\u201d)The image began turning up in national and regional news publications that same day. Among the first to use the image was the , which ran it in a 14 June story about immigrant detention centers above a boilerplate caption (presumably supplied by Getty) that would accompany the photograph in dozens more venues in the several days that followed, including the , ,  magazine, , and the web site of National Public Radio.The caption did not say that mother and daughter had been separated, but rather that they faced \u201cpossible separation\u201d at a U.S. Border Patrol processing center:Other venues, while they did use the photograph to illustrate articles about family separation, made no specific claims about what it did or did not depict (these included the , the , ABC News, the , and ).Still other outlets went the opposite way, stating more than they knew. On 18 June, in a  article quoting John Moore on his feelings about taking the photograph, the author described it as depicting \u201can asylum-seeking young girl crying at a detention center as Border Patrol agents questioned her mother before separating them.\u201dOn 19 June, the New York   featured the image in an article headlined \u201cPhotographer Describes Harrowing New Images Showing 2-Year-Old Girl Bawling as She\u2019s Separated from Mother at U.S. Border.\u201dAnd, on 21 June, in a story recounting the genesis of what was undoubtedly the most controversial use of Moore\u2019s photograph \u2014 a  magazine cover juxtaposing the image of the diminutive migrant girl with that of a towering Donald Trump \u2014 the  described the subject matter of the original as \u201ca young girl crying as her mother was patted down by a Border Patrol agent before the two were separated.\u201dCompounding the \u2018s error was the fact that the  (which itself had previously run a story describing the photograph as showing a \u201ccrying two-year-old asylum seeker being separated from her mom\u201d) published an interview with the girl\u2019s father that same day in which he denied that the mother and daughter were ever separated. Reuters followed up with their own interview with the father, Denis Valera, who said, again, that the two had been detained together, not separately. Honduras deputy foreign minister Nelly Jerez confirmed Valera\u2019s claims.The  corrected their article as follows:The  article referenced in the correction was published on 19 June. The magazine had issued a correction as well:By the time the truth about the image was sorted out, President Trump had signed an executive order calling a halt to family separations (though not to the underlying zero-tolerance policy that led to the separations). In addition to covering Trump\u2019s order and its implications for immigrant families, many of the news organizations that had previously run the photograph published reports setting the record straight about its content.It would be difficult to make the case that John Moore\u2019s gripping image did not play a crucial role in causing a reversal of the family separation policy. But it\u2019s just as difficult to make the case that its emotional impact derived from a misrepresentation of its content. As \u2018s editor-in-chief, Edward Felsenthal, told CNN, \u201cNone of us in the media who used the photo knew what had happened to the girl after this precise moment. And I actually think part of the power of the image is that unknown.\u201dIn an official statement, Felsenthal added: Evaluate the following assertion: News media outlets misrepresented a photograph of a two-year-old migrant girl whose mother was arrested at the U.S-Mexico border as depicting an instance of family separation.

The requirement that a Supreme Court nominee be confirmed by a vote of the U.S. Senate often touches off bitter fights between the two parties on the floor of that chamber.When Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his imminent retirement at the end of June 2018, it set the stage for a particularly momentous shift in the makeup of the Supreme Court, as Kennedy had long been the bridge between the court\u2019s liberal and conservative sides on a number of contentious social issues: Many critics still smarting over the Republicans\u2019 successful (and unprecedented) efforts at blocking approval of Merrick Garland, who had been nominated by outgoing president Barack Obama in 2016 after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia \u2014 thus allowing incoming president Donald Trump the opportunity to fill the vacant court seat instead \u2014 immediately jumped on a conspiracy theory involving the timing of Kennedy\u2019s resignation and his son\u2019s employment:The details of this conspiracy theory were somewhat hazy, most versions of it seemingly implying that President Trump somehow leveraged his financial connections with Kennedy\u2019s son Justin to convince or coerce the jurist to retire ahead of the November 2018 U.S. mid-term elections (during which Democrats might pick up enough Senate seats to block confirmation of Trump\u2019s preferred nominee).  The most coherent form of the conspiracy theory posited that Kennedy\u2019s retirement was a sudden and unexpected event, a strategic move intended to allow Trump to nominate a friendly successor who would vote favorably on any issues involving Justin Kennedy that might come before the court as a result of the ongoing Mueller investigation into Russian election interference (whereas Kennedy would have to recuse himself from such issues if he remained on the bench):As the  noted, Donald Trump did have a business relationship with Deutsche Bank, where Justin Kennedy once worked (he left the company in 2009), that went back many years to a time when many other banks were leery of doing business with Trump:And, of course, many news outlets have reported on the potentially suspect coincidence that right about the time Trump was sworn in as U.S. president, Deutsche Bank was fined an aggregate $630 million for their involvement in a $10 billion Russian money-laundering scheme \u2014 and Deutsche Bank\u2019s records were later reportedly subpoenaed by special prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections:Little hard evidence suggests that the Kennedy rumors are more than political conspiracy-driven speculation, however.  Justin Kennedy left Deutsche Bank before the money laundering activity referenced above took place, and some sources have asserted that Justin Kennedy had little or no involvement with Trump\u2019s Deutsche Bank dealings:The level of engagement Justin Kennedy might have had with Donald Trump\u2019s financial dealings at Deutsche Bank remains ambiguous for now, but the  gave little weight to the notion that Anthony Kennedy was directly pressured into retiring, observing that it\u2019s not unusual for presidents to be mindful of when an open seat on the Supreme Court bench might be in the offing and strategize around the possibility:Moreover,  reported back in April 2017 (before the Mueller investigation into Russian interference was even underway) that the Trump White House might have been utilizing connections between Trump\u2019s and Kennedy\u2019s children to ease the elder Kennedy into retirement.  Notably,  referenced Justin Kennedy\u2019s having a connection with Donald Trump, Jr., not President Trump himself, and made no mention of Deutsche Bank:It may be true, as outlined above, that members of the Trump administration undertook efforts to \u201cassure Kennedy that his judicial legacy would be in good hands should he step down at the end of the court\u2019s [current] term.\u201d But no substantive evidence yet suggests anything more than that President Trump and other members of his administration might have sought to curry favor with a justice who was already mulling retirement to influence the timing of that event. Evaluate the following assertion: Justice Anthony Kennedy suddenly resigned from the Supreme Court as part of a deal to shield his son from ongoing Russian investigations.

According to city documents, the new law authorizes \u201cSan Francisco residents who are not United States citizens but who are the parents, legal guardians, or caregivers of a child residing in San Francisco to vote in elections for the Board of Education.\u201d  Registrants must be at least 18 at the time of the next election, reside in the city of San Francisco, and be parents or caregivers with legal custody of children who also live in San Francisco.The term \u201cnon-citizen\u201d is a broad one that encompasses everyone from lawful permanent U.S. residents (i.e., \u201cgreen card\u201d holders) who have lived in the United States for many years, to undocumented immigrants lacking a legal basis for prolonged residency in the U.S.   Non-citizens are barred by federal law from voting in federal elections, but the choice of whether to allow non-citizens to vote at state or local levels is up to individual state and municipal legislatures. Takoma Park, Maryland for example, has allowed non-citizen residents to vote in City Council elections since 1992.Eugene Lau, communications manager for the San Francisco immigrant advocacy group Chinese for Affirmative Action, told us of the new law that:Non-citizen voting affidavits will carry alerts in multiple languages cautioning potential non-citizen voters that information they provide to the San Francisco Department of Elections may be obtained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and advising prospective registrants that they \u201cmay wish\u201d to contact an attorney or knowledgeable immigration advocate before registering. San Francisco is a sanctuary city, meaning that city employees are prohibited from assisting federal immigration authorities unless required by law to do so. Evaluate the following assertion: San Francisco is registering \"illegal aliens\" to vote.

What it lacks, obviously, is context.The minimum wage is a\u00a0perennial topic of debate in American politics. Although public opinion polls indicate general bipartisan support for minimum wage increases perceived as reasonable, partisan disagreement remains not only over what constitutes a reasonable minimum wage level, but over who should set it (local, state, or federal governments), and whether or not it should even exist.Proponents say a minimum wage is necessary to ensure livable earnings for workers with the least bargaining power. A minimum wage that is at least indexed to inflation, they argue,\u00a0reduces wage inequality, as well as injecting money into the economy and creating jobs by increasing consumer spending. Opponents argue that a too-high minimum wage hurts businesses and increases unemployment by forcing employers to lay off workers they can\u2019t afford. It also shuts younger and unskilled workers out of the workforce, they claim, because employers are unwilling to pay them higher wages.As of 2017, the U.S. federal minimum wage\u00a0stood at $7.25 an hour, an amount that hadn\u2019t budged in eight years despite increases in the cost of living. For that reason, at least 29 states (including Missouri) had established state-wide minimum wages above the federal floor. Individual cities and counties took action as well, in many cases adopting local ordinances that raised minimum wages even higher than those set by their states.One place this latter action occurred was St. Louis, Missouri, where city officials decided in 2015 that the minimum hourly wage needed\u00a0to be raised to $10 ($2.30 above than the state-mandated minimum of $7.70), with another increase (to $11) set to go into effect in 2018.The ordinance, which did not apply to small businesses employing fewer than 15 workers or grossing less than $500,000 a year, was intended to raise the standard of living for the lowest wage earners in a city where the poverty rate was twice the national average, according to a report in the :Though its implementation was delayed for two years because of legal challenges by business groups, St. Louis\u2019s $10 wage floor finally took effect in May 2017, instantly adding an average of $200 a month to the incomes of tens of thousands of workers.\u00a0Missouri governor Eric Greitens, a Republican, had been opposed to the increase all along, arguing that it would \u201ckill jobs\u201d and \u201ctake money out of people\u2019s pockets.\u201d A Republican lawmaker, Jason Chipman, introduced a bill\u00a0(HB 1194) that would pre-empt local minimum wage laws everywhere in the state. Days after the St. Louis ordinance went into effect, the Republican-dominated Missouri legislature passed the pre-emption bill in a party line vote, effectively overriding the local ordinance. When the bill became law at the end of August,\u00a0 St. Louis\u2019s minimum wage reverted to $7.70, the same as the state\u2019s.Some disagreement remains over how many workers were actually affected by the changes in St. Louis\u2019s minimum wage. The meme cited a number (35,000 workers) taken from the , which attributed the estimate to the non-profit\u00a0National Employment Law Project (NELP).\u00a0\u00a0However, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis came up with a different estimate based on a distinction between resident and non-resident minimum-wage workers. Observing that \u201conly one-third of the workers in St. Louis City are city residents, and less than half of the city workers earning less than $10 per hour are residents,\u201d the researchers calculated that approximately 20,000 St. Louis residents saw an impact on their earnings. Including non-residents, they estimated that around 32,500 workers were affected, a slightly lower number than that estimated by NELP.On 1 January 2018, Missouri increased their statewide minimum wage by 15 cents, to $7.85 per hour. In May, a ballot initiative was proposed to raise the minimum wage to $8.60 in 2019 and an additional 85 cents per year thereafter, until it reaches $12 by 2023. Evaluate the following assertion: Missouri Republicans passed a bill to lower the minimum wage in St. Louis from $10 an hour to $7.70.

The move brought significant scrutiny, including claims that clothing had been excluded from the list of taxed products in order to benefit the president\u2019s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump, whose clothing line has in the past sold products manufactured in China. (A few months later, Ivanka Trump said she would be closing down her clothing company.)In July 2018, various news accounts reported that in anticipation of the implementation of those tariffs, customers in the United States and elsewhere were ramping up their orders for one Chinese-made product in particular: President Trump re-election campaign items.The reports gave rise to speculation that not only was the president\u2019s re-election campaign itself ordering campaign items produced in China rather than in the U.S., but that they were attempting to mitigate against the increased costs that would come with the tariffs by pushing for the quick completion of those materials \u2014 moves that would provide a double dose of irony for a politician who has famously emphasized prioritizing American jobs and manufacturing.Some news reports contained ambiguous phrasing which created the impression (without explicitly stating such) that the Trump campaign had ordered the production of Chinese-made campaign flags. For example, the  described materials being manufactured in Chinese factories as \u201cTrump\u2019s re-election banners,\u201d while  called them \u201cTrump\u2019s 2020 banners.\u201d  magazine similarly described the merchandise as \u201cTrump\u2019s 2020 re-election flags,\u201d while adding a disclaimer about the identity of the customer who actually ordered them: \u201cWhile it is not confirmed that Trump\u2019s campaign ordered the flags, who else besides Sean Spicer is really that hype about the dude?\u201dOn 27 July, Vermont senator and 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was more direct and explicit in accusing both the president himself and his campaign of having ordered the Chinese-made banners and flags. In a Facebook post, Sanders described the items as \u201cflags for President Trump\u2019s campaign\u201d and accused the president of \u2018opting for\u2019 cheap foreign labor:In a 3 July 2018 interview with National Public Radio (NPR), Li Jiang, a factory owner in China\u2019s Zhejiang province, said that \u201cWe also make flags for Trump for 2020,\u201d but this comment was ambiguous about whether the merchandise was ordered by the Trump campaign itself.On 19 July 2018, the state-run Chinese newspaper the  quoted the owners of two more factories in Zhejiang as saying that in recent months they had faced an increased volume of orders for flags bearing the campaign slogans \u201cTrump 2020\u201d and \u201cKeep America Great.\u201dBoth the Reuters and Agence France-Presse\u00a0(AFP) news agencies reported on a fourth factory, this one in China\u2019s Anhui province, which had been pumping out Trump 2020 flags and banners at a higher rate than usual, with Reuters quoting a factory manager as stating that her \u201cbuyers are located in both China and abroad\u201d and that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t know if they are affiliated with Trump\u2019s official campaign or the Republican Party\u201d:Both Reuters and AFP included clear photographic and video evidence in their reports, so it\u2019s clear that Trump 2020 merchandise ordered by  was being produced in at least one Chinese factory as of July 2018:None of the Chinese factory owners and managers quoted in the July 2018 news reports either affirmed or denied that the Trump campaign itself had been responsible for the significant increase in orders in recent months, and none of them identified anyone else as being a major customer, so we do not know who was behind orders for the many thousands of \u201cTrump 2020\u201d flags produced in China in the first half of 2018.A Trump campaign spokesperson firmly rejected any speculation or allegations linking the campaign to the merchandise.\u00a0In a statement sent to us by the Trump 2020 campaign, Michael Glassner, Chief Operating Officer of the Donald J. Trump for President committee, wrote:We searched Federal Election Commission records on spending by three Trump-related political committees since 2017 and found no evidence of flags, banners, or other campaign merchandise being ordered from entities based in China. If such orders had been placed, it is possible that they may have been recorded as disbursements to third parties or subcontractors, but we found no evidence that this had taken place.It\u2019s clear that Trump 2020 merchandise is being produced in Chinese factories, and it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the future implementation of tariffs on Chinese imports has prompted something of a surge in orders, as recounted by several local factory officials.The volume of the orders (90,000 banners between March and July, at just one factory) is not inconsistent with the activities of a major U.S. presidential election campaign, and it is therefore reasonable to question the identity of the customer(s) behind such orders. However, we\u2019ve so far found no concrete evidence documenting who is responsible for these orders: merchandisers, the Trump campaign itself, Republican partisans, foreign entities, or some combination thereof.  Evaluate the following assertion: The Trump re-election campaign is responsible for a surge in orders of \"Trump 2020\" flags and banners produced in Chinese factories, just before the imposition of U.S. tariffs.

Oysters are famously efficient at cleaning up water, and this fact is commonly demonstrated by comparing oyster filled and non-oyster filled tanks, as was done in the following demonstration from the Florida Oceanographic Society:Oysters are filter feeders who suck water through their gills, trapping particles that are between 1-10 microns in diameter, which is the size of their primary prey: phytoplankton.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, one oyster can indeed \u201cfilter more than 50 gallons of water in 24 hours.\u201dObviously, this material does not simply disappear. Phytoplankton and nutrients contribute to the growth of both the oyster\u2019s body and its shell, while other material is ejected in the form of feces. Even the material an oyster does not keep is still cleared from the water by being compressed into pellets that sink rather than float. These pellets are then deposited on the ocean (or tank) floor, no longer in suspension in the water.While we cannot confirm the original source of the meme, and therefore confirm the specific claims of the experiment it describes, the claim that one oyster can filter more than 50 gallons of water in 24 hours is true, and the photograph appears to be of a common experiment used to illuminate that point.

The largest leatherback ever recorded was just shy of 10 feet long and weighed more than 2,000 pounds (although some debate still exists over the accuracy of these measurements). While it\u2019s difficult to determine the exact dimensions of the turtle featured in the video seen here, it certainly appears that the subject might be a contender for the largest turtle in the world title.However, looks can be deceiving.A second video of this turtle making its way to the ocean that was posted by Facebook user Eric Laurent provided a more clear look at the size of this turtle. Laurent said that his video was taken on a beach called \u201cLes Perles\u201d in Guadeloupe, a French overseas region in the southern Caribbean Sea:We compared the people visible in the background of these videos to confirm that they indeed captured same turtle making a journey to the sea.

Our best guess is that the first video was filmed with a longer lens and at a further distance than the second video. Longer lenses tend to compress depth in photographs, making objects in the background (the crowd of people) appear closer to objects in the foreground (the turtle) than they actually were. In this case, that phenomenon created the impression that turtle was abnormally large.Laurent posted a second video from the same day which presumably showed the same turtle:This viral video truly does show a large leatherback turtle, but it also likely left many viewers with a false impression of the animal\u2019s size.

The militants also stabbed and shot some of their victims.The American couple, Jay Austin and Lauren Geoghegan, had left their jobs in the Washington, D.C. area in order to embark on an extended around-the-world cycling trip which took them to Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.Over the weekend of 28-29 July, they were killed along with two other cyclists from Switzerland and the Netherlands. According to the , Tajik officials announced that security forces had in turn killed four people suspected of having perpetrated that attack.\tOn 15 August, the Pluralist web site published an article that accurately described the details of couple\u2019s trip and their deaths, but the headline they employed, which they later changed\u00a0\u2014 \u201cMillennial Couple Bikes Through ISIS Territory to Prove \u2018Humans Are Kind\u2019 and Gets Killed\u201d \u2014 and other phrasing may have created the impression that the couple\u2019s deaths were infused with irony and served as a kind of allegorical warning about cosmopolitan, liberal naivety:We found no evidence that either Austin or Geoghegan set out on their cycling trip for the purpose of vindicating an existing belief about the overall goodness or kindness of humanity. Based on posts on the couple\u2019s blog, the predominant motivation behind their trip appears to have been no more than a sense of adventure and a desire to experience life in other parts of the world. In one post, for example, they wrote:After leaving his job at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in the summer of 2017, Austin wrote:None of the many blog entries and Instagram posts that the couple published before and during their journey suggested that they set out with the intention of \u201cproving\u201d that humans are good or kind. Furthermore, Austin posted several times from Tajikistan, but none of what he wrote while there indicated that the couple were concerned about or cognizant of any risk of a terrorist attack.This significantly undermines the notion that the couple traveled through \u201cISIS territory to prove \u2018humans are kind'\u201d (i.e. that they were aware of a risk of attack by ISIS and traveled through that particular area specifically to vindicate their views about human kindness).At the time Austin and Geoghegan visited Tajikistan, the U.S. State Department listed the country as a relatively low-risk destination for American travelers, giving it a Level 1 \u201ctravel advisory\u201d (the lowest available) which comes with advice to \u201cexercise normal precautions.\u201dOn the risk posed by terrorism, the State Department web site advised:(Since the fatal attack on Austin and Geoghegan, the State Department has upgraded their Tajikistan travel advisory to Level 2, warning would-be travellers to \u201cexercise increased caution.\u201d)While there is no evidence that the couple set out to prove anything on their trip, it is true is that Austin and Geoghegan appear to have been struck, many times, by the generosity and thoughtfulness of some of the strangers they encountered. In fact, Austin called it a \u201crevelation,\u201d a description that further undermines the idea that this was a fervently-held belief before the trip, which the couple set out to vindicate.Austin and Geoghegan appear to have had both negative and positive experiences along their journey, posting about cold weather, illness, bike trouble, and the occasional collision with unfriendly motorists, but also enthusing about the breathtaking views they encountered, and writing frequently about the kindness of the people around them. After being fed and shown very generous hospitality by one family in Morocco, Austin wrote:Based on their own written reflections posted during their trip, Austin and Geoghegan were not acting as liberal, idealist missionaries, despite the impression that the Pluralist headline might have created. Like many tourists who traveled beyond their own cultural comfort zones, they appeared to have been simply struck by the generosity and thoughtfulness they encountered, just as they took note of moments of hostility or unhelpfulness.

McKee, in Beaufort, South Carolina, in 1839. (Either McKee or McKee\u2019s son may have been Smalls\u2019 father, but this is unconfirmed.) When Smalls was a teenager, his mother asked McKee to allow her son to be rented out for work in Charleston, South Carolina, where he was eventually hired as a deckhand on the coastal cotton transport steamship . In short order, Smalls became the ship\u2019s de facto pilot.According to a biography of Smalls by historian Henry Louis Gates, Jr., \u201cfew knew Charleston harbor better than Robert Smalls,\u201d and this knowledge became the ticket to his and his family\u2019s freedom.At the onset of the Civil War, the  (with Smalls among its crew) was commissioned by the Confederacy for a variety of wartime activities, during which the ship played a role in destroying a Union lighthouse, transporting arms, and mapping the intricacies of the Atlantic coast. By May 1862, the Union Navy had set up a large blockade around much of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, cutting of the shipment of supplies to the Confederacy. Smalls and his fellow slaves quietly developed plans to surrender to the Union ships that comprised this blockade.Gregarious, intelligent, and reliable, Smalls had been granted a great deal of trust by the white Confederates in charge of the , and on the night of 12 May 1862, the white officers left the ship in his charge while it was in port. This was the opportunity Smalls and his band had been waiting for. Smalls sneaked his family and several other slaves onto the ship and took it out of port, a complex task that involved impersonating the white captain of the ship by wearing his wide-brimmed straw hat while expertly giving secret coded signals to Confederate checkpoints. Gates described that moment as follows:After a tense approach in which Union ships almost opened fire on the , Smalls surrendered the ship and, along with it, a massive cargo of artillery that just happened to be stored aboard. According to U.S Navy accounts, Smalls\u2019 first words upon reaching the blockade were, \u201cGood morning, sir! I\u2019ve brought you some of the old United States guns, sir!\u201dSmalls became a celebrity in the North and had a $4,000 bounty put on his head by the Confederacy. In addition to securing his freedom, Small was awarded $1,500 as a reward for the ship and its guns, which he used after the war to purchase the home in which he was born from his former master. According to Gates, Smalls \u201cpersonally lobbied the Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to begin enlisting black soldiers. After President Lincoln acted a few months later, Smalls was said to have recruited 5,000 soldiers by himself.\u201d According to a biography of Smalls provided by the U.S. House of Representatives:In one of those engagements, Smalls refused to surrender to a Confederate ship in the face of his commanding officer\u2019s cowardice, which led to his becoming the first black captain of a United States ship:Following the war, Smalls entered political life, and from 1870 to 1874 he served in the South Carolina state senate before easily winning a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican. Smalls served five non-consecutive House terms before South Carolina was redistricted by Democrats to limit the number of blacks elected to Congress. Jim Crow, voter suppression, and violence overtook the Reconstruction-era politics in which he was a key player:Smalls died a free man in the same Beaufort, South Carolina, property where he had been born a slave. By the time of his death in 1915, however, Smalls had become a U.S. Representative, a war hero, a civil rights activist, and a homeowner. \u201cMy race needs no special defense,\u201d he famously said, \u201cfor the past history of them in this country proves them to be equal of any people anywhere.

As of late August 2018, the fire had consumed more than 400,000 acres of land, making it the largest wildfire in California history.The complaint came to light as part of a lawsuit filed by attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the County of Santa Clara, the Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District, and the California Public Utilities Commission, seeking to overturn the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s move to repeal net neutrality rules. Bowden made his allegation in an addendum to an amicus brief filed by the complainants:Bowden said the data throttling primarily affected one specific vehicle, OES 5262, which his department employed to \u201ctrack, organize, and prioritize routing of resources from around the state and country to the sites where they are most needed\u201d during the blaze.

Both sides were unhappy with the ruling, according to the\u2018s 2004 coverage of the trial:On appeal, both the defendants (Officer Gaines et al) and the plaintiffs (the Hundley family) challenged that ruling, as described in court documents:This appeal was heard by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and the opinion was written by Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who later became President Trump\u2019s controversial nominee to the Supreme Court. The crux of the appeal argument centered on jury inconsistency. In the original trial, the jury was asked to rule on the three issues brought to the court and, in what is known as an interrogatory jury question, on the reliability or truth of Officer Gaines\u2019 version of events:Both the lawyers representing Gaines as well as the lawyers representing the interests of the Hundley family pointed to this fact as a reason for appeal, as jury inconsistency is a valid grounds for appeal under in Federal Law. In the Hundley family\u2019s case, they argued that \u201cthe jury\u2019s written interrogatory response is inconsistent with the jury\u2019s findings for defendants on the assault and battery and excessive force claims.\u201d Gaines et al, on the other hand, pointed to the finding as a reason to reject the damages awarded to the Hundleys by the jury, as their verdict with respect to negligence relied on a narrative the jury themselves said was not truthful. Kavanaugh agreed that the jury verdict was inconsistent:Ultimately, Kavanaugh rendered a 180-degree shift on both sides of this argument. He ruled that because the negligence claim relied on a narrative deemed false by the jury, that that charge and the damages awarded because of it should be overturned. This aspect of the decision has led to the online narrative that \u201ca jury found that a cop lied [but] Brett Kavanaugh threw out the verdict\u201d:While this meme expresses a factually accurate statement, it tells only a portion of the story. Using the same logic that prompted the reversal of the negligence charge, Kavanaugh also overturned the earlier rulings that did not hold the officer liable for assault or excessive force, remanding that aspect of the case for a new trial: It is uncertain if the Hundley family sought a retrial after this ruling or reached a settlement with the defendants. (An email to the lawyer who represented the Hundley\u2019s in this matter was not immediately returned.) Regardless, Kavanaugh\u2019s ruling did have the effect of reversing a cash settlement given to the Hundley family, but it also allowed for a new trial on first two claims the Hundleys had lost during their initial trial.

The relevant section, translated from German, read as follows:The event in question was a panel discussion overseen by  reporter Gregor Peter Schmitz during the 2013 German-American Young Leaders conference, an annual gathering run by Atlantik-Br\u00fccke (\u201cAtlantic Bridge\u201d), a Berlin-based non-profit organization that aims to cultivate political, business and civic society links between the United States and Germany.Carter can be seen making unrelated remarks in a short video review of the event, posted online by Atlantik-Br\u00fccke:The organization\u2019s 2013-14 annual report described Carter\u2019s participation as follows:The reference to Carter\u2019s \u201cconcerns and hopes for the future of democracy in the U.S. and abroad\u201d lends credence to the quotation attributed to him in , but we were not able to find corroboration for it.A spokesperson for the Carter Center, the former president\u2019s non-profit organization through which he often makes public statements, told us by email that they could not verify the \u201cno functioning democracy\u201d statement. We also asked the Carter Center whether they disputed the authenticity of the quotation but we did not receive a response.A spokesperson for Atlantik-Br\u00fccke told us that the organization did not have access to any footage of Carter\u2019s remarks other than the few seconds included in the video summary of the event above. We asked Atlantik-Br\u00fccke to put us in touch with the person who captured that footage but did not receive a response.We also contacted Gregor Peter Schmitz, author of the 2013  article and the sole originator of the quotation in question. We requested any material, such as video or audio footage or contemporaneous notes, which might corroborate the authenticity of the quotation but did not receive a response.Certain factors lend credence to the authenticity of the quotation: Carter was undoubtedly present at the event in question, his spokesperson did not dispute its authenticity when invited to do so, a separate description of his remarks at the event alluded to his \u201cconcerns and hopes for the future of democracy in the U.S. and abroad,\u201d and the quotation is in keeping with other statements Carter has made in recent years.Notably, Carter has given dire pronouncements about the state of American democracy during both the Obama and Trump administrations. Mostly, these assessments have related to the role of money in electoral politics.In 2015, the former president told Democracy Now\u2019s Thom Hartmann that the United States was \u201cjust an oligarchy.\u201d In response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in , which significantly upheld the right of corporate entities to make political donations, Hartmann suggested that the ruling was a \u201cviolation of the principles of democracy,\u201d andd Carter replied: \u201cIt violates the essence of what made America a great country, in its political system. Now it\u2019s just an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting nominations for president \u2026\u201dIn September 2017, Carter again raised the specter of the United States as an oligarchy rather than a democracy. In a discussion at the Carter Center, he again cited what he called the \u201cstupid\u201d  decision and proclaimed: \u201cI would say that we\u2019ve become kind of more of an oligarchy than we have a democracy, now. The rich people and the powerful people in our country decide a lot of who gets the nomination and therefore who is elected to office \u2014 not just presidents but senators and governors and Congress members.\u201dIn a March 2018 interview with PBS News Hour, Carter said Americans had \u201clost faith in democracy,\u201d and that the increased role of money in elections meant \u201cwe are moving toward an oligarchy \u2026 compared to a true democracy.\u201dHowever, despite the eminent credibility of Jimmy Carter\u2019s having proclaimed in 2013 \u201cAmerica has no functioning democracy at this moment,\u201d this quotation originated with a single news article, and we were unable to retrieve evidence that would corroborate its authenticity.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: The problem of gun crime in the United States, and in particular mass shootings in schools and other public places, has defied universally accepted solutions for the past couple of decades.One common proposition, particularly popular among conservatives, is that the primary cause of such shootings is a disintegration of traditional morality and Christian values in the United States.That viewpoint found its way into a Texas U.S. Senate election debate in September 2018, when incumbent Republican senator Ted Cruz argued that \u201cremoving God from the public square\u201d and \u201closing the moral foundation of much of our society\u201d were partly to blame for school shootings:On Twitter, John Rehling criticized what he perceived as Cruz\u2019s argument, offering some comparative statistics on religious affiliation and gun crime in Japan and the state of Texas:Rehling\u2019s tweet was later reposted by the pro-science Facebook page Skepticus, garnering further exposure for his claims:The numbers included in Rehling\u2019s tweet were very accurate (although not perfectly so), and the best evidence we found in some instances actually offered stronger support for his overall argument: Christians do indeed make up a large majority of residents of Texas, where on average even more than one fatal school shooting takes place every year.Christians likely make up even less than two percent of the population in Japan, which has no recorded instance of a fatal school shooting, and which has a rate of gun death more than 500 times lower than that seen in the United States.This number appears to be a slight exaggeration, but Rehling\u2019s broader point, that Texas is  overwhelmingly Christian, still stands.According to the Pew Research Center\u2019s 2014 \u201cReligious Landscape Study,\u201d 77 percent of Texans identified as Christian, with evangelical Protestants (31 percent) and Catholics (23 percent) making up the bulk of that contingent. This rate of Christian affiliation ranked joint seventh-highest in the United States. (Louisiana had the highest at 86 percent, and Vermont the lowest at 54 percent.)No official government database tracks shootings that take place in schools or colleges in the United States, so it\u2019s not possible to arrive at a definitive number, but the rate mentioned by Rehling for Texas (one fatal school shooting per year) appears to be a slight underestimation.Perhaps the most reliable and comprehensive unofficial source of data on school shootings is the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), which defines a school shooting as \u201can incident that occurs on property of the elementary, secondary or college campus where there is a death or injury from gunfire.\u201dAccording to GVA data, Texas experience:So between January 2015 and October 2018, an average of 2.5 fatal school shootings took place in Texas per year, leading to an average of five deaths per year (although the latter figure is heavily skewed by the May 2018 Santa Fe high school shooting, in which 10 people were killed).If one limits the numbers to only include fatal shootings in elementary, middle, and high schools, seven such incidents were recorded between 2015 and 2018, leaving an average of 1.75 shootings per year.Another comprehensive database is the one maintained by Everytown for Gun Safety. Although Everytown is not impartial on the issue of gun violence (they advocate for stricter gun control laws), their database contains good references and sourcing for every such incident, and it also records shootings at colleges as well as elementary and high schools.According to Everytown, Texas schools experienced:Based on those figures, an average of exactly one fatal school shooting per year took place between 2013 and 2018, with an average of 2.5 deaths per year. If one includes suicides, two fatal school shootings occurred per year between 2013 and 2018, accounting for 3.7 deaths per year.Although methodologies and figures vary, Rehling\u2019s claim of \u201ca fatal school shooting every year\u201d in Texas appears to be a very conservative estimate, and likely a significant understatement. Our determination, based on the reliable data sources we consulted, actually provides greater support for Rehling\u2019s broader argument.This figure actually appears to be a somewhat generous estimate of the prevalence of Christianity in Japanese society. According to the Pew Research Center\u2019s \u201cGlobal Religious Landscape\u201d study, 1.6 percent of people in Japan identified as Christians in 2010.A November 2017 Pew Research Center presentation cited two sources which gave even lower estimates. According to the University of Michigan\u2019s Japanese General Social Survey, 0.7 percent of Japanese people identified as Christians in 2015, and according to Japanese government research from 2015 the figure was 1.5 percent.Although Rehling\u2019s figure of \u201c2% Christian\u201d appears to be a slight overstatement, our determination once again actually offers greater support to his broader argument.We could find no record of a shooting (fatal or otherwise) having taken place at a school or university in Japan in recent memory. Rehling\u2019s assessment is accurate: what is a frequent phenomenon in the United States, including Texas, simply does not happen in Japan.On the whole, Japan has among the lowest rates of gun crime in the developed world. For example, the rate of gun deaths per 100,000 people was 0.02 in Japan in 2014, according to GunPolicy.org, a research initiative run by the University of Sydney, Australia. In the United States, the gun death rate was 10.54 in 2014, a figure that\u2019s more than 500 times higher.A 2016 article on the  news website asked \u201cWhat are the chances of a mass shooting in Japan?\u201d and outlined the strict laws and procedures surrounding gun ownership there: Evaluate the following assertion: The school shooting rate in non-Christian Japan is vastly lower than that of mostly Christian Texas.

Pell made the infamous statement during a World Youth Day event in July 2002, in reply to an American youth minister\u2019s asking him how Catholics should respond to questions regarding the findings of systematic sexual abuse committed by church officials. When asked to explain his rationale, Pell (who at the time was the Archbishop of Sydney) said, \u201cBecause [abortion] is always a destruction of human life.\u201dThe following month, Pell maintained that while the original reporting on his comment did not mention his condemnation of sexual abuse, he would not backtrack on the original statement:On 24 February 2014, Pell (who was by that point a cardinal) was appointed by Pope Francis to oversee the newly-created Secretariat for the Economy, granting Pell \u201cauthority over all economic and administrative activities\u201d in the Vatican. Since then he has been described by multiple news outlets as being the Vatican\u2019s third-highest ranking official.Allegations of sexual abuse against Pell date to 2002, when he was accused of having molested a 12-year-old boy in 1961. An inquiry commissioned by the National Committee for Professional Standards, a group overseen by the Catholic Church of Australia, determined that the allegations were \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201dBut in June 2017, Pell was charged with historical sexual assault, a term used to an identify alleged offense that took place in the non-recent past. While some of those charges have been dismissed, on 1 May 2018 Pell was ordered to stand trial on other counts. He pleaded not guilty. Coverage of the trial in Australia was suppressed under a court-imposed order, but on 11 December 2018 Pell was reportedly convicted of abusing two choir boys in the country during his tenure as archbishop of Melbourne in the 1990s.

The incident itself, described in local news accounts, is real:The stricken girl was ultimately diagnosed with ADEM, and while most cases of ADEM resolve completely or carry only minor long-term consequences, this case left the patient in a wheelchair and has caused lasting neurological damage. While devastating, the event\u2019s causal relationship to the flu shot is a much more complicated area of science, one that has been misrepresented repeatedly in the anti-vaccine posts that have used this family\u2019s story to advance their fear-driven agenda. A representative example can be found on the conspiracy mill website known as \u201cNatural News\u201d:A 2016 review of ADEM in the journal  described the disease as belonging to a group of poorly understood conditions known as \u201cimmune-mediated demyelinating CNS disorders.\u201d A demyelinating process is one that damages or removes the protective covering surrounding the nerve fibers of the central nervous system, known as a myelin sheath. An immune-mediated demyelinating process is one caused by the body\u2019s own immune system attacking these surfaces, leading to neurological damage:Because ADEM is an immune-mediated disease, vaccines have long been considered as a plausible trigger for the condition, which is most commonly thought to be caused by the body\u2019s inflammatory response to various viral or bacterial infections.Evidence for a possible minor link to the MMR vaccine, mentioned above in the Natural News post, has been published, although those conclusions have been disputed, and no widespread epidemiological study has ever found clear evidence of a causal relationship between ADEM and the  vaccine, as alleged in the viral story. This is likely why Natural News and other similar outlets rely upon a vaccine injury lawyer, whose livelihood stems from fees garnered from bringing complaints to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, to assert the connection. A 2015 review of the influenza vaccine\u2019s overall safety concluded that evidence was insufficient to \u201cestablish a causal relationship between influenza vaccines and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis\u201d:In fact, the risk of developing ADEM directly following influenza inoculation may well be lower than the risk of developing ADEM without receiving the influenza vaccine. A 2014 paper that reviewed cases of central nervous system demyelination (like ADEM) following vaccinations of any kind concluded that \u201cThe risk of onset or relapse of CNS demyelination following infections against which the vaccines are aimed to protect is substantially higher, and the benefits of vaccinations surpass the potential risks of CNS inflammation.\u201dRare neurological disorders which have their onset at around the time a child is of the correct age to receive a vaccine are often asserted to be caused by those vaccines based on temporal proximity, despite a lack of conclusive evidence to draw a mechanistic link. The available evidence does not support a connection between ADEM and the flu vaccine, but the condition is so rare that insufficient data exists to robustly prove a lack of causation at this time. As such, claims that the 9-year-old girl in Tampa developed as a result of the flu shot is unproven. Evaluate the following assertion: A 9-year-old girl was paralyzed as a result of receiving a flu shot.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In October 2018, several suspicious packages were sent to high-profile Democratic party figures including former president Barack Obama, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Joe Biden, and liberal financier George SorosLaw enforcement officials said the packages contained suspected explosive devices, although none of them detonated or caused any physical injury. The episode prompted widespread concern and increased political tensions in the lead-up to the 6 November midterm elections, especially after authorities in Florida arrested 56-year-old Cesar Sayoc, a supporter of President Donald Trump, in connection with the packages.The mailings also engendered conspiracy theories, chief among them the notion that the sending of the suspicious packages, the contents of many of which had the appearance of pipe bombs, was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation, orchestrated by liberals to stoke outrage against President Donald Trump on account of his past violent rhetoric.Against this background, a viral meme emerged on 24 October which some promoters cited as evidence that the \u201cpipe bomb\u201d mailings were a politically-motivated hoax rather than a genuine effort to harm or intimidate perceived liberal Democrats:This message reappeared on multiple different Facebook accounts, in many cases prompting comments which held that the pipe bombs were a hoax or news reports about the mail terror campaign were fake. The logic of this argument went as follows:On 22 October, a suspected explosive device was found in a package in the mailbox outside the suburban New York home of George Soros, a billionaire financier and philanthropist who is a frequent target of right-wing attacks and misinformation for his funding of liberal and progressive causes.Later, federal officials told the  that the package was likely hand-delivered rather than being sent through the mail.Two days later, the U.S. Secret Service intercepted two potential explosive devices which had been addressed to the upstate New York home of Hillary and Bill Clinton, and the Washington, D.C., home of the Obama family, respectively. In a statement about those mailings, the Secret Service wrote:While it\u2019s true that some initial reports stated that these packages had been found at or delivered to the homes, the vast majority of news articles correctly stipulated that the packages had been  residential addresses but had been intercepted by the Secret Service before arrival.So it\u2019s worth noting that the misinformation the meme sought to point out was largely absent from news reports, which were overwhelmingly careful to point out, even in headlines, that the suspicious packages had never made it to the homes of the Obamas or Clintons.The Secret Service does appear to have a policy of not allowing the USPS or other companies to directly deliver mail to anyone who is under the agency\u2019s protection, such as the Obama and Clinton families, though we were unable to confirm this definitively.The Secret Service\u2019s press release on the packages referred to \u201croutine mail screening procedures\u201d and mentioned that neither the Obamas nor Clintons were \u201cat risk of receiving them.\u201d This information strongly suggested that postal workers do not, as a matter of policy, directly deliver mail addressed to Secret Service protectees.We asked the agency to confirm this point, but a spokesperson told us: \u201cFor operational security reasons, the Secret Service does not discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods we utilize to carry out our protective responsibilities.\u201dLikewise, a spokesperson for USPS responded to our queries by writing: \u201cWe are not able to address your specific questions.\u201d We also asked UPS and FedEx to clarify whether their employees ever directly deliver mail to Secret Service protectees, and a spokesperson for the former told us that \u201cUPS has layered security measures, but we do not disclose them to maintain their effectiveness.\u201d We did not receive a substantive response from FedEx.On 24 October, a man who identified himself as an employee of FedEx and a former employee of USPS called into the Roger and JP Show on the Florida radio station WHPT (The Bone), and his contribution to the show can be heard here (starting around the five-minute mark). Roughly speaking, he told the hosts that the Secret Service always examines packages addressed to \u201ca celebrity, like Barack Obama or Donald Trump.\u201d By this it appears he meant that the Secret Service always examines packages addressed to someone under its protection. As we have outlined, this appears to be true.This does not mean that reporting about the packages, in general, was false, or that the episode constituted a hoax or a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation. In a press conference on 26 October, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray emphasized that the 13 devices sent to various intended recipients were \u201cnot hoax devices\u201d:As of 26 October, suspect Cesar Sayoc, who frequently posted online about his support for President Trump and distaste for Democrats, CNN and George Soros, had not given a public explanation for his alleged actions.  However, no evidence supports the theory that the mail bomb campaign was part of a hoax or false flag conspiracy intended to stoke outrage among opponents of President Trump and the Republican party, to the benefit of Democrats in the mideterm elections.The viral meme which quotes a former USPS worker has been presented on social media as proof that the news media was deliberately misleading the public about the delivery of packages to the homes of the Obamas and Clintons, and therefore evidence that the entire episode constituted a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation. But this was not the case, not least because the vast majority of news articles accurately reported the fact that the Secret Service intercepted the explosive devices before they arrived at their intended destinations. Evaluate the following assertion: News media claims of bombs sent by mail to the Clintons and Obamas were false because USPS doesn't deliver mail to persons under Secret Service protection.

Like many of the videos previously published by O\u2019Keefe and Project Veritas, the one published on 1 November was heavily edited, making the context of many conversation fragments and statements unclear:O\u2019Keefe has attracted criticism for editing and framing video footage in such a way as to unfairly harm the reputation of progressive organizations and politicians, and he has faced multiple lawsuits and even a criminal conviction for illegally entering the office of U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu in an attempt to tamper with her telephones.We sent the O\u2019Rourke campaign a set of questions related to the footage. In response, Chris Evans, a spokesperson for the U.S. Representative for Texas\u2019 16th District, directed us to remarks he offered to the , in which he acknowledged that some campaign staffers had \u2018taken it upon themselves\u2019 to donate around $300 worth of supplies to a local charity helping migrants:Some of the footage posted on 1 November also appeared to show campaign staff discussing the possibility of using campaign vehicles to give rides to migrants, but the video did not show anyone actually doing that or even talking about  taken that action. In response to our questions, the O\u2019Rourke campaign asserted that no staff had used campaign vehicles to give rides to any migrants.In the video posted on 1 November, O\u2019Keefe said that \u201ccharity is not a bad thing\u201d but accused the O\u2019Rourke campaign staff of breaking the law in their efforts to donate supplies: \u201cWe support charity at Project Veritas Action, but you cannot break the law to do it \u2026\u201dRoughly speaking, it is prohibited for a political campaign to spend campaign money for what\u2019s known as \u201cpersonal use.\u201d For spending to be considered campaign-related, it must be for a purpose that arises only in the context of a campaign. As the FEC guidelines state: \u201cIf the expense would exist even in the absence of the candidacy or even if the officeholder were not in office, then the personal use ban applies.\u201dThe logic of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s argument was that when the O\u2019Rourke campaign staff bought food and supplies to help the migrants, they were spending campaign money on something that was not strictly campaign-related, and therefore they had violated the \u201cpersonal use\u201d rules.However, what O\u2019Keefe did not mention is that exceptions to those rules exist, one of which allows political campaigns to donate to charities (under certain conditions):The footage published by O\u2019Keefe on 1 November did not constitute evidence of a member of the O\u2019Rourke campaign team\u2019s using campaign funds to give supplies  to the migrants, as opposed to donating them to Annunciation House, a registered charity in El Paso.We asked the O\u2019Rourke campaign whether any of their staff had given supplies purchased with campaign money directly to any migrants. A spokesperson firmly denied this, writing: \u201cAbsolutely not. The materials were dropped off to Annunciation House \u2026 at the donation site Annunciation House had set up.\u201dWe asked Project Veritas whether it had uncovered any evidence (not shown in their video) of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign staff providing supplies directly to the migrants (as opposed to the charity). A spokesperson for the organization did not directly answer that question but reiterated that they had found evidence of campaign staff discussing an intention to buy supplies for the migrants and to give them rides in a campaign vehicle.

Trump vowed to refuse entry to the caravan and sent active duty military to the border, and he stepped up pressure on Mexico and Central American countries to halt its progress, threatening to cut off foreign aid if they did not:Contrary to what the meme stated, some travelers with the caravan did accept an offer proposed by Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto for temporary identification papers and jobs. The Reuters news agency reported on 27 October 2018 that some 1,700 caravan members had applied for asylum in Mexico, while others had returned to their home countries or rejected the offer:To qualify for the program, dubbed \u201cEstas en Tu Casa\u201d (\u201cYou Are Home\u201d), migrants had to be in Mexico\u2019s southern states of Chiapas or Oaxaca.

The information Gateway Pundit published was based on a tweet posted by Jeff Kottkamp, a former lieutenant governor of Florida:Although the information Kottkamp posted was accurate, there was much more to the story. For starters, the event took place in 2016; and contrary to what Gateway Pundit reported, only one such incident occurred. But by 13\u00a0November 2018, amid simmering controversy over Florida election recounts, butchered, confusing versions of the story went viral and led anxious readers to believe it referred to current events.In November 2016, Chelsey Marie Smith, a temp worker at the Supervisor of Elections Office (SOE) in Broward County, filed an affidavit reporting that she saw election officials filling out blank absentee ballots, believing she was seeing evidence of voter fraud in action. Smith stated she was then abruptly terminated. After investigating, however, the Florida State Attorney\u2019s Office in Broward County found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.In the affidavit, Smith stated that she was sent to deliver a stack of absentee ballot requests to a room in the office known as Pitney-Bowers. When she got the door, she noted it was locked and a key code was needed to get inside. When she was let through the door, Smith witnessed several election officials filling out blank absentee ballots.If Smith had witnessed voter fraud in action, it would have been a crime. Upon investigation, however, Timothy Donnelly, assistant state attorney in charge of the public corruption unit in Broward County found no evidence of wrongdoing. Instead, he wrote in a 15\u00a0May 2017 memo that elections officials were creating duplicate ballots for soldiers stationed overseas who had faxed in absentee ballots:Smith\u2019s affidavit was filed with the 17th Judicial Circuit court as an exhibit in a 11\u00a0November 2018 lawsuit resulting from one of the state\u2019s narrow elections. Filed by agriculture commission candidate Matthew Caldwell, the suit alleged that ballots were illegally counted after polls closed on election day. The affidavit, signed by Smith on 3 November 2016, was submitted to support Caldwell\u2019s accusations of misconduct against Dr. Brenda Snipes, Broward County\u2019s elections supervisor.Caldwell, a Republican, filed suit after eking out what he expected to be a victory against challenger Nikki Fried, only to have his 40,000-point lead flip to a very narrow margin of a few thousand votes favoring Fried. Despite an ongoing recount, Fried declared victory and announced a transition team.In a phone interview on 13\u00a0November 2018, Kottkamp criticized Broward County election officials for what he called a lack of transparency that has fueled conspiracy theories and panic. For instance, he said, SOE officials failed to disclose how many votes were left to count. Had they done so, he told us, \u201cpeople would know the universe of ballots out there and they could have all done the math. But because they weren\u2019t willing to say how many votes were still out there to be counted, people were freaking out. You can understand why people were coming a little unglued about that.\u201dKottkamp stated that he felt his tweet was pertinent because the affidavit was brought up in an ongoing November 2018 election-related lawsuit. He also said he did not think the 2016 duplicate ballots should have been filled out behind closed doors and pointed out the Broward County SOE has been beset by controversy and accusations of mismanagement. Her office mistakenly mixed more than a dozen rejected ballots with valid ones.Meanwhile, without offering evidence, President Donald Trump and other Republicans levied accusations of fraud in Florida while current governor and Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rick Scott fired off a flurry of lawsuits as the recount is underway, also accusing Snipes and other elections officials of counting ballots after the deadline. Scott has himself been sued by voter advocates demanding he recuse himself from overseeing the election in which he has a stake.Despite the chaos, Kottkamp expressed optimism that the \u201cmess\u201d in Florida would be sorted out fairly, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll get there.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: A Broward County employee witnessed elections staff filling out blank absentee ballots.

Kujay\u2019s two-year-old account was referenced several times in the 2018 round of reporting.Vice News also cited the account of Sitty Hikmawatty, the commissioner for drugs and health with the Indonesian Committee on Child Protection, who said this practice was \u201calready a few years old.\u201d We spoke with Hikamawatty via Facebook Messenger to determine out how widespread this phenomenon was.Hikamawatty told us that she and others had stumbled across cases like this while monitoring the behavior of what she described as street children, and that the practice is generally found in \u201cslums\u201d and \u201cmining areas.\u201d When we asked how often she had come across this sort of behavior, she told us \u201cnot too often,\u201d adding that she and her colleagues began collaborating with a social worker to take the children into protection and rehabilitation programs.Indra Dwi Purnomo, the psychology lecturer, had worked on these cases in collaboration with the BNN as well, and he told the Indonesian news outlet  that the average culprit came from a poor family, was under stress, and included children who wanted to \u201cfeel happy\u201d but did not have any money and so engaged in experimentation.The more salacious aspect of this claim, that children are boiling soiled and bloody menstrual pads to get high, is harder to get a handle on. The claim appears to have been most confidently asserted by the Head of the National Narcotics Agency in Central Java Province, AKBP Suprinarto, who told  that \u201cused sanitary napkins are soaked. The boiled water is drunk.\u201d Purnomo, the psychology lecturer, told the Indonesian news outlet  that in past cases kids had used soiled pads for this purpose but seemed to indicate that might no longer be the case.The only on-the-record, first-hand account of using sanitary pads for the purposes of inebriation that we are aware of is that of 14-year-old \u201cKujay\u201d in 2016, who described the first step in the process as \u201cbuying\u201d the pads. This would indicate that he made use of unsoiled pads. We have reached out to the psychology department for which Purnomo works and to BNN to get an interview, but we have not received a response from either yet.We asked Sitty Hikmawatty from the Indonesian Committee on Child Protection what chemicals the children were after when they boiled sanitary pads, and she told us that it was the adsorbent gel. The exact ingredients used in sanitary pads are generally (and controversially) considered proprietary, so we can\u2019t know with certainty which chemicals these children are exposing themselves to by drinking their boiled remains, but testing performed by the advocacy group Women\u2019s Voices for the Earth has detected low concentrations of toxic chemicals with potential neurologic side effects in some brands, as reported by CNN in 2015:Presumably, however, such guidelines were not written to address the possibility that some people might boil these pads to concentrate and drink these chemicals. Testing undertaken by Indonesian Consumers Foundation in 2015 suggested that the majority of sanitary pads in Indonesia contained chlorine, the presence of which would be illegal in both Indonesia and the United States, and which when consumed or inhaled could also potentially cause some health problems, including blurred vision. In short, ingesting a slurry of unknown chemicals that may poison you could conceivably produce neurological side effects, but the exact mechanism is not entirely clear.The phenomenon of Indonesian children (reportedly) using sanitary pads to get inebriated is a reflection of poverty in the poorest parts of Indonesia and is not, as has been repeated ad infinitum in the social media and clickbait echo chamber, a \u201ctrend.\u201d It seems clear that some children have tried this, though all indications point to the practice\u2019s being fairly rare. It is unclear, however, whether soiled pads have been used in the boiling process, as stated in many headlines, but the desired effect allegedly comes from the chemicals used in the manufacturing process of the pads, so the use of soiled pads would merely be an even more extreme reflection of poverty.All in all, the claim of a \u201cnew trend\u201d among Indonesian teens getting \u201cdrunk\u201d off of boiled bloody menstrual pads is a mixture of grim factual realities, exaggerations, speculations, and falsehoods. Evaluate the following assertion: Boiling menstrual pads and drinking the water to get \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cdrunk\u201d is an alarming new trend amongst Indonesian teens.

I\u2019m not a believer in man-made global warming.\u201d In recent years, Trump has frequently referred dismissively to the reality of global warming during periods of cold weather in the United States.Against that background of Trump\u2019s clear, consistent, and long-standing position on global warming and climate change \u2014 that he does not believe in a steady, man-made increase in the global temperature \u2014 reports from the spring of 2016 prompted accusations of hypocrisy on the part of the then-Republican front-runner in that year\u2019s presidential election.On 23 May, the website  reported that Trump, while dismissing global warming as a hoax in his political rhetoric, was taking a very different approach in his private business dealings. The article carried the headline \u201cTrump acknowledges climate change \u2014 at his golf course\u201d:That article gained widespread traction in 2016, at a time when Trump\u2019s once-ridiculed presidential campaign had gained enormous momentum, leaving him as the presumptive Republican nominee. It was aggregated by CBS News, the , the , and other news outlets.In December 2018, the left-wing Facebook page \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d posted a meme citing the  article which read:In 2014, the Trump Organization (led by Donald Trump) bought a golf course and resort at Doughmore Bay in Doonbeg, Co. Clare, on Ireland\u2019s Atlantic west coast. Subsequently, Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Enterprises Ltd (TIGL) tried to get planning permission from national and local authorities in Ireland to build a limestone berm (a kind of raised land bank) along a section of Doughmore Bay, with the intention of preventing further erosion of sand dunes adjacent to the golf course.In February 2016, the company submitted an application to Clare County Council, which subsequently referred the case to An Bord Plean\u00e1la (\u201cthe planning board\u201d), the national body in Ireland that rules on planning applications of strategic importance, as well as disputes that may arise on the level of Ireland\u2019s 31 local authorities (such as Clare County Council).An Bord Plean\u00e1la declined to rule on the application, holding that it was not a \u201cstrategic infrastructure development,\u201d and thereby returning the decision to Clare County Council.On 10 May 2016, an Irish planning and environment consultancy firm called Cunnane Stratton Reynolds applied to Clare County Council, again seeking permission on behalf of TIGL, to build \u201ccoastal erosion management works at and adjacent Carrowmore dunes, White Strand, Doughmore Bay, and Trump International Golf Links and Hotel.\u201dCunnane Stratton Reynolds acted as the official agent of TIGL in this process, with the then-U.S. presidential candidate listed in the planning application as a director of the company, along with his children Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Jr. (President Trump resigned as a company director in January 2017, but he retains a 100 percent ownership stake in the golf course and earned more than $14 million from it in 2017, according to his financial disclosure.)European Union law requires that in E.U. member states such as Ireland, planning applications be accompanied by two important documents known as an Environmental Impact Statement and a Natura Impact Statement.As part of the Doonbeg application, an Irish environmental consultancy firm called Creagh House Environmental prepared the Environmental Impact Statement on behalf of TIGL. This was the source of the quotations included in Politico\u2019s article.It was that three-volume Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) which on several occasions referred to global warming and climate change as being a threat to the sand dunes which the limestone wall was intended to protect, in two ways: because the rise in sea levels brought by climate change will continue to cause Ireland\u2019s coastline (including the coastline at Doughmore Bay) to recede, and because climate change is associated with extreme weather events such as strong storms, which have also been shown to accelerate the erosion of the sand dunes in question.For example, Volume One of the EIS described the damage that dune erosion causes to groundwater (water immediately below the surface) at Doughmore Bay:The document went on to note that:Volume Three of the EIS comprised three \u201cdesign reports,\u201d one of which was prepared by HR Wallingford, a civil engineering firm based near Oxford, England. One section of that report (\u201cDoonbeg Golf Resort \u2014 Review of Coastal Processes\u201d) outlined the medium- to long-term prospect of further erosion of the sand dunes at Doughmore Bay:This was the section highlighted by  in their article, which correctly stated that the HR Wallingford report \u201cacknowledges one Irish government study [the Office of Public Works study] that assumes a steady rate of erosion through 2050, but argues that the study fails to account for the effects of climate change.\u201dHowever, the next paragraphs in the HR Wallingford report played down the contribution that rising sea levels (caused by climate change) make to the rate of coastal erosion, instead emphasizing the important role of extreme storms \u2014 events that, according to this part of the HR Wallingford report, are less clearly associated with global warming:In summary, the HR Wallingford report speculated that the increase in sea levels off the coast of Ireland, a phenomenon the report associated with climate change, could accelerate over the next few decades, in turn causing an acceleration in the erosion of the sand dunes at Doughmore Bay.However, the report estimated that this increase in sea levels accounted for 10-20 percent of the erosion of the sand dunes, instead emphasizing the role of strong and damaging storm events, which  (according to the report) have a more ambiguous, less clear connection with global warming.Interestingly, these references to climate change and global warming did not appear in an updated version of the HR Wallingford report submitted in December 2016. Similarly, an updated version of Volume One of the EIS also no longer contains any references to climate change.Trump\u2019s company withdrew their May 2016 application, then submitted a new proposal for a scaled-down version of the wall, which Clare County Council eventually accepted in December 2017. That decision is subject to an ongoing legal challenge, meaning construction on the wall had not started as of December 2018.Donald Trump did not personally invoke global warming and climate change as real phenomena and a genuine threat to the future of his Irish golf course, nor did anyone from the Trump Organization or Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Enterprises Ltd.However, an Environmental Impact Statement written  TIGL (of which Trump was a company director, and which he still owns) did indeed repeatedly refer to global warming and climate change as real phenomena with specific consequences (rising sea levels and more frequent, stronger storms) which posed a threat to the sand dunes at Doughmore Bay, and therefore to Trump\u2019s golf resort at Doonbeg, Co. Clare.We don\u2019t know whether, or to what extent, Trump\u2019s company TIGL altered or influenced the final Environmental Impact Statement, but we do know that Trump\u2019s company allowed that report to be submitted, on its behalf, as part of a planning application in May 2016.  We also know that when the company submitted a fresh planning application in December 2016, the references to climate change and global warming had been removed from updated versions of those documents.

His take on the banana is especially popular:This graphic is an accurate representation of the chemical constituents of your average banana, information that can be verified with the USDA Agricultural Research Database, which compiles studies into the nutritional and chemical content of various food items.Part of what Kennedy was trying to convey with his illustration was that even completely natural foods, when described scientifically, can sound unnatural and potentially unhealthy, as reported in the :If these ingredients are considered hierarchically, the banana sounds much more simple. Like all fruit, it contains water, sugars, starch, fiber, amino acids, fatty acids, minerals (i.e., ash), and chemicals that impart their coloring. Myriad names can be ascribed to the various different chemicals that fit these groups, and Kennedy used a variety of different nomenclatural methods to make that point.The most common grouping of chemicals in the banana are sugars, and in this case the sugars are predominantly glucose and fructose, with lesser amounts of sucrose and maltose. After starch, a polysaccharide chemical found in abundance in plants, the next listed set of chemicals is fiber, another common group of carbohydrate chemicals.Kennedy represented the fiber as a group of chemicals listed by their \u201cE numbers\u201d, which are codes assigned to substances permitted as food additives within the European Union. In reality, all of these chemicals are either cellulose (the most common chemical in plants) or various breakdown products of cellulose:After the fiber, Kennedy listed amino acids, a group of simple chemicals ubiquitous to life on this planet. All the chemicals listed are present in bananas, according to the USDA. Fatty acids, the next group of chemicals, are similarly ubiquitous in nature, and all of those chemicals listed above are also found in bananas. Likewise, ash is another way of referring to the mineral content of a food item, and in this case Kennedy used a variety of different chemical-naming conventions to obscure the fact that each of them is commonly known by other names:Similarly, the coloring agents \u2014 all of which are natural \u2014 might be better recognized by different names:The remaining chemicals may sound intimidating, but they too are natural. E1510 is another name for ethanol, which forms naturally as fruit ferments. The final \u201cnatural ripening agent,\u201d ethylene gas, might sound downright nefarious but actually represents a neat intersection of plant and food science. In nature, the gas is a plant hormone associated with aging that triggers the ripening process. In the food industry, the gas is used on industrial scales to ripen a variety of fruits and vegetables all at once.In sum, this graphic accurately depicts the chemicals that comprise a banana, using a variety of tactics to make that completely natural food appear to be full of \u201cchemicals\u201d \u2014 something originally created by a high school chemistry teacher as part of a lesson on chemophobia.

That program is for people with low to moderate incomes or living with disabilities.But it is unclear whether Cowen would have the ability to carry out evictions in the event the government shutdown, which began in December 2018, continued to stop landlords from receiving the federal subsidies.

This image was frequently attached to the claim that the pictured canine was a police dog put into the back seat of the vehicle in a futile attempt to \u201cintimidate\u201d King:\u201cIn June 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was placed in the back seat of a police car in St. Augustine, Florida. A police dog was put into the car with  him in an apparent attempt to intimidate King. Instead, the two promptly became friends. Today we honor this great man and the legacy of love and unity he left behind.\u201dThe above is a genuine photograph of Martin Luther King, Jr. sitting in the back seat of a police vehicle in the company of a police dog. However, we couldn\u2019t find any credible sources to support the claim that the dog had been put there in an attempt to intimidate King, or that King and the dog subsequently \u201cbecame friends.\u201dThe photograph was taken on 12 June 1964 and captured King and the dog as they were being escorted back to jail from King\u2019s grand jury testimony in St. Augustine, Florida, following his arrest the day prior for staging a sit-in at a segregated restaurant.Here are some other images of King and the dog in the police car, as well as the captions that accompanied them from the \u00a0the\u00a0State Library and Archives of Florida, and the Civil Rights Library of St. Augustine:We haven\u2019t been able to locate any accounts asserting that the dog was employed as a pawn in an attempt to intimidate King. In fact, the dog was mentioned as a superfluous detail in most the contemporaneous reports we encountered. The claim that the dog was used for intimidation purposes (and that King and the dog became friends) looks to be a modern interpretation based solely on the optics of the photograph and appears to have been posted first (without any citations or supporting evidence) by the \u201cDogs in History\u201d blog in May 2016.The historical record doesn\u2019t appear to support such an interpretation, however.This claim insinuates that this photograph was taken in the immediate aftermath of King\u2019s arrest and that police officers used the dog in an attempt to intimate and subdue an unruly activist. But that wasn\u2019t the case: the picture was snapped the day after King\u2019s arrest, as he was escorted from giving grand jury testimony.Another reading could be that the dog was used to intimidate King before he testified to the grand jury about segregation in St. Augustine, but again, that isn\u2019t what happened: this picture was taken after King\u2019s testimony, not before.This claim makes even less sense when considering the fact that police officers had been protecting King and other demonstrators from angry mobs for several days prior to the taking of this photograph.Here\u2019s a brief rundown of the events that preceded this picture:Martin Luther King, Jr. and other civil rights leaders staged a number of marches, protests, and sit-ins in St. Augustine, Florida, in the summer of 1964, and because these acts of non-violent civil disobedience often drew counter-protesters and escalated the possibilities violence, police officers were often on the scene.A report published in the  stated that more than 200 officers turned out to protect participants of an anti-segregation march on 10 June 1964, and when counter-protesters started hurling rocks at the demonstrators, police used dogs and tear gas to disperse the \u201cugly mob\u201d:While police offered protection to the protesters, they also arrested a number of the civil rights activists. On 11 June 1964, the day after the anti-segregation march was attacked by a white mob, King and several other demonstrators were arrested after they refused to leave a segregated restaurant in St. Augustine, as the  reported at the time:King was booked into St. Johns County jail but was moved to undisclosed facility during the night after officers became aware of several threats against the civil rights leader\u2019s life, as an Associated Press report published in the  noted:The next day, King was brought to testify in front of a grand jury to testify about segregation and racial violence in St. Augustine. The viral photograph was snapped after King gave his testimony and showed the civil rights leader as he was being escorted back to jail. A contemporary report from the Associated Press noted that a dog was \u201con the seat beside\u201d King but made no mention of the dog\u2019s purpose. Evaluate the following assertion: A photograph shows Martin Luther King Jr. in the back seat of a police car, along with a dog that was put there by officers an attempt to intimidate him.

The Native American activist told reporters in January 2019 that he was a \u201cVietnam-times\u201d or \u201cVietnam-era\u201d veteran, meaning that he was an active member of the armed services during the time of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam (not that he had been deployed to Vietnam during that period).News outlets such as the , CNN, and the  all published updates to their stories to correct that reporting:But the corrections indicated the misinformation had not come from Phillips himself.  CNN\u2019s transcript of their interview with Phillips twice included Phillips\u2019 referring to himself as a \u201cVietnam veteran,\u201d but the first instance was obviously a transcription error, as Phillips could clearly be heard saying that he was a \u201cVietnam-times veteran\u201d (not a \u201cVietnam veteran\u201d) in the network\u2019s video at the 38-second mark:Another portion of the interview transcript also quoted Phillips as using the term \u201cVietnam veteran\u201d in reference to himself, but since the CNN video only included selected excerpts from the longer interview (not including the part quoted below), we couldn\u2019t verify whether Phillips actually said \u201cVietnam veteran\u201d in that case or whether it was once again a transcription error:The  stated that their incorrect description had come from information provided by the Indigenous Peoples Movement, and the  noted that the leader of the Lakota People\u2019s Law Project said that group had erroneously represented Phillips as a Vietnam veteran, but that \u201cPhillips never told him that he served in Vietnam\u201d:In an older, rambling Facebook video that surfaced after the controversy broke, though, Phillips could seemingly be heard to say (at around the 9:35 mark) \u201cI\u2019m a Vietnam vet, and I served in Marine Corps 72 to 76. I got discharged May 5th, 1976 \u2026 I don\u2019t talk much about my Vietnam times. I usually say I don\u2019t recollect, I don\u2019t recall those years\u201d:But in other similar videos, Phillips described himself as a \u201cVietnam-era vet\u201d or referenced his Marine Corps service without mentioning Vietnam:In those many hours of interviews and videos, Phillips has made a number of unclear or ambiguous statements about his service that allow for a variety of interpretations (or misinterpretations).  In the first Facebook video linked above, for example, he stated \u2014 in reference to a form related to his discharge \u2014 that he left the service in peacetime and \u201cwhat my box says is that I was \u2018in theater.'\u201d  He didn\u2019t say  theater, though, nor did he directly declare that he was in fact \u2018in theater\u2019 during his time in the Marines. He cryptically observed something about a \u201cbox\u201d on his discharge form, and it was unclear whether he garbled whatever he was trying to say, was being deceptive, or was pointing out a mistake. In a 2018  article about Standing Rock, Phillips referenced Vietnam and his being \u201ca recon ranger,\u201d but again the statement was ambiguous \u2014 he said he was \u201cfrom Vietnam times\u201d and that \u201cI\u2019m what they call a recon ranger,\u201d but it was again unclear whether he intended his statement to convey that he had actually served as a \u201crecon ranger\u201d in Vietnam (which he did not), or whether he was using the term \u201crecon ranger\u201d to describe his post-military activities: According to Daniel Paul Nelson, Phillips\u2019 comments \u201cwere taken out of context and [he] actually was referring to the work they were doing at the time on the reservation.\u201dIn a 2008 article about Native American veterans, Phillips was cited as maintaining that he had been called \u201ca baby killer\u201d and spat upon \u2014 experiences commonly reported by Vietnam veterans returning to the U.S. \u2014 but that article now identifies him as a \u201cveteran of the Vietnam era\u201d and notes in a correction that \u201cThis article has been adjusted from its original version to show that Nathan Phillips was a Vietnam-era veteran and that he was spit on while in uniform as opposed to when he was returning from combat.\u201d  Did Phillips explicitly say he suffered such indignities while returning to the U.S. from Vietnam, or did the writer mistakenly assume that from something less specific that Phillips said to him?Another  article from January 2019 about Phillips stated that he \u201cjoined the Marines and served as an infantryman in the Vietnam War,\u201d but that reference was soon excised from the article (without a correction notice).    Again, did Phillips explicitly tell the writer he was \u201can infantryman in the Vietnam War,\u201d or was that yet another misunderstanding of something Phillips (or someone else) said?It\u2019s difficult to determine at this point whether Phillips has deliberately misrepresented the nature of his service, whether he has been so vague and ambiguous in many of his descriptions (unintentionally or otherwise) that misinterpretations have entered his narrative, or whether he has tried to be accurate but may have just occasionally slipped up in his many, many hours of conversation and sometimes neglected to include the qualifiers about his service that he has used in many other videos and press interviews. Nonetheless, at times it has certainly sounded as though Phillips was trying to foster the impression that he had both served during the Vietnam War and had been deployed to Vietnam at some point during his service, even if he didn\u2019t literally say so.We note that Veteran\u2019s Affairs (VA), for the purposes of determining eligibility for VA Pension benefits, considers the Vietnam era to be the period between 28 February 1961 to 7 May 1975 for those who served in Vietnam, and between 5 August 1964 and 7 May 1975 (a window during which Phillips\u2019 reported service falls) for those who served elsewhere.  The  noted that Phillips had \u201cspent four years in the Marine Corps Reserve and left in 1976 with the rank of private, or E-1, the Marines said in a statement providing his personal releasable information,\u201d but we haven\u2019t yet been obtained copies of Phillips\u2019 official service records to verify exactly when and where he might have served. (We note that an image purporting to be a copy of Phillips\u2019 DD Form 214 \u2014 Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty \u2014 has been circulated on social media, but that image has not yet been verified.)

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: One of the more unusual features of the U.S. political system is the Electoral College process by which the president of the United States is chosen. Rather than holding a single, nationwide election in which the winner is the candidate who receives more votes than any other, the U.S. essentially wages 51 separate elections on the same day (one in each state, plus the District of Columbia), nearly all of them on a winner-take-all basis, with each state\u2019s results weighted by its population.The Electoral College system has long been a contentious issue in American politics, especially so after 2016, when for the second time in five elections the winning candidate was not the one who received a plurality of the popular vote. Critics have called for its abolition (or modification) on the grounds that it\u2019s an 18th-century artifact that\u00a0disproportionately magnifies the voting power of residents of smaller-population states, while supporters maintain the current system is necessary to ensure that successful presidential candidates foster popular support that is broad and national in nature rather than being tightly clustered in a few key areas.An image macro popular on social media at the beginning of 2019 attempted to express that latter view, pointing out that the population of Los Angeles county alone \u2014 where residents voted for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over Republican candidate Donald Trump by well over a 3-1 margin in 2016 \u2014 is greater that the population of a number of states in the U.S.:Whether the U.S. \u201cneeds\u201d to keep the Electoral College is a subjective issue beyond the scope of this piece, but we can address a few of the factual issues related to this image macro.First of all, the ambiguous wording of the text accompanying the image (\u201cThat county has the same population as ALL of the blue sections\u201d) has been misinterpreted by many viewers to mean that more people reside in Los Angeles County (represented by the red dot) than in all of the states colored blue on the map . That is not the case. The text means that the population of Los Angeles County is greater than the population of all but a handful of individual states. (For example, more people live in L.A. County than in the entire state of Washington, and more people live in L.A. County than in the entire state of Oregon, but the populations of Washington and Oregon combined are still greater than that of L.A. County.)Second, population tallies are estimates, so the accuracy of the map\u2019s coloration is variable depending upon which source(s) are used for population figures. According to the most recent population estimates available from the U.S. Census Bureau for Los Angeles County (July 2017) and individual states, the populations of Georgia (10,519,475) and North Carolina (10,383,620) are slightly higher than that of Los Angeles County (10,163,507) so those two states should not be colored blue on the map seen above.All in all the image macro makes its point fairly, even if it could be improved with some slight adjustments.

If this were simply a case of \u201cliberally biased\u201d mainstream media outlets ignoring a positive story about President Trump, we would still expect coverage of this event to turn up in conservative-leaning news outlets. However, we found almost no information about this veteran\u2019s receiving a Purple Heart from President Trump in  news outlets, regardless of their perceived political leanings.The only article we could turn up was published in a Pennsylvania newspaper, the Titusville Herald, on 16 February 2019. That paper reported on the event not because of its national importance, but because of the pictured veteran\u2019s family ties to Saegertown, Penn.The report also contained an editor\u2019s note explaining that the veteran\u2019s surname was omitted due to a request for privacy: \u201c*Editor\u2019s note: There are two Clints referenced in this story. One, simply referred to as Clint, is Luke McGill\u2019s uncle, while the second is his father. The last names of Clint and his wife, Casey, have been omitted by request of the family for privacy.\u201dThe event began with President Trump\u2019s visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland in February 2019 for his annual physical. While there, the president met with a few of the wounded veterans who were being treated at that facility:The  also reported that President Trump\u2019s visit with Trial was unexpected, and that no members of the press were present at the meeting. In other words, President Trump didn\u2019t meet with this wounded veteran for a photo op or with the expectation of garnering positive news coverage.The newspaper also reported that the photographs were taken by a White House photographer (not a press photographer) and were privately provided to the family as keepsakes:We haven\u2019t been able to track down the initial internet origins of this image, but it seems likely that the photograph was lifted from one of the personal social media pages of Trial (whose Twitter account is now set to private) or those of one of his relatives, and then turned into a meme and shared (against his wishes for privacy) with his full name.This meme does not appear to demonstrate any news media \u201cbias\u201d against President Trump but rather a private interaction that was never meant to receive press attention. President Trump didn\u2019t meet with this veteran for a photo opportunity, nor did the news media refuse to cover the event out of a desire to provide nothing but negative stories about the president. If anything, this meme seems to demonstrate that some social media users will exploit even wounded veterans in order to advance their own political viewpoints.A GoFundMe campaign to help Sgt.

In an 8 March 2019 press release, Vote16USA Campaign Manager Brandon Klugman declared, \u201cOnly a couple years ago, just one Member of Congress expressing interest in 16-year-old voting was a huge deal, so to see 126 members vote yes on Rep. Pressley\u2019s amendment is a thrilling sign of how far we\u2019ve come in a short time, and a testament to the fact that support for this issue consistently increases as decision makers are educated about it. We are excited to build on this momentum and we\u2019re optimistic that one day 16-year-old voting will be the norm in the United States.\u201dThough a movement is clearly afoot to lower the voting age for all citizens, activists told us it isn\u2019t about any particular politician or party.Pooja Patel, 18, of Chicago, and Vikiana Petit-Homme, 17, of Boston, are activists with Vote16USA, an initiative by the non-partisan, non-profit civic organization Generation Citizen. The two said the movement is aimed at including young people in the democratic process to ensure they become more active civically and have the ability to weigh in on policies that will affect them long into the future. They also said research indicates teens who are active civically also inspire older friends and relatives to get out the vote.Patel also said some research showed that civic engagement in young people started a lifelong pattern of remaining an active voter, and that the current generation of teenagers are extremely interested in politics. \u201cIt\u2019ll just cultivate generations and generations of people that are active in our democracy,\u201d she told us by phone. \u201cThere\u2019s no actual study or empirical data that support the claim young people will specifically vote for one party or another. At the same time, why would we want to disenfranchise people based on how we perceive they\u2019re going to vote?\u201d   (Some data do suggest younger voters tend to skew more Democratic and independent than Republican.)Legislative support for lowering federal voting age at the moment does come primarily from Democratic lawmakers, but it\u2019s not a \u201cnew scheme.\u201d  A bill to lower the voting age in Washington, D.C. to 16 for presidential elections was narrowly defeated in November 2018.

Two of them were lodged in the plastic handle covering, police said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking and it\u2019s kind of unsettling, to say the least, that someone would actually put that there or try to do that intentionally,\u201d Coloma Township Police Chief Wes Smigielski told local television news station WSBT.For years, hoaxes about HIV-infected needles tucked into places like the coin-return slots of pay phones and gas-station pump handles have circulated on the internet, as well as false claims that madmen were using such needles to prick unsuspecting moviegoers.However in May 2017, a California man was hospitalized after getting stuck by a needle lodged in a gas-pump handle.Hiding razor blades in places so that people might accidentally hurt themselves is a demented but familiar phenomenon. In 2012, a baby was treated for minor injuries after being cut by a razor blade hidden in her new footie pajamas. In 2014, a little boy also received minor injuries from razor blades maliciously taped to playground equipment in Illinois. In 2015, a North Dakota woman reported finding one embedded in the handle of a shopping cart.Every year, parents and children hear rumors of Halloween candy tainted with everything from razor blades to poison to drug. Oftentimes those reports are nothing more than hoaxes. Evaluate the following assertion: Razor blades were found in gas-pump handles in Michigan.

CBS News published an article with the headline \u201cAustralia is Trying to Kill Millions of Stray Cats by Airdropping Poisoned Sausages,\u201d which went on to report that:\u201cThe Australian government wants to kill two million feral cats by next year \u2014 and it wants to do it by airdropping poisonous sausages. There are currently an estimated 2 to 6 million free-roaming cats across the country, and officials say they are threatening native wildlife populations.\u201d\u00a0On 29 April, the UK  published an article with the headline \u201cAustralia Plans to Kill Millions of Feral Cats by Airdropping Sausages Laced With Poison\u201d and on 26 April CNN reported that:\u201cAustralia is at war \u2014 with feral cats. By 2020, the government wants to kill two million free roaming cats, a large chunk of the total feral cat population, which is estimated to be between 2 and 6 million.\u201dWe received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of these reports, and in particular about the claim that the primary or exclusive culling method was to be sausages laced with poison. The Australian government has indeed begun an initiative aimed at culling millions of feral cats, which they have described as \u201cone of the greatest threats to Australia\u2019s land-based mammals\u201d and blamed for driving some species into extinction.However, the culling project was first announced in 2015 and was already well underway when reports happened to emerge about it in April 2019.In 2015, Australia\u2019s government launched the Threatened Species Strategy. One of its four key strategies related to feral cats, and the policy outlined a target of culling 2 million such cats by the year 2020 and eradicating feral cats entirely from five of Australia\u2019s islands, among other goals. A government report launching the initiative stated that:\u201cThe scientific evidence is unequivocal that feral cats are one of the greatest threats to Australia\u2019s land-based mammals. They have been a major contributor to the extinction of at least 27 mammals since they were first introduced to Australia. Today, they imperil at least 142 species or more than one third of our threatened mammals, reptiles, frogs and birds. As an extinction driver for so many of our native animals, and a threat that has been relatively neglected in the past, tackling the threat of feral cats is the highest priority of this Action Plan.\u201dBy the end of 2016, researchers from RMIT University in Melbourne reported that an estimated 211,000 feral cats had been culled as part of the initiative, but also estimated that 83 percent of those animals had been shot, rather than poisoned. More up-to-date figures were not included in the progress report relating to the period ending in December 2017.\u00a0In order to achieve the goal of eradicating 2 million feral cats, the first action listed by the government was the \u201cdevelopment and deployment of Curiosity, the new humane feral cat bait.\u201d Australia\u2019s Department of Environment and Energy had spent years developing and testing Curiosity, a new form of sausage bait that, according to the government, is less likely than existing baits to be consumed by other animals:(Although the excerpt serves to explain the Australian government\u2019s reasoning in favoring the Curiosity bait, it does contain a factual error: cats  have molar teeth, albeit only two, and they are used for tearing flesh rather than grinding, so the overall claim that cats tend to chew less and swallow more readily than other animals, appears to stand).\u00a0In government-commissioned field trials of Curiosity, the bait has been distributed on the ground in target areas using both aircraft and ground vehicles.As of April 2019, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority was still assessing the PAPP variant of Curiosity. But the national government appeared confident it would be registered as a pest-control product, because in November 2018 the Department of the Environment and Energy solicited applications for a commercial partner to manufacture and sell the bait.Although no significant developments in relation to the culling program took place in the spring of 2019, interest in the initiative was revived by a 25 April article published by  , which bore the headline \u201cAustralia is Deadly Serious About Killing Millions of Cats,\u201d and mentioned the existing use of another kind of sausage-borne cat bait containing the active ingredient sodium fluoroacetate, known as \u201c1080.\u201d\u00a0In February 2019, a group of Australian scientists questioned the basis of the government\u2019s target of culling 2 million feral cats by 2020, in part saying the government had not given a clear metric or scientific rationale for that number; had failed to indicate how or whether the cull would lower the overall population of feral cats (given the rapid rates at which they reproduce) and also increase the populations of endangered species; and because estimates vary widely over how many feral cats actually live in Australia. In a paper published in the journal , the researchers wrote:\u201cThe focus on killing cats runs the risk of distracting attention away from other threats to biodiversity, most prominent of which is widespread, ongoing habitat loss, which has been largely overlooked in the Threatened Species Strategy. The culling target is a highly visible symbol of a broader campaign around feral cat research and management in Australia, rather than a direct indicator of conservation action and success. We are concerned that progress toward the 2 million target could be misinterpreted as progress toward conserving threatened species, when the link between the two is not clear.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: The Australian government's Threatened Species Strategy has as one of its aims the culling of 2 million feral cats by 2020, largely using a sausage bait carrying a lethal toxin.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In early 2019, the United States suffered its worst series of measles outbreaks since 1994. Between 1\u00a0January 2019 and 26\u00a0April 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 704 individual cases of measles had been confirmed in 22 states. \u201cThis is the greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1994 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000,\u201d the organization reported.Dubious websites and citation-free social media posts have attempted to suggest that these measles outbreaks are the result of immigrants who illegally crossed into the U.S. via the Southern border \u2014 a common but almost-always-false trope employed by those who oppose more open immigration policies. For example, pro-conspiracy, anti-vaccine website Natural News claimed on 28\u00a0April 2019 that, \u201cIt\u2019s the disease-ridden illegal aliens that are bringing infectious diseases into America\u201d in a story titled in part, \u201cThe Measles Outbreak is a Massive False Flag.\u201d That report cited a story from Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars that misrepresented a Fox News segment about a measles outbreak in New York.tweetedNo factual basis exists to support the claim that illegal immigrants are the cause of the increase in U.S. measles outbreaks. But multiple pieces of evidence do support the claim that unvaccinated people who have traveled to areas with high rates of measles and then returned to the U.S. are the cause of the uptick. As of 30\u00a0April 2019, measles outbreaks \u2014 defined by the CDC as three or more simultaneous cases in the same area \u2014 were identified in nine geographic areas:The epidemiology of many of these outbreaks has been researched by the CDC, which concluded that \u201cthese outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from other countries such as Israel, Ukraine, and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring.\u201dThe cases in New York State\u2019s Rockland County and New York City, for example, have been tied to an unvaccinated Orthodox Jewish child who picked up measles on a trip to Israel, and who then spread it among the largely unvaccinated community to which that child returned. As reported by New York City\u2019s Health website:This New York measles outbreak, comprising 423 of the 704 individual infections, represents the vast majority of cases that are part of this troubling resurgence of measles in 2019. It was caused not by illegal immigration across the Southern border, but by unvaccinated American citizens traveling abroad in Israel \u2014 a country that is currently having its own measles epidemic. Similarly, the outbreaks in California have been tied to four cases of people traveling abroad and returning to the United States:As argued in , \u201cHad these travelers and their families been vaccinated, we wouldn\u2019t have measles here. And when you couple the ease of opting out of vaccines with the fact that there\u2019s a greater global risk of catching measles elsewhere, it\u2019s not hard to see why the disease is now roaring back.\u201d Those who attempt to tie the rise to Southern-border-crossing immigrants do so by ignoring the epidemiological realities of a world that sees one billion people cross international borders every year, sometimes into and out of countries with low vaccination rates or ongoing outbreaks.Israel currently is experiencing a measles outbreak that vastly outpaces that experienced in the U.S. in 2019. As reported in the, Israel has seen diagnosed cases of measles \u201csoar from about 30 in the year 2017-2018 to almost 4,000 in the year 2018-2019.\u201d Ukraine, another country listed as a source of measles exposure to unvaccinated Americans, also is experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of measles. That country\u2019s acting minister of health told  that the rise is caused by \u201ca decade of corruption, war, a lack of political commitment to vaccination, and antivaccine sentiment.\u201d The Ukraine saw more than 15,000 cases and seven deaths in between 28\u00a0December 2018 and 1\u00a0February 2019.The Philippines, the third country indicated by the CDC as a source of contact for international travelers who could carry measles to the U.S., is also experiencing a massive outbreak. As of 26\u00a0February 2019, \u201cover 12,700 measles cases [were] officially reported by DOH [Department of Health] with 203 deaths from 1\u00a0January to 23\u00a0February 2019.\u201d According to that country\u2019s health department, \u201cthe Philippines has seen a decline in the first dose of measles vaccine in the past decade \u2014 from above 80% in 2008 to below 70% in 2017. Initial figures for 2018 indicate further decrease.\u201d For herd immunity to kick in and protect people from measles at a population level, the number of those vaccinated needs to approach 95%.Conversely, the countries of origin from which immigrants are attempting to cross the Southern border have comparatively high vaccination rates and are currently not experiencing large scale outbreaks of measles. As we reported in a 2018 iteration of this claim, many of the countries in Central America from which the migrants are attempting to flee have higher vaccination rates for measles than does the United States. In 2017, 92% of children aged 12-23 months were vaccinated for measles in the United States. In Mexico and Honduras, that figure was higher, at 96% and 97% respectively. El Salvador and Guatemala have seen a recent decline in vaccination rates, with 85% and 86% coverage in 2017 \u2014 the most recent year for which World Bank data is available.Claims that measles outbreaks in the U.S. are caused by Southern-border immigration are therefore wholly unsupported by factual evidence or hard data. To claim otherwise, one must ignore the actual data that links these measles outbreaks to specific unvaccinated Americans traveling abroad in measles-prone regions. For both of these reasons, the claim is false. Evaluate the following assertion: Immigrants who illegally crossed into the U.S. at the Mexico border are the cause of measles outbreaks in 2019 in the U.S. If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

In May 2019, we encountered a rumor claiming the opposite: that Trump\u2019s IQ was a lowly 73 (placing him in the \u201cwell below average\u201d classification).This rumor circulated in the form of an image that showed a purported newspaper clipping about the recent discovery of information regarding an IQ test Trump allegedly took during his first year at New York Military Academy (NYMA):However, this image was not, and did not reflect, a genuine newspaper clipping.While we aren\u2019t entirely sure where this story originated, we turned up no mention of it on any credible news website. In fact, we couldn\u2019t find the story published . The only version that appears to exist is the image version shown above.

However, what these unrelated images show is that the meme is nothing more than junk news aimed at disparaging President Trump.While Trump has chastised his political opponents for being what he called \u201clow-IQ individuals\u201d and has frequently boasted about having a high IQ himself, he has provided no documentation of his own IQ score.

In short, and according to Merriam-Webster, an Arabic numeral is \u201cany of the number symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\u201dSo people were a bit shocked when a screenshot showing the results of a survey question in which 56% of respondents said that schools in America shouldn\u2019t teach Arabic numerals circulated on social media in May 2019:Those were the results of a real survey question posed by the polling company Civic Science. John Dick, the Twitter user who originally posted a screenshot of the survey question, is the CEO of Civic Science.The full survey doesn\u2019t appear to be available at this time (we reached out to Civic Science for more information), but Dick has posted a few other questions from the poll, as well as some information regarding the purpose of the survey.Dick, who said that the \u201cgoal in this experiment was to tease out prejudice among those who didn\u2019t understand the question,\u201d shared another survey question about what should or shouldn\u2019t be taught in American schools.

In truth, however, Lemaitre\u2019s \u201ctheory of creation\u201d was an explanation for the expansion of the universe, now better known as the \u201cbig bang theory.\u201dDick\u2019s tweet about the Arabic numerals question was retweeted more than 20,000 times.

This claim seems to be based on two things: the fact that cinnamon twists  dry rotini pasta before they are cooked, and a basic lack of dough knowledge.To our surprise, the rumor that Taco Bell turns out cinnamon twists by deep-frying dry pasta (specifically the same boxed rotini available at most grocery stores) has actually been circulating online for more than a decade:We found multiple memes, images, articles, and videos all centered on this rumor. In 2006, for example, the blog \u201cSecret Recipes\u201d listed \u201cRotini Noodles\u201d as one of the main ingredients for Taco Bell\u2019s cinnamon twists, and in 2013  unveiled the \u201cmindblowing truth\u201d about cinnamon twists.The popular entertainment YouTube page \u201cBabbleTop\u201d spread this rumor through claiming in a video entitled \u201c10 Secrets Taco Bell Employees Will Never Tell You\u201d that \u201cCinnamon Twists [are] just rotini pasta that has been deep fried\u201d:Taco Bell\u2019s cinnamon twists are not made by deep-frying rotini, and you absolutely cannot make these treats at home by putting store-bought dried Italian pasta into a deep fryer.The only real \u201cevidence\u201d put forth to support this theory is that Taco Bell\u2019s cinnamon twists and rotini noodles  one another at first glance, as seen in a photograph supposedly showing cinnamon twists before and after they were cooked at Taco Bell was posted to the \u201cMildyInteresting\u201d section of Reddit in 2016. Although we have been unable to independently verify the following image, it does line up with comments from Taco Bell employees and other bits of media we\u2019ve encountered about the twists:While the pre-cooked cinnamon twists seen above may  rotini pasta, that does not mean the pictured food item  rotini pasta. This same logic can be applied to vodka and water, the explosive C4 and modeling clay, cake flour and powder sugar, or identical twins. While these things may resemble one another, they are clearly distinctly different items.In this case, we can simply take a look at the ingredient lists for Barilla\u2019s Rotini and Taco Bell\u2019s cinnamon twists to see that they are indeed two different products:: Wheat flour, yellow corn meal, rice flour, salt.\n: Semolina (wheat), Durum Wheat Flour.Those spreading this rumor seem to be unaware that a variety of doughs are used to create different types of food.  Pasta, cookies, pastries, cake, pizza, and pie are all made with \u201cdough,\u201d but nobody would mistake a bowl of spaghetti with a slice of pie.Taco Bell\u2019s cinnamon twists are akin to duros, a popular Mexican snack food commonly made by deep-frying wheat pellets. When those wheat pellets are cooked in oil, they puff up in a similar fashion to the cinnamon twists seen in the viral video:These treats go by several different names, including \u201cPasta para duros,\u201d which may have led to some of the confusion over Taco Bell\u2019s cinnamon twists. While we\u2019re not entirely sure about origins of this snack food\u2019s name, \u201cpasta para duros\u201d is not the same pasta you\u2019d find in a box of dry rotini:We found duros offered by a number of online sellers. While these wheat pellets are often sold in a \u201cwagon wheel\u201d shape, they also come in \u201ctwists\u201d that certainly resemble the Italian rotini pasta. Here\u2019s a before-and-after deep-frying photo from an eBay listing for Duros-Mexican Wheat Pellet Twists:The listed ingredients for these duros include wheat flour, corn flour, and rice flour, which is similar to the listed ingredients for Taco Bell\u2019s cinnamon twists.So what happens when you actually deep-fry rotini?YouTuber Joe Robbins attempted to make Taco Bell\u2019s cinnamon twists at home by deep-frying a variety of dried rotini pasta. When the store-bought dried pasta was deep-fried, it turned into a hard, hot, and ultimately inedible mess. At the end of the video, Robbins successfully made cinnamon twists by using ingredients he received from a Taco Bell employee:Taco Bell does not deep-fry rotini pasta in order to make their cinnamon twists. Similarly, home cooks cannot make cinnamon twists by putting store-bought dry Italian pasta into a deep fryer. While we can\u2019t detail exactly how Taco Bell makes their cinnamon twists, the restaurant chain\u2019s sugary snack is similar to the Mexican snack food duros, which are made by deep-frying wheat pellets.

But when a group of Somali kids of the same approximate age committed a vicious attack on innocent people with hammers they do not report a word of it.\u201dInfowars, the website headed by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, similarly reported that \u201cA group of 8-10 Somali teenagers armed with hammers attacked and injured several people at a rail station in Minnesota.\u201d On the \u201cAmerican Thinker\u201d website, Thomas Lifson described the incident as a \u201chorrific attack,\u201d and the \u201cRed State\u201d website also reported that a group of between eight and 10 Somali youths had attacked commuters with hammers, causing injuries.Several observers saw fit to connect the incident to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, based solely and exclusively on her Somali heritage. (None of the articles that connected her to the incident made mention of any of the neighborhood\u2019s  political representatives at the national, state or local levels.)The website StarPolitical.com wrote that \u201cFreshman Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar who has spent a great deal of time criticizing President Trump seems to have some problems in her home district \u2026\u201dSabia observed on TheFederalistPapers.org that \u201cThe attack also happened in the same district that Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali refugee, is from and she has said nothing on the attack,\u201d while Lifson wrote for AmericanThinker.com that \u201cSo far as I can determine, Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Somali refugee who represents Minneapolis in Congress and who also seems entirely ungrateful to the nation that paid for her to leave her hellhole homeland and granted her citizenship, has so far not commented on the incident.\u201dTownhall\u2019s Matt Vespa drew an even more direct link between Omar and the Minneapolis incident, claiming that both were examples of purported Somali immigrant ingratitude to the United States:\u201c[Red State\u2019s Elizabeth] Vaughn added this story was shared by Glenn Reynolds (aka Instapundit), who aptly noted this was just a case of Somali teens showing their gratitude to the nation who gave them refuge. Hey, this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who represents Minneapolis, is probably one of the most ungrateful people we\u2019ve ever offered refuge \u2026\u201dIn reality, the entire episode provided a warning about the dangers of using unconfirmed, uncorroborated preliminary information as the basis of news reports and opinion pieces, something that the much-criticized \u201cmainstream media\u201d (despite its flaws) tends not to do, and rightly did not do in this case.According to University of Minnesota police, the incident involved no assault and no injuries, although the actions of the perpetrators likely caused concern to bystanders. The arresting officers\u2019 report on the matter explicitly stated that racial bias played no part in the actions of the two juveniles, who were of Somali heritage and were ultimately cited for disorderly conduct and other misdemeanor offenses. The two boys carried two pipes, not hammers.Snopes.com obtained a copy of the redacted University of Minnesota (UMN) Police Department report on the incident, which outlines the following information.Around 9.45 p.m. on Saturday 17 May, UMN police officers were dispatched to the East Bank train station on Washington Avenue Southeast, next to the University of Minnesota, after receiving reports of a group of Somali youths with weapons. One of the arresting officers, Amanda Carlson, gave the following account. Redactions are signified with \u201c(R).\u201d\u201cUpon arrival to the East Bank LRT I saw a group of Somali juveniles running away from officers traveling westbound on Washington Ave SE and turn southbound between Moos Tower and [the] Molecular and Cellular Biology building. I ran after them and heard officers yelling at the juveniles to stop. I turned onto Delaware St SE where officers had several Somali juveniles lying prone with their arms spread out. I placed a male, later identified as (R) in handcuffs and performed a search incident to arrest. All other parties were placed in handcuffs and detained by other officers that had arrived on scene.\u201dThe first juvenile, detained by Carlson, provided what turned out to be a false name and date of birth.Carlson continued: \u201cThrough further investigation, it was found that (R) and (R) were the two individuals brandishing metal pipes towards others on the light rail platform. Dispatch sent recorded images of the incident on the East Bank LTR which showed (R) holding a metal pipe and handing it to (R). (R) and (R) were placed in the rear of a squad car and transported to UMPD by Officer Brackett.\u201cAll other parties that had fled on foot and were detained were ultimately released from police custody at the scene. I issued a citation to (R) for disorderly conduct as he engaged in offensive, abusive, boisterous and noisy conduct tending to arouse alarm, flee police as he attempted to evade or elude peace officers, who were acting in the lawful discharge of official duty, by means of running, and false information to police as he provided a fictitious name and false date of birth.\u201dCarlson wrote that two metal pipes were taken from the two young men who received the citations.The second arresting officer, Matthew Williams, provided a similar account of the incident, one in which he pursued the group of youths, repeatedly shouting after them \u201cPolice, stop.\u201d When they eventually stopped running, Williams told them to lie on their stomachs on the ground, with \u201ctheir arms extended out to their sides.\u201d He continued:\u201cI aired to dispatch I had nine people proned out on the ground \u2026 As other officers began arriving at the turnaround I performed a more accurate count of the number of individuals laying on the ground and observed there to be seven Somali males lying on the ground. I aired this updated information to dispatch that there were seven people proned out on the ground. I was standing over two of the males and had observed the five other people had been placed in handcuffs. I then placed handcuffs on each of the two males I was standing over and informed both of them they were under arrest for fleeing from police on foot \u2026 Once all seven males had been placed in handcuffs, officers began identifying the seven Somali males and further investigation began to determine who had been brandishing weapons on the light rail platform \u2026\u201dIn the end, UMN police cited two juvenile males on suspicion of disorderly conduct and fleeing a police officer on foot. One of the two was also cited on suspicion of providing a police officer with a false name. All of the alleged crimes are misdemeanors. The investigation is closed.Contrary to the aforementioned claims of a \u201cvicious attack,\u201d \u201chorrific attack,\u201d and \u201cgang assault,\u201d the redacted police report only described the two cited youths as \u201cbrandishing\u201d and \u201ccarrying\u201d two pipes, and did not mention any assault or attack by any of the youths. Although the incident was likely concerning and unpleasant for bystanders, a UMN spokesperson confirmed to Snopes that, \u201cThere were no known injuries as a result of this incident.\u201dThe two individuals who were cited were identified as having carried the pipes because police had security camera footage from the train station. Despite the availability of such video footage, none of the youths was charged or cited with any assault offenses.The claim of an \u201cattack\u201d resulting in injuries appears to have originated in a police dispatch call that was shared by the website Alpha News. In the audio, which can be heard here, a police dispatcher states:\u201c[UMN Police Department] is asking for assistance from Metro Transit [Police] and Minneapolis [Police] for a group of eight to 10 males at the East Bank light rail station chasing people around with hammers. They do have some people injured. They\u2019re sending us more information, but they\u2019re requesting assistance.\u201dSo the claims of an attack with hammers causing injuries were not fabricated, but they were based on initial, unconfirmed reports taken from online police scanners. Such preliminary details are undoubtedly of interest, but they should never be assumed to be accurate. In the case of the 17 May East Bank incident, those initial reports did indeed turn out to be inaccurate, as evidenced by the report filed by the arresting officers.Likewise, the claim that the actions of the youths \u2014 which we now know did not involve any actual physical assault \u2014 were \u201cracially motivated\u201d appears to have been based on a single uncorroborated account posted to Facebook by an individual named as \u201cJay Hall,\u201d who claimed to have witnessed the incident and wrote \u201c\u2026 It was a group of Somali young males with hammers and bars. They were attacking anyone who looked like they had money or were white\u201d:That single uncorroborated account, from a person whose presence at the incident could not be confirmed, appears to have been the basis of claims that the incident was \u201cracially motivated,\u201d such as the assertion made by Townhall.com\u2019s Matt Vespa, who wrote: \u201cIt looks like it was racially motivated. According to reports, anyone who was white or looked like they had money was targeted.\u201dIn reality, the official UMN police report explicitly noted that \u201cno bias\u201d was involved in any of the actions of the boys who were cited, a term used to indicate whether a criminal offense was motivated by one of several types of prejudice and could result in additional hate crime charges. That was not the case here, according to the official police report. We asked Jay Hall whether he had any evidence that might support his characterization of the incident, such as video footage or photographs, and he told us he did not. Evaluate the following assertion: A group of Somali teenagers used hammers to physically attack and injure several passersby at a train station in Minneapolis in May 2019.

It also prohibits donors from making campaign contributions in anyone else\u2019s name. The defendants stand accused of conspiring to do both, as well as making false statements to the Federal Election Commission (FEC).A DOJ press release enumerated the charges:Although the recipient(s) of the illegal contributions weren\u2019t named in the indictment, it was clear from the context that they were campaign committees working on behalf of the re-election of President Barack Obama (referred to in the document as \u201cCandidate A\u201d). The object of the conspiracy, according to the DOJ, was \u201cto gain access to, and potential influence with, Candidate A and his administration.\u201dMainstream news media coverage of the indictment focused on the alleged conspirators and the details of their plot to defraud the Obama campaign and the FEC. Despite the fact that no one in the campaign was implicated in the conspiracy or charged with crimes, a decidedly different narrative emerged on an assortment of right-leaning, pro-Trump websites and social media accounts. An 11 May 2019 article on Intellihub.com, for example, bore the headline \u201cHow Barack Obama received $21.6M in illegally funneled foreign campaign contributions and stole the presidency.\u201d\u201cAccording to reports circulating at the highest levels in Washington,\u201d the article said, \u201cformer U.S. President Barack H. Obama\u2019s political campaign received at least $21.6 million in illegal foreign campaign contributions during the run-up to the 2012 presidential election.\u201dThe sentence was subsequently quoted in an editorial published on at least a half-dozen other hyperpartisan blogs and websites with headlines falsely claiming that a \u201cmedia blackout\u201d was in place regarding the indictment. A significant chunk of the editorial was devoted to the text of what was described as \u201cthe DOJ Report, in full\u201d \u2014 although, in point of fact, what was referenced was only the DOJ press release, which distilled the 20-page document down to just a few paragraphs. The author of the piece then posed (and presumed to answer) these rhetorical questions:The same propagandistic strategy was employed by pro-Trump social media users. This example was tweeted on 15 May:These claims are factually erroneous and logically invalid, on these three grounds:First, the Obama campaign did not receive all $21.6 million of the foreign funds the DOJ says Jho transferred to Michel for that purpose, or anywhere near that amount. Both the indictment and the DOJ\u2019s press release said the actual amount funneled to the campaign totaled approximately $1.87 million:\u201cTo facilitate the excessive contributions and conceal their true source, Michel paid approximately $865,000 of the money received from Low to about 20 straw donors, or conduits, so that the straw donors could make donations in their names to a presidential joint fundraising committee. In addition, Michel personally directed more than $1 million of the money received from Low to an independent expenditure committee also involved in the presidential election in 2012.\u201d (DOJ press release)Second, as we stated before, nowhere in the indictment was Obama or any entity involved in the campaign implicated in the conspiracy or charged with a crime. The indictment stated multiple times that the defendants went to elaborate lengths to hide what they were doing, not only from the FEC but from the campaign itself. Committees connected with the campaign  accepted the foreign donations via a series of shell bank accounts and straw donors set up by Michel and Jho to disguise the true source of the funds.Page 2 of the indictment states:\u201cThe defendants concealed the scheme from the candidate, the candidate\u2019s campaign and administration, federal regulators, and the public by secretly funneling foreign money from JHO LOW through a series of straw donors (also known as \u201cconduits\u201d or \u201cstraw contributors\u201d) who purported to make legal campaign contributions in their own names, rather than in the names of the true source of the funds. MICHEL concealed the conspiracy by making and causing false statements to be made to the FEC. \u201dPage 8 of the indictment states:\u201cMICHEL, Company E, and the straw donors made contributions to Political Committees A and B in their own names, rather than the name of JHO LOW, thus concealing the true source of the contributions. As a result, MICHEL caused Political Committees A and B to make false entries in multiple campaign contribution reports submitted to the FEC about the true source of the contributions. To further conceal the true source of the contributions, and to maintain his appearance as a high dollar fundraiser for Candidate A, MICHEL made false entries in a declaration he submitted to the FEC claiming that he was the source of the contributions to Political Committee B.\u201dLast, the supposition that these illegal contributions enabled Obama to win (or \u201csteal\u201d) the election is absurd, considering that the campaign raised (and spent) roughly $722 million in total, of which the actual donations Jho and Michel managed to funnel to the committees amounted to about one-quarter of one percent (0.25%).

The study\u2019s authors noted that males were 5.48 times more likely than females to have an enlarged EOP and included a graph that appeared to show younger people between the ages of 18 and 29 years having a much higher prevalence of enlarged EOP than people between the ages of 30 and 50 years.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: On June 30, 2019, the conservative commentary site Daily Wire (along with several other news outlets) ran a story with an entirely factual headline: \u201cCity In Ilhan Omar\u2019s Congressional District Votes To Eliminate Pledge Of Allegiance For Meetings.\u201d The city in question was St. Louis Park. That city is, as well-documented in Daily Wire\u2019s reporting, located in Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District. And that district is indeed represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Ilhan Omar, an immigrant from Somalia and one of the few Muslims serving in Congress.\nOmar, whose name is often invoked for the purpose of fomenting Islamophobic fear mongering, had nothing to do with this decision. That decision was made by five individuals who are not Ilhan Omar, as described in local news report from June 26:\n\u201cIn order to create a more welcoming environment to a diverse community, we are going to forgo saying the Pledge of Allegiance before every meeting,\u201d said Council Member Tim Brausen. At the meeting, Brausen said members might recite it in the future if there\u2019s an appropriate opportunity, like if Boy Scouts are there. \u2026 The change was approved unanimously by city council in a 5 to 0 vote. It will take effect on July 15.\nStill, Daily Wire\u2019s social media postings misleadingly combined Omar\u2019s name and face with a quote from someone (St. Louis Park Ward 2 council member Anne Mavity) who is not Omar:\n\nThis led many readers and social media users to accuse Omar of disrespecting America, at times producing not-so-veiled threats against her life on Daily Wire\u2019s own Facebook page:\n\nAs accurately stated in these articles, five city council members in St Louis Park voted to stop saying the pledge of allegiance before most city council meetings. None of those people, despite gratuitous use of her name and image in social media and in headlines, was Ilhan Omar. Evaluate the following assertion: A city in U.S. Rep.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In July 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump prompted an outraged response, primarily from those within the Democratic party but also from some of his fellow Republicans, when he targeted \u201cprogressive Democrat Congresswomen\u201d of recent immigrant heritage, suggesting they should \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came, then come back and show us how it is done.\u201d\nIt was widely understood that Trump\u2019s tweets were a reference to a group of four members of Congress \u2014 U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (New York), Ilhan Omar (Minnesota), Rashida Tlaib (Michigan) and Ayanna Pressley (Massachussetts.) The fact that all four women are U.S. citizens and only one (Omar) was born outside the country prompted widespread\u00a0criticism\u00a0of Trump\u2019s remarks as racist and xenophobic.\nOn July 15, CNN presenter Jake Tapper suggested a measure of hypocrisy or short-sightedness on the president\u2019s part might also exist, since First Lady Melania Trump was herself originally an immigrant to the United States, and had, according to Tapper, been a U.S. citizen for less time than Omar. Tapper said Omar \u201chas been a U.S. citizen since she was a teenager \u2014 longer than the First Lady.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\nWe received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of Tapper\u2019s claim that Omar became a naturalized U.S. citizen before Melania Trump did.\n\nNo substantive public dispute exists over widely repeated claims that Omar became a U.S. citizen in 2000, and Melania Trump in 2006, a sequence of events that would vindicate Tapper\u2019s claim. However, official documentation is not publicly available that would confirm that timeline, and representatives for each woman did not provide such evidence when requested. Until such evidence becomes available, we are issuing a rating of \u201cUnproven.\u201d\nTrump was born Melanija Kravs, in Slovenia, in April 1970. She worked as a model in Europe before moving to the United States in the mid-1990s. She became a permanent resident in March 2001, according to the Associated Press, then married the future president in Florida in January 2005.\nAccording to the First Lady\u2019s account, she became a citizen of the United States on July 28, 2006. Shannon Donnelly, a Palm Beach, Florida, society columnist, reported two days later that she had \u201ctaken the oath of citizenship\u201d and was \u201cnow an American.\u201d\u00a0\nIn her 2016 Republican National Convention speech, Trump described becoming a U.S. citizen as \u201cthe greatest privilege on planet earth\u201d:\n\u00a0\ufeff\nDespite this evidence, and despite the fact that we found no substantive dispute over the date of Trump\u2019s naturalization, we found no official documentation or correspondence regarding it, so we cannot definitively confirm that it took place in 2006. The White House did not respond to our request for such official evidence.\u00a0\nOmar was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, in October 1982. According to the biography posted on her own website, she lived there for around eight years before her family fled to a refugee camp in Kenya, moving to the United States four years later, and eventually settling in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis in 1997.\u00a0\nIn a 2018 interview with the Intercept website\u2019s \u201cDeconstructed\u201d podcast, Omar said she became a naturalized U.S. citizen before she turned 18 years old, explaining that, \u201cMy father became a citizen and so I got my citizenship through that process.\u201d\nIn the same interview, she said her family resettled in the U.S. in 1995. Since a would-be naturalized citizen must first live in the U.S. as a permanent resident for five years, 2000 would be the earliest year in which Omar\u2019s father (and Omar herself) could become citizens. Since Omar was born in October 1982, she turned 18 in October 2000. So, based on the sequence of events presented by Omar, it appears she became a U.S. citizen at the age of 17, some time between January and October 2000 \u2014 roughly six years before Melania Trump, by her own account, became a U.S. citizen.\nAlthough Omar\u2019s account makes sense, and we found no substantive dispute over it, we were unable to locate any official documentation that supports that version of events. We asked Omar\u2019s spokesperson and district director to provide any official documentation that would confirm the date of her naturalization, but we received no such evidence.\nThe Congresswoman\u2019s spokesperson reiterated that she became a U.S. citizen in 2000, and pointed out that an individual cannot be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives without demonstrating citizenship, but the spokesperson did not have Omar\u2019s \u201cpersonal government documents.\u201d\nUntil and unless evidence of that nature becomes available to us, definitively establishing that Omar became a U.S. citizen in 2000 and Trump in 2006, the claim of this fact-check remains unproven, though likely to be true.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: U.S. Rep.

Her mother and father, both natives of Slovenia, followed her in applying for and receiving citizenship in 2018.\nThose basic facts formed the basis of an\u00a0article published in July 2019 by the website Taters Gonna Tate, which is part of a network of sites and social media accounts that distribute online content under the brand America\u2019s Last Line of Defense (LLOD). Entitled \u201cAOC Starts \u2018Chain Migration\u2019 Proceedings Against Melania Trump,\u201d the article proceeds from the premise that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), one of the members of Congress singled out by Trump, wants to use one of Trump\u2019s own immigration bugaboos, so-called \u201cchain migration,\u201d to deport the first lady and her parents:\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez has sworn to now begin delivering on the promise that got her elected \u2013 to have First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s parents deported through Trump\u2019s own laws against chain migration, adding that the subject of exiling Melania herself and offspring, Barron, would wait until \u201cAfter Oompah-Loompah leaves the White House because it\u2019s bad optics right now.\u201d\nAOC claims that President Trump\u2019s own legal adjustment on the subject of chain migration should nullify the legal status of Oedipus and Jezebel Beelzebub, Melania\u2019s parents. She suggests that the only reason the two were granted citizenship was because of the status Melania received after her now celebrated Green Card wedding to our president. This is simply not true.\nFor context, \u201cchain migration\u201d is a term used to describe immigration procedures that allow adult U.S. citizens to obtain citizenship for foreign-born adult relatives. Reportedly, the first lady\u2019s parents secured their citizenship through just such a procedure \u2014 though we needn\u2019t belabor the point, because everything else in the story is fictional (Melania Trump\u2019s parents aren\u2019t named \u201cOedipus and Jezebel Beelzebub,\u201d for example).\u00a0\nLike the rest of the entities comprising LLOD, Taters Gonna Tate mimics a news format but publishes only fabricated content calculated to generate controversy and attract social media likes and shares.

By the time the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center came down weeks later, Rogers\u2019 time in the neighborhood had already come to an end.\u00a0\nWhile Rogers was enjoying retirement from being an entertainer, he was still involved with the Fred Rogers Production Company. Producers urged him to film a series of promos to address the terrorist attacks, but Rogers had doubts about the idea:\nHowever, the tragic events of September 11 shook Rogers\u2019 world. He\u2019d long been a part-time resident of New York City, where he\u2019d purchased an apartment so he\u2019d have a place to stay when visiting for work. He was also a native of Pennsylvania, where Flight 93 crashed after passengers tried to regain control of the hijacked plane. And Rogers was particularly affected by the fact that these terrorist attacks contradicted the messages of neighborliness and kindness he\u2019d spent decades trying to convey.\nAccording to Fred Rogers Productions, the above-displayed video shows the last message Rogers recorded at WQED studios: \u201cThis short video aired on PBS five months before Fred Rogers died. It turned out to be the last time he would record at WQED studios, where, for decades, he had created and filmed \u2018Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood.'\u201d\nAn official copy of this video available via Fred Rogers Production\u2019s Vimeo page is entitled \u201cFred Rogers\u2019 Message to those who grew up with the Neighborhood.\u201d The Vimeo page notes that this clip \u201caired on PBS to mark the one-year anniversary of 9/11.\u201d\u00a0\nThe full clip is available via PBS Kids:\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only video Rogers filmed during this session. The Associated Press reported in 2002 that Rogers filmed four promos for the first anniversary of the 9/11 attacks:\nFred Rogers 9/11 Fri, Sep 6, 2002 \u2013 6 \u00b7 The Sentinel (Carlisle, Pennsylvania) \u00b7 Newspapers.com\nIn another clip entitled \u201cHelping Children Deal with Tragic Events in the News,\u201d Rogers gave his thoughts on how adults can best communicate with their children about traumatic news stories. That video also is viewable on the Fred Rogers Productions\u2019 Vimeo page. We\u2019ve transcribed Rogers\u2019 message below:\nHello. I\u2019m Fred Rogers. Some parents wonder how to handle world news with their young children. Well we at family communications have discovered that when children bring up something frightening it\u2019s helpful right away to ask them what they know about it. We often find that their fantasies are very different than the actual truth. What children probably need to hear most from us adults, is that they can talk with us about anything. And that we will do all we can to keep them safe in any scary time. I\u2019m always glad to be your neighbor.\u00a0\nBiography.com points to one other clip from these post-9/11 promos. We have not been able to find a copy of this video, but Biography provided the following description:\n\u201cNo matter what our particular job, especially in our world today, we all are called to be \u2018tikkun olam,\u2019 repairers of creation.\u201d The Hebrew words \u201ctikkun olam\u201d refer to actions taken to improve society, including caring for others, which was useful advice for a devastated nation. The phrase \u201ctikkun olam\u201d also reflected Rogers\u2019 ecumenical bent \u2014 though he was an ordained Presbyterian minister, he\u2019d always been open to and interested in different faith traditions and philosophies.\nIn the same video spot, Rogers also said, \u201cThank you for whatever you do, wherever you are, to bring joy and light and hope and faith and pardon and love to your neighbor and to yourself.\u201d Rogers had always wanted a world that would be guided by understanding and love instead of being blinded by fear and hate. His words demonstrated that the attacks hadn\u2019t destroyed his faith in neighborliness, and provided a vision for how to move forward in a different world.\nWhile we\u2019re not entirely certain about its timing, the following video from PBS Kids appears to show one last clip from this session.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In the aftermath of a deadly mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, in August 2019, some online observers claimed to have unearthed evidence that the official public narrative surrounding the suspected gunman, Connor Betts, was sorely incomplete. Betts, according to some, had actually died in 2014.\u00a0\nThose who advanced and promulgated this conspiracy theory (the exact nature of which was unclear) pointed to a February 2014 obituary for a man by the name of Connor Betts of Suffield, Connecticut. Some even speculated that Betts\u2019 death had been staged in 2014, and that he had since entered a witness-protection program from which he emerged in August 2019 to perpetrate a mass shooting.\u00a0\nAccording to proponents of the \u201c2014 death\u201d theory, three similarities connect the Connor Betts who died in Connecticut in 2014 and the one Dayton police named as the suspected gunman in a mass shooting during the early hours of Aug. 4, 2019, and whom police fatally shot at that time:\nThese similarities, the theory goes, can only be explained or can best be explained by an elaborate plot of some kind, whether it involved a faked death in 2014, the suspected Dayton shooter assuming an existing identity, or some other conspiracy.\u00a0\nThe obituary cited by those promoting the conspiracy theory marked the tragic death of Connor D. Betts, a young man from Suffield, Connecticut who had just turned 22 when he was killed in an accident while working for a local construction company on Feb. 19, 2014.\nHowever, the man named by Dayton police as the suspect in the August 2019 mass shooting was Connor Stephen Betts \u2014 a different person with a different middle name. Connor S. Betts, the suspected shooter, was listed on electoral rolls as having a birth year of 1994 (which comports with Dayton police\u2019s confirmation that his age was 24), and was registered to vote in Greene County, Ohio, and took part in elections there since 2012 \u2014 that is, both before and after the death of Connor D. Betts in Connecticut in 2014.\u00a0\nConnor D. Betts and Connor S. Betts did each have a sister named Megan, however they are also two separate individuals. According to Dayton police, Megan Betts was 22 years old when she was shot to death during the Aug. 4 massacre of which her brother is suspected. On the Greene County, Ohio, voter rolls, she was listed as having been born in 1997 and residing at the same address as Connor S. Betts, her brother and the Dayton shooting suspect. Her full name was listed as Megan Kathleen Betts.\u00a0\nBy contrast, we have cross-referenced news archives and court records and confirmed that the full name of Connor D. Betts\u2019 sister is highly likely to be Megan B. Betts, and that she was highly likely to have been born in 1986, not 1997. Each Megan Betts is or was a completely different person, separated by more than a decade in age, and bearing little or no physical resemblance to one another.\u00a0\nThe third plank of the conspiracy theories was the claim that Connor D. Betts and Connor S. Betts had the same physical appearance, meaning they must have been the same person. Setting aside the fact that Connor D. Betts did in fact die in 2014, and\u00a0any claims to the contrary were liable to be deeply hurtful to his loved ones, the two men did not look the same.\u00a0\nAt first glance, some photographs showed a certain passing resemblance between them, but a closer examination revealed that any similarities were no more than superficial. A photographic tribute to Connor D. Betts, posted shortly after his death in 2014, contained dozens of photographs of him. The full scope of those photographs demonstrates clearly that he and Connor S. Betts were completely different individuals.\u00a0\nAt first glance, the coincidences involved in this conspiracy theory might appear impossibly unlikely to some observers, giving rise to the conclusion that \u201csomething else\u201d must surely be afoot. In reality, they are not so unlikely at all.\nAccording to Social Security Administration (SSA) data, \u201cConnor\u201d was the 48th most popular boy\u2019s name in Connecticut in 1992 (the year in which Connor D. Betts was born). In 1986, the year in which Megan B. Betts was born, \u201cMegan\u201d was the 22nd most popular girl\u2019s name in the state. There are therefore lots of Connors and lots of Megans in the state of Connecticut, and the possibility of finding two siblings with those names and respective ages, is much greater than it otherwise would be, due to the popularity of those first names.\u00a0\nIt is also not that unlikely to find the same brother-sister name pairing replicated in another state, in this case Ohio. The same SSA data shows that \u201cConnor\u201d was the 63rd most popular boy\u2019s name in Ohio in 1994, the year of Connor Stephen Betts\u2019 birth, and \u201cMegan\u201d was the ninth most popular girl\u2019s name in the state in 1997, the year in which Megan Kathleen Betts was born. Plenty of Connors, even more Megans, live in that state, so a reasonable possibility exists of finding a brother and sister with those names and a two or three-year age gap between them.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: The Dayton, Ohio, mass shooting suspect \"Connor Betts\" is or has assumed the identity of the same Connor Betts who died in Connecticut in 2014.

I\u2019m the chosen one\u201d along with an unattributed quotation that read: \u201cThe Anti-christ will pretend that he is the son of God.\u201d (That quotation is not Biblical in origin, and appears to have originated in a famous medieval text about the antichrist, written by the French Benedictine monk Adso of Montier-en-der.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThe same Facebook page posted a second meme on similar themes, writing:\nToday, Trump:\nPromoted the idea that he is \u201cKing of Israel.\u201d\nRetweeted that he\u2019s \u201cthe second coming of God.\u201d\nThen said he\u2019s \u201cthe chosen one.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd in a third post on the same subject, Occupy Democrats published a meme that read: \u201cTrump says he\u2019s \u2018the second coming\u2019 and \u2018the chosen one.\u2019 I say we throw him in the sea to see if he can walk on it.\u201d\nOther mostly left-leaning sources posted similar claims on Twitter, garnering a high volume of retweets. One of them wrote:\n\u201cWhen the president of the United States starts declaring that he is:\n\u2013 \u2018The King of Israel\u2019\n\u2013 \u2018The Chosen One\u2019\n\u2013 \u2018The Second coming of God\u2019\nIt means he is out of his goddamn mind & it\u2019s time for the 25th amendment now.\u201d\nWhen the president of the United States starts declaring that he is:\n\u2014 \u201cThe King of Israel\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cThe Chosen One\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cThe Second coming of God\u201d\nIt means he is out of his goddamn mind & it\u2019s time for the #25thAmendmentNow.\n\u2014 Ryan Knight \ud83d\uddfd (@ProudResister) August 21, 2019\n\u00a0\nThe @BarristerSecret account tweeted that Trump had \u201cunironically [declared] himself \u2018the second coming of God,'\u201d and the controversial surgeon and left-leaning activist Dr. Eugene Gu claimed the president had \u201c[praised] himself as \u2018the King of Israel\u2019 and \u2018the second coming of God.'\u201d\u00a0\nVanity Fair also published an article with the headline \u201cTrump Declares Himself \u2018King of Israel,\u2019 \u2018the Second Coming of God.'\u201d\nThe reality was much more complicated, and the claims and reports mentioned above largely misrepresented what Trump actually said or wrote by removing them from their proper context or issuing inaccurate descriptions of them.\u00a0\n\u2018The chosen one\u2019\nWhile speaking with reporters about the ongoing U.S. trade war with China, Trump did briefly say \u201cI am the chosen one,\u201d but it\u2019s quite possible, even likely, that he was merely speaking tongue-in-cheek or for rhetorical effect.\u00a0\nHis remarks came on Aug. 21, while he was speaking with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. In response to a question about recent talk of an impending economic recession, linked to the U.S.-China trade war, Trump held forth on what he presented as sharp economic practices by China, a common topic of discussion for the president. He said:\n\u201cOne thing I have to do is economically take on China because China has been ripping us off for many years. President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama and others should have done this long before me. My life would be much easier \u2014 although I enjoy doing it \u2014 but my life would be much easier if I just said \u2018let China continue to rip off the United States.\u2019 It would be much easier, but I can\u2019t do that \u2026\n\u201c\u2026 Somebody said \u2018It\u2019s Trump\u2019s trade war\u2019 \u2014 this isn\u2019t my trade war, this is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago, by a lot of other presidents \u2026 Somebody had to do it. [Turning to the sky] I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it, so I\u2019m taking on China. I\u2019m taking on China on trade, and you know what? We\u2019re winning \u2026\u201d\nPresident Trump: \u201cI am the chosen one.\u201d\nFull video here: https://t.co/BEh8qCGe79 pic.twitter.com/6pbll1a0NT\n\u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) August 21, 2019\n\u00a0\nThe concept of a \u201cchosen one\u201d \u2014 an individual predestined by prophecy to perform the role of a savior or messiah for a particular people \u2014 has roots in various cultures and religious traditions, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. However, it has evolved beyond those parameters to gain much looser and more secular connotations.\nIt is a common trope in fiction and literature, especially science fiction and fantasy (think of Harry Potter), and is also frequently invoked, sometimes with tongue in cheek, in the context of sports. For example, the basketball player LeBron James famously had \u201cChosen 1\u201d tattooed on his back, after Sports Illustrated published a cover story about him, describing the then-phenomenally promising high school junior as \u201cthe chosen one.\u201d\nIn theory, Trump could have been seriously declaring a sincere belief that he is destined by prophecy to be the savior of the American people, or indeed the world, when he said as an aside \u201cI am the chosen one,\u201d during a discussion with reporters about U.S.-China economic relations. However, it seems much more likely to us, especially in light of his somewhat theatrical glance to the skies, that he was either using the phrase as a figure of speech born out of his apparently rather certain belief in his own talents, or that he was simply speaking with tongue firmly in cheek, or a little bit of both.\u00a0\nIf the U.S. president refers to himself as \u201cthe chosen one\u201d again, and with less ambiguous, more clearly messianic connotations, we will update this article accordingly.\n\u2018The King of Israel\u2019 and \u2018the second coming of God\u2019\nTrump never declared or called or described himself as \u201cthe King of Israel\u201d or \u201cthe second coming of God.\u201d Further, he did not even quote someone who personally professed that belief, and the person he did quote was not even claiming that others held that belief. As such, many sources, including those mentioned above, grossly misrepresented the pronouncements made in this episode.\nHowever, in a decision that concerned many observers, the president did directly quote the conspiracy theorist and radio host Wayne Allyn Root as saying that \u201cThe Jewish people in Israel love [Trump] like he\u2019s the King of Israel\u201d and \u201clike he is the second coming of God.\u201d Trump did this in a series of tweets, also on Aug. 21, which he prefaced by writing \u201cThank you Wayne Allyn Root for the very nice words\u201d:\u00a0\n\u2026. like he\u2019s the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God \u2026 But American Jews don\u2019t know him or like him. They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re doing or saying anymore. It makes no sense! But that\u2019s OK, if he keeps doing what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s good for \u2026..\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019\n\u00a0\nTrump almost entirely accurately quoted remarks Root made on his \u201cNewsmax\u201d TV show on Aug. 20. In response to a caller who lamented the purported irrationality and blind loyalty of Democrat voters, Root held forth on the traditional support for the Democrat party among Jewish voters in the U.S., in contrast with what he presented as widespread support for Trump among Jews in Israel. He said:\n\u201c\u2026 75 percent of all Jews vote Democrat and they don\u2019t like Trump. And this is the greatest president for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America. Trump\u2019s the best president for Israel in the history of the world. And the Jewish people love him like he is the king of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God. And in America, American Jews don\u2019t like him. They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re doing or saying any more, it makes no sense.\u201d\nThe remarks in question can be watched here (beginning at 36:45). Root was echoing similar statements Trump himself made earlier that day. Speaking to reporters at the White House, the president addressed the controversy over Israel\u2019s reversed decision to bar U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from entering the country.\nTrump proclaimed: \u201cWhere has the Democratic party gone? Where have they gone where they\u2019re defending these two people [Tlaib and Omar] over the state of Israel? And I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d\nRoot\u2019s original remarks came in the form of a simile, meaning it should have been clear by definition that he was not claiming that Trump actually is the King of Israel or the second coming of Christ, nor even that Jewish people in Israel believe he is those things. Rather, in order to emphasize what he perceives as the U.S. president\u2019s popularity among Israeli Jews, Root was indulging in rhetorical license, using the device of a simile, by saying Israeli Jews loved Trump as if he were the King of Israel or the second coming of Christ.\u00a0\n(It is a matter for a separate discussion that the second component of Root\u2019s simile was woefully theologically illiterate. An important distinction between Christianity and Judaism is that Judaism traditionally rejects the notion of Christ as a messiah, thereby rendering the concept of a second coming inapplicable, and this part of Root\u2019s simile nonsensical by definition.)\nRoot later emphasized the fact that he was engaging in simile, rather than claiming Trump was, in fact, the king of Israel or the second coming of Christ, or even that Israeli Jews regard him as such. During a discussion with former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly on Root\u2019s \u201cNewsmax\u201d TV show, Root said:\n\u201c\u2026 They [liberal opponents] took everything I said out of context \u2026 Did I really say, on national TV, on my \u2018Newsmax\u2019 show last night, that Donald Trump is the second coming of Christ, and he\u2019s the king of the Jews? No. I said in Israel they treat him like he\u2019s the second coming of Christ and the King of the Jews. And it\u2019s a New York expression, you know, it\u2019s like you and I could have been having an expression [sic] and I\u2019d say, \u2018Are you kidding me? In Israel they treat him like he\u2019s the King of the Jews.\u2019 Does that really mean that I believe he\u2019s the King of the Jews? \u2026 Obviously, I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\u00a0\ufeff\u00a0\nWe know that certain Christians in the United States and beyond have professed a fringe belief in Trump as a Christ-like or messianic figure. It\u2019s even possible, theoretically, that Trump himself might harbor similar suspicions of his own destiny. But the series of statements he made on Aug. 21, 2019, did not constitute evidence of any such belief on his part.\u00a0\nThe president did say \u201cI am the chosen one,\u201d but he made the remark as an aside, combining it with a theatrical glance towards the heavens, while making a broader point about his engaging in a supposedly overdue trade war with China. The context, along with Trump\u2019s penchant for flippant and tongue-in-cheek asides, makes it highly unlikely he was choosing that moment to earnestly articulate some sincere belief in his own messianic destiny.\u00a0\nIn a series of tweets, Trump quoted a controversial conspiracy theorist, Root, who had lavished praise upon the president, professing that Jewish people in Israel so admired Trump that it was as though he was the \u201cKing of Israel\u201d or \u201cthe second coming of God.\u201d But Root (as he later confirmed) was using exaggerated language as part of a simile. He was not making the factual claim that Israeli Jews literally believe that Trump is the King of Israel, or the second coming of Christ (the latter of which claims would make no sense for theological reasons, anyway.)\u00a0\nSo the widely promulgated claim that Trump, simply by quoting Root\u2019s remarks, was in effect declaring himself to be the King of Israel or the second coming of Christ, was inaccurate by a considerable distance. Trump did not even quote someone who professed that belief, and the person he did quote was not even claiming that others held that belief.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: On Aug. 21, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump articulated a belief that he is \"the chosen one,\" the \"King of Israel,\" or the \"second coming of God.\" If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

His key work in the areas of wireless telegraphy, broadcast radio, and synchronized-sound films led to his being referred to as the \u201cFather of Radio\u201d and the \u201cFather of Electronics.\u201d\nBut de Forest is also known, in a lesser sense, for famously demonstrating that persons notable for achievements in one field of science aren\u2019t necessarily reliable prognosticators about other scientific fields. For it was de Forest who boldly proclaimed in the 1950s that humanity\u2019s sending a man to the moon and returning him to Earth alive was merely a Jules Verne-esque fantasy, a \u201cvoyage [that] will never occur regardless of all future scientific advances.\u201d\nHe made his remarks during an interview with Voice of America radio, as reported by the Associated Press in February 1957:\nOne of America\u2019s most famous scientists dismissed as impossible one of modern science\u2019s most persistent dreams \u2014 the dream of travel into the outer space.\nDr. Lee De Forest, known as the \u201cFather of Electronics,\u201d predicted that man would never even reach the moon, let alone travel by rocket ship to strange worlds in distant galaxies.\n\u201cMan,\u201d declared Dr. De Forest, \u201cis inherently an earthly creature, and only his scientific imagination will ever make him a planetary emigrant.\u201d\nDe Forest invented the vacuum tube 51 years ago, and that made possible the development of modern radio broadcasting, television and radar.\nHis observations on the future were broadcast by the Voice of America, the State Dept.\u2019s overseas information program.\nDe Forest forecast transoceanic television within 10 years. He said this could be accomplished by skillful location of relay stations and by taking advantage of reflections of television waves from the ionosphere, the layer of electrical energy which surrounds the earth at a great height. \u201cBut I am much more conservative in my estimate of interspace flight,\u201d De Forest said.\nTrue, this year may become known as the year of the first man-made planet \u2014 the tiny artificial earth satellite, he said.\n\u201cBut to place a man in a multi-stage rocket and project him into the controlling gravitational field of the moon, where the passenger can make scientific observations, perhaps land alive, and then return to earth \u2014 all that constitutes a wild dream worthy of Jules Verne,\u201d he said, adding:\n\u201cI am bold enough to say that such a man-made moon voyage will never occur regardless of all future scientific advances.\u201d\nThat was not the first of de Forest\u2019s pronouncements along such lines. In an article for Popular Mechanics published five years earlier, the scientist had asserted: \u201cI do not foresee \u2018spaceships\u2019 to the moon or Mars. Mortals must live and die on Earth or within its atmosphere!\u201d\nHowever, de Forest was at least correct in anticipating the first \u201cartificial earth satellite\u201d would be launched in 1957, as the Soviet Union put Sputnik I into low Earth orbit on Oct. 4, 1957. The Soviets also accomplished the first manned space flight less than four years later, launching cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin in Vostok 1 for a single Earth orbit on April 12, 1961.\nBut it only took the United States to prove de Forest wrong with the July 1969 mission of Apollo 11 that landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon and then returned them safely to Earth. Evaluate the following assertion: Lee de Forest, the \"father of radio,\" proclaimed that a man-made moon voyage will never occur.

The accompanying text identified the drivers as volunteers headed out to help potential storm victims in Florida and the Carolinas:\nSeveral of our readers sent me a link to this incredible Facebook post written by a gentleman named Floyd Richard Burdett. It\u2019s word a read, folks. Full disclosure \u2013 I cannot independently verify where the photograph was taken.\nThere are still plenty of red-blooded American men who are willing to head towards the danger zone \u2013 girded by Almighty God and toxic masculinity. We got word that the Cajun Navy is already on the ground in Florida.\nOne of those guys is my cousin, who is part of a swift water rescue team from Memphis. They are headed to Jacksonville, Florida.\nY\u2019all say a prayer for these brave men and the good people of Florida and the Carolinas.\nLet this sink in for a minute\u2026..Hundreds and hundreds of small boats pulled by countless pickups and SUVs from across the South are headed for Florida.\nAlmost all of them driven by men. They\u2019re using their own property, sacrificing their own time, spending their own money, and risking their own lives for one reason: to help total strangers in desperate need \u2026\n\nAlthough volunteers may indeed have begun heading to Florida and/or the Carolinas to offer assistance during Hurricane Dorian in early September 2019, this particular photograph and text is dated from two years earlier and pictured members of Lousiana\u2019s \u201cCajun Navy\u201d headed to Texas (not Florida) to help rescue victims of Hurricane Harvey (not Hurricane Dorian) in August 2017 (not 2019):\nThe Houston Chronicle described the Cajun Navy\u2019s efforts in Texas at the time as follows:\nTexans are getting help from their neighbors who know too well the dangers hurricanes can bring.\nThe Cajun Navy, a band of Louisiana residents who used their boats and resources to rescue people during Hurricane Katrina, have been authorized to come to Texas and help rescue Hurricane Harvey victims.\nAt the beginning of September 2019, a representative of the Cajun Navy 2016 group said they were prepared to help with Hurricane Dorian but at the moment were unsure where to head due to the uncertain path of the storm:\n\nLike many of us, Ben Husser has been getting updates on Hurricane Dorian from the news. But unlike the rest of us, he and the search and rescue crew from Cajun Navy 2016 are headed to the action.\n\u201cOur first group is probably going to leave Monday or Monday night [September 2],\u201d said Husser.\nHusser is a volunteer for the Cajun Navy 2016. He and his team do strictly search and rescue missions, but at this point, they don\u2019t know where they are headed. This makes planning to help those in need, even more difficult, Husser say.\n\u201cAs of right now we\u2019re looking at 3 or 4 different locations,\u201d said Husser \u2026\nHusser says the Cajun Navy 2016 are second responders and will only take their boats to places where they have permission.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a fake news detection task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: On June 29, 1989, the Associated Press (AP) ran a story based on an interview with the director of the New York office of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) that began with this doomsday lede:\n\u201cA senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.\u201d\nThis statement is frequently presented as an example of climate scientists being both alarmist and incorrect, and serves as the basis for clickbait posts from several climate denial media outlets.\nThe Backstory\nThe senior U.N. official speaking to the Associated Press was Noel Brown, who served as a regional director of the United Nations Environment Program and who was not a climate scientist. While admittedly alarmist, this senior U.N official\u2019s statements appear to have been muddied further by the Associated Press\u2019s somewhat imprecise reporting on the topic.\nThe Associated Press article created confusion in two ways. First, it suggested (at least to some media outlets) that the statement meant that nations would be under water in the year 2000. In fact, his statement said nations would be under water at some time in the more distant future, \u201cIf the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.\u201d The scenarios in the papers cited by the AP described projections that went into the year 2100. Second, the article conflates statements made by Brown, which did not represent a consensus view at the time, with statements made in several governmental studies that were more representative of the consensus view.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the late 1980s, the United Nations Environment Program, along with other agencies including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), began to think seriously about the potential risks of sea-level rise from global warming. In November 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization created the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and \u201cdirected it to assess the science, impacts, and possible responses to global climate change.\u201d As part of that charge, a conference was held in Miami from Nov. 27 to Dec. 1, 1989, which \u201cfocused on the implications of sea level rise for Western Africa, the Americas, the Mediterranean Basin, and the rest of Europe.\u201d\nBrown, the UNEP official, appears to have been referencing statements made in papers prepared for this conference; the conference occurred after the interview with Brown, but those papers would have been in the works during the time of the interview. The AP story presents several facts attributed to \u201ca joint UNEP and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study.\u201d These statements appear in papers presented in a U.N./EPA report published in May 1990 titled \u201cChanging Climate and the Coast Volume 1: Adaptive Responses and their Economic, Environmental, and Institutional Implications.\u201d This includes future projections for flooding in low-elevation nations:\nAP story:\nCoastal regions will be inundated; one-sixth of Bangladesh could be flooded, displacing a fourth of its 90 million people. A fifth of Egypt\u2019s arable land in the Nile Delta would be flooded, cutting off its food supply, according to a joint UNEP and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study.\nUNEP/EPA report:\nA one-meter rise in sea level could inundate 15% of Bangladesh, and a two-meter rise could inundate Dhaka (the capital of Bangladesh) and over one-half of the populated islands of the Republic of Maldives, an atoll in the Indian Ocean.\nIn the Pacific, the atolls of Tokelau, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and those of the Marshalls could be devastated. Shanghai and Lagos \u2014 the largest cities of China and Nigeria, respectively \u2014 are less than two meters above sea level, as is 20% of the population and farmland of Egypt.\nImportantly, however, none of these scientific papers asserted that this would happen by the year 2000 \u2014 as some have taken the Associated Press lede to suggest \u2014 nor do they say anything about a 10-year window of time before that fate is sealed. The sea-level rise discussed in the UNEP report merely analyzes how much a given nation would be under water or otherwise affected given a certain level of sea-level rise. Those papers do not suggest that level of sea-level rise would occur by the year 2000 but rather articulate what could happen centuries later. The claim that these scenarios will be reality if climate change \u201cis not reversed by the year 2000\u201d does not appear to have its origin in an actual U.N report. We reached out to the United Nations Environment Program office for clarification on where this statement may have come from and will update if more information becomes available.\nSea-level projections made in the late 1980s actually hold up fairly well to sea-level projections made more recently. Via email, Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist for the independent, nongovernmental Berkeley Earth research group, told us sea-level projections made in the first IPCC report are not that far off from those made in the fifth IPCC report:\nThe scientific consensus at the time was summed up in the IPCC first assessment report, which projected sea level rise by 2100 of 0.66 meters under a high emissions scenario, with an uncertainty range spanning 0.31 meters to 1.1 meters. This is quite similar to the 0.74 meter estimate (ranging from 0.52\u00a0 to 0.98 meters) in the IPCC Fifth Assessment report published in 2013. [\u2026]\nPredictions of massive sea level rise by 2000 [were] clearly not the view of most scientists at the time, as [they were] well outside any estimates from the 1990 IPCC first assessment report.\nBecause a senior U.N. official did make those statements to the Associated Press, however, we rate this claim as \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: In 1989, a senior U.N. environmental official said, \u201cEntire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.\u201d If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: On Nov. 13, 1994, an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d entitled \u201cLisa on Ice\u201d aired on the Fox television network that featured a visual gag of text on a mobile device\u2019s screen changing from \u201cBeat Up Martin\u201d to \u201cEat Up Martha.\u201d This led many to claim that \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d had \u201cpredicted\u201d autocorrect.\nFormer NFL player and radio host Pat McAfee, for instance, outlined this claim in a popular episode of the \u201cPat McAfee Show\u201d:\n\n\u201cAuto correct errors. 1994. Before you could even play snake on the grey little box phone, they predicted that auto correct would happen \u2026 Didn\u2019t happen until 2007.\u201d\nIt would be pretty amazing if \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d truly predicted the invention of autocorrect. However, that didn\u2019t happen.\nWhen \u201cLisa on Ice\u201d first aired in November 1994, autocorrect was already a feature available in Microsoft Word. According to The New York Times, Microsoft was advertising the feature as early as October 1993, more than a year before \u201cLisa on Ice\u201d aired:\n\u201cHow fast will new Word 6.0 fix typos? How fast can you make them?\u201d asked an advertisement in a computer magazine from October 1993. The newest version of Microsoft\u2019s word processor came with a brand-new feature called AutoCorrect. Type in \u201cSHip teh cartons friday,\u201d and the program would correct your text to \u201cShip the cartons Friday.\u201d\nWhile autocorrect existed prior to this episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d (severely handicapping the show\u2019s ability to predict it), the joke in \u201cLisa on Ice\u201d is actually commenting on another technological innovation: handwriting recognition.\u00a0\nThe Apple Newton was one of the first personal digital assistants (PDAs), which hit the market in 1993. While it was an innovative product for its time, it also had problems. The device\u2019s handwriting-recognition software, for instance, wasn\u2019t great at recognizing handwritten words. This led to critiques in the media (a 1993 article in the San Francisco Examiner was titled \u201cHighly Hyped Newton Weak on Handwriting\u201d) and jokes on popular shows such as \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d\u00a0\nIn fact, school bully Kearney specifically mentions the \u201cNewton Tablet\u201d in the clip from \u201cLisa on Ice\u201d used to further this \u201cprediction\u201d claim:\n\n\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d didn\u2019t predict autocorrect. However, this joke did have an impact on the autocorrect feature that would eventually find its way onto the first iPhone.\u00a0\nCNET reported:\nApple\u2019s software engineers were so haunted by a gag in The Simpsons they spent years trying to nail the keyboard in the iPhone.\nAs part of an \u2018oral history\u2019 \u2014 essentially a lot of interviews sewn together \u2014 about the Californian company, Fast Company interviewed dozens of former Apple execs. One particularly juicy tidbit it\u2019s just revealed is that software engineers working on the iPhone were traumatised by the Simpsons making fun of the ancient Newton tablet\u2019s handwriting recognition in 1995 \u2026\n\u2026\u201dIn the hallways [at Apple] and while we were talking about the keyboard, you would always hear the words \u2018Eat Up Martha\u2019,\u201d says Nitin Ganatra, formerly Apple\u2019s director of engineering for iOS. \u201cWe needed to nail the keyboard. We needed to make sure the text input works on this thing, otherwise, \u2018Here comes the Eat Up Marthas.'\u201d\n\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d did not predict autocorrect. The visual gag in the 1994 episode \u201cLisa On Ice\u201d featuring the words \u201cBeat Up Martin\u201d changing to \u201cEat Up Martha\u201d on a mobile device was actually mocking the problematic handwriting recognition software on the Apple Newton PDA.\u00a0\nAutocorrect Prediction Summary: \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d supposedly predicted the \u201cautocorrect\u201d feature in a 1994 episode. This feature wasn\u2019t invented until 2007.\u00a0\nReferenced Episode: Nov. 13, 1994. Season 6; Episode 8.\u00a0 \u201cLisa On Ice.\u201d\nFacts: Autocorrect has been around since at least 1993. The 2007 date likely refers to the release of the first iPhone. \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d was actually commenting on Apple Newton Tablet\u2019s well-known problems with handwriting-recognition software.\u00a0\nYou can read more about \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d alleged predictions in the Snopes\u2019 collection \u201cThe Simpsons Didn\u2019t Predict That.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: The show \"The Simpsons\" predicted the common autocorrect feature on phones, tablets and computers.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: We received multiple inquiries from readers in September 2019 about the veracity of widely shared reports that claimed an abortion provider in Florida had disposed of a baby \u201cborn alive at 23 weeks\u201d by \u201cthrowing her in the trash.\u201d\nOn Sept. 23, the pro-life website LifeNews reported on U.S. Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), writing:\n\u201cThis week, at a hearing on Capitol Hill on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, Congressman Chris Smith, chair of the Pro-Life Caucus, issued the following statement \u2026\u201d\nThe article\u2019s headline claimed: \u201cBaby Born Alive at 23 Weeks Was Gasping for Air. Abortion Clinic Put Baby in a Bag, Threw Her in the Trash.\u201d\nSmith\u2019s statement came on Sept. 10, during a House minority hearing in Washington, D.C., on the subject of the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection bill, a piece of legislation that would, according to its supporters, enhance the requirements placed upon medical professionals to provide medical care for babies who survive failed abortions and are born alive. Critics say the legislation is legally unnecessary and intended to vilify abortion providers and subject them to unwarranted additional scrutiny.\nSmith, who represents the 4th congressional district of New Jersey and is chair of the Congressional pro-life caucus, used some of his time to raise the case of Sycloria Williams, a Florida woman who underwent a failed abortion and whose baby died shortly after being born alive.\u00a0\nHis remarks can be watched in full below. The most relevant portion was as follows:\n\u201cIn a Florida abortion clinic, Sycloria Williams delivered a live baby at 23 weeks gestation. The clinic owner took the baby, who was gasping for air, cut her umbilical cord, threw her into a biohazard bag and put the bag in the trash. Heartbroken, Sycloria later had a funeral for her baby girl who she named Shanice.\u201d\n\u00a0\ufeff\nOverall, Smith\u2019s description of the events in question, as well as that contained in LifeNews\u2019s headline, contained a mixture of accurate and misleading elements. The following exposition of the facts, and analysis, contains some rather graphic details of a late-term abortion, which some readers may find upsetting.\nIn July 2006, 18-year-old Sycloria Williams engaged the services of an abortion clinic in Hialeah, Florida. According to reports, she was around 23 weeks pregnant when Dr. Pierre Jean-Jacque Renelique performed the first part of the two-part dilation and evacuation abortion procedure.\nThe next day, Williams returned to the clinic in order to have the pregnancy terminated and the fetus removed from her uterus. Reportedly, Renelique was late in arriving, and Williams went into labor. The baby was delivered alive, so the clinic\u2019s co-owner, Belkis Gonzalez, cut the baby\u2019s umbilical cord and disposed of the baby in a biohazard bag.\u00a0\nIn an interview with the Florida Catholic newspaper, Williams said of the baby: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t moving much. Twitching, gasping for air. She wasn\u2019t crying though, just hissing. Hissing sounds only.\u201d\nThree years later, prosecutors in Miami-Dade County filed two charges against Gonzalez: practicing as a medical professional without a license, resulting in serious bodily injury (for the act of cutting the umbilical cord), a felony that can carry a sentence of up to 15 years in prison; and tampering with evidence for the purpose of making it unavailable in a criminal investigation (for the alleged act of hiding the biozhard bag containing the baby\u2019s remains), a felony that could carry a sentence of up to five years in prison.\u00a0\nIn charging the clinic\u2019s co-owner, prosecutors alleged she had caused the baby to suffer \u201cbrain or spinal damage and/or limitation of neurological, physical or sensory function\u201d when she severed the umbilical cord. Of the second charge, prosecutors provided the following details, claiming Gonzalez had:\n\u201c\u2026 Unlawfully and feloniously, knowing that a criminal trial or proceeding or an investigation \u2026 was pending \u2026, alter, destroy, conceal or remove evidence, to wit: biohazard bags and/or their contents, including the body of S.D.O., a female infant, and/or fetal remains and/or placenta and/or umbilical cord remnants, \u2026 with the purpose to impair the verity or availability of said evidence \u2026\u201d\nIn court filings, Gonzalez did not reject the claim that she had disposed of the baby\u2019s remains in a biohazard bag, only that she had deliberately hidden those remains from police searches, in an effort to thwart their investigations. There does not appear to be a substantive dispute over her having disposed of the remains, though we did not find any evidence that she had, specifically, \u201cthrown\u201d the remains into a biohazard bag. That description appears to be an example of poetic license on the part of Rep. Smith, though ultimately the evidence is lacking.\u00a0 \u00a0\nIn court filings, Gonzalez accepted that the baby had been delivered prematurely in the clinic, and that she had personally cut the umbilical cord after that delivery, so this component of the claim made by Smith and LifeNews\u00a0was accurate. However, Gonzalez denied the charge of causing serious bodily injury by practicing medicine while unlicensed, in part on the basis that the baby was non-viable \u2014 an important principle in good-faith ethical and medical debates over late-term abortion and an important factual element that Smith and others later omitted from their accounts of the Williams case.\u00a0\nIn early 2011, Gonzalez filed a motion to dismiss the charges against her. In that motion, her attorneys cited testimony provided by two medical experts for the prosecution, both of whom agreed that the baby, which one estimated to have a gestational age of 21.5 weeks, was non-viable when she was delivered, meaning she could never have survived outside the womb for more than mere moments, no matter what attempts were made to save her life.\nThe motion quoted Dr. William Smalling, a neonatologist and medical expert for the prosecution, as saying in deposition:\n\u201cAfter reviewing the charts [presented by law enforcement], it was deemed that the fetus was about twenty-one and a half weeks. And based on estimation by the pathology report and the ultrasound, a fetus of that age would not be \u2014 would be considered non-viable, which means it wasn\u2019t mature enough to survive outside of the uterus regardless of whatever intervention was done. So I felt that cutting the umbilical cord played no role on [sic] the survival of the infant, because the baby was deemed to be not able to survive.\u201d\nThe second prosecution expert, obstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Glenn Salkind, wrote in an affidavit that \u201cthe fetus was not viable at the time of the termination of pregnancy.\u201d Gonzalez also quoted from the death certificate produced for the infant, which wrote that \u201cthe medical examiner concluded the cause of death was extreme prematurity and the manner of death to be natural.\u201d\nWhatever one\u2019s subjective moral viewpoint, a non-trivial difference does exist between a set of circumstances in which a fetus, intended for abortion, is instead delivered alive and breathing and has a chance of surviving with the help of medical intervention, as compared to a fetus that perhaps momentarily struggles to gain breath or twitches but has no realistic prospect of surviving beyond a couple of minutes, regardless of what life-saving efforts take place.\u00a0\nThis is not to defend or condemn one course of action over another, including the decisions made by clinic staff including Gonzalez, but rather to simply point out that a difference does exist where fetal viability comes into question.\nFrom an ethical point of view, it is worth noting that, at the time she cut the umbilical cord and disposed of the baby, Gonzalez may or may not have been aware of the fact that, as medical professionals later attested, the fetus was non-viable and had no realistic hope of survival.\u00a0\nEven if her own experience and knowledge reliably informed her that the fetus could not survive, cutting the umbilical cord and disposing of the remains was not the only course of action immediately available to her. She could, for example, have endeavored to provide as much comfort as possible to the baby in the circumstances, or sought a second opinion from a licensed medical professional, and so on.\u00a0\nIn the context of this fact check, and the claims made by Smith, LifeNews, and others, it is important to note that their description of the incident \u2014 the baby was \u201cborn alive\u201d and \u201cgasping for air\u201d before being disposed of by clinic staff \u2014 likely gave many readers the impression that the baby had a chance of survival and may well have lived had Gonzalez not taken the actions she did. That was not the case, as attested by medical experts hired by prosecutors against Gonzalez, and therefore this element of those descriptions had a tendency to be misleading.\u00a0\nIn 2011, prosecutors accepted Gonzalez\u2019 motion to dismiss the charges against her, writing that the evidence available was not sufficient to refute the defendant\u2019s claims. Eleventh Circuit Court Judge John Thornton dismissed the charges against Gonzalez in March 2011.\u00a0\nWilliams also took a civil case against the clinic and several of its staff (including Gonzalez and Renelique, the doctor who was schedule to perform the second part of the abortion procedure in July 2006). She sued them for professional malpractice in 2009, but the case was dismissed in 2012.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: In 2006, an abortion-clinic owner cut the umbilical cord of a baby born alive before \"throwing\" her in a biohazard bag and putting her remains in \"the trash.\" If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

It might also have led some to believe Warren had proposed that all sex-reassignment surgeries must be taxpayer-funded, which is not the case.\nNonetheless, an examination of the record, and confirmation from Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, make it clear that she does indeed support covering sex-reassignment surgery under taxpayer-funded programs like Medicaid, as well as full legal access to the surgery, under private health insurance and Obamacare.\u00a0\nWe asked the Warren campaign whether she supports gender-reassignment surgery, and other transition-related services such as medication, being made available at low cost or no cost, under taxpayer-funded programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare (for military service members and veterans), as well as through Obamacare and private health insurance policies. A campaign spokesperson was unequivocal in response: \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0\nThe campaign also directed us to a September 2019 interview Warren conducted with \u201cHIV Plus\u201d magazine, in which she gave further details about her stance on the issue. The interview refers to Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), so a brief explanation is warranted.\u00a0\nSection 1557\u00a0incorporated existing anti-discrimination law into the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It prohibited healthcare or insurance providers that receive federal funding (include state-by-state Medicaid programs) from discriminating against patients on the basis of their sex, race, religion, national origin, and so on.\u00a0\nIn 2016, HHS under President Barack Obama implemented a new rule that expanded those protections from discrimination and, most notably, defined sex discrimination as including discrimination on the basis of a patient\u2019s gender identity, as well as their having previously terminated a pregnancy, among other changes.\nFederally funded healthcare and insurance providers (including state Medicaid programs) could not deny services or treatment access to individuals on the basis of their gender identity, and could not categorically refuse to cover treatments related to gender transition, such as sex-reassignment surgery.\u00a0\nIn May 2019, HHS under President Donald Trump proposed another new rule that would largely reverse the Section 1557 expansions brought by the Obama administration, removing gender identity and pregnancy termination from the definition of sex discrimination. It would also add an explicit religious freedom exemption from the requirements of Section 1557. The department wrote in a press release:\n\u201cIn 2016, HHS issued a new rule that redefined discrimination \u2018on the basis of sex\u2019 to include termination of pregnancy and gender identity which it defined as one\u2019s internal sense of being \u2018male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female.\u2019 In response to a subsequent lawsuit by several states and healthcare entities, on December 31, 2016, a federal court preliminarily enjoined the rule\u2019s gender identity and termination of pregnancy provisions on a nationwide basis, finding them contrary to the applicable civil rights law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\u201cA second federal court agreed. Because the preliminary injunction continues to be in effect, HHS cannot, and has not since the date of the injunction, enforced the rule\u2019s provisions the court said are likely unlawful. The proposed rule would revise the provisions subject to those injunctions to conform with the plain understanding recognized by the court.\u201d\nWith that context and background in mind, the following is the most relevant exchange from Warren\u2019s September 2019 interview with \u201cHIV Plus\u201d magazine:\nInterviewer:\u2026If elected, would you support a reinterpretation of Section 1557 of the ACA as covering transgender people and champion the passage of the Equality Act? How would you protect the rights, well-being, and lives of transgender people living in this country, while ensuring that they receive the healthcare and housing necessary to be virally suppressed?\u201d\nWarren: Discrimination against transgender Americans is unconstitutional and we need to fight back. HHS\u2019s proposed reinterpretation of Section 1557 rolls back critical nondiscrimination protections, allowing health insurance companies to refuse to cover and health care providers to deny health services to transgender people, particularly those with HIV/AIDS, and to those who have had or are seeking an abortion. It also removes requirements to make information language-accessible, which will harm transgender immigrants. As President, I will direct HHS to interpret Section 1557 under its 2016 guidance, to fully uphold civil rights and nondiscrimination protections. I will also direct the CDC to collect accurate data on the health of transgender people and am a co-sponsor of the Equality Act, which bans discrimination against transgender individuals in health care and housing.\nWarren\u2019s declaration that she would as president \u201cdirect HHS to interpret Section 1557 under its 2016 guidance\u201d means she would enforce, once again, a set of rules that mean sex-reassignment surgery would be covered under federal programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, including state-by-state Medicaid programs.\nAs such, it is accurate to claim that Warren does propose and has proposed that taxpayers should cover the cost of some sex-reassignment surgeries, as they do other treatments and services, under those programs.\nWarren was also one of 31 U.S. Senators who signed on to a June 2019 letter to Trump\u2019s HHS, which opposed and criticized the proposed reversal of the 2016 anti-discrimination enhancements. Warren was joined in signing that latter by fellow presidential candidates and U.S. Senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, and Cory Booker.\u00a0\nWarren has therefore put on the record, several times in 2019, her support for sex-reassignment surgery being included among the treatments and services covered under taxpayer-funded programs, as well as under Obamacare and private health insurance policies.\u00a0\nHowever, the OneNewsNetwork\u00a0headline had a tendency to mislead some readers who may have interpreted its phrasing to mean that Warren had said, word-for-word, \u201ctaxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery,\u201d or that she had advocated taxpayers must fund any and all sex reassignment surgery, rather than simply adding one more procedure to the list of procedures taxpayers already fund under Medicaid and similar federal programs.\nAs such, we issue a rating of \u201cMostly True.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said or argued to the effect that \"taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery.\" If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

This book is being sold as a children\u2019s book. Googled title and can be purchased online at: Barnes&Noble, Target, WalMart, Ebay, Amazon.\nIf You Give a Pig the White House: A Parody by Faye Kanouse , Amy Zhing (Illustrator) https://t.co/uyTm0kUz1T\n\u2014 ForexBlueLady (@ForexBlueLady1) October 5, 2019\n\n\u00a0\nAs of Oct. 8, Barnes & Noble did sell the book, both on their website and in stores around the country. However, it was placed in the humor section of stores, not in the children\u2019s section, and the book\u2019s publishers, MacMillan, described the volume as an \u201cadult parody\u201d of a well-known children\u2019s book (and the book bears the descriptor \u201cA Parody\u201d on its cover).  Therefore, claims that Barnes & Noble was selling or marketing \u201cIf You Give a Pig the White House\u201d to children, as a children\u2019s book, or in the children\u2019s section were wide of the mark.\nMacMillan released \u201cIf You Give a Pig the White House\u201d a book by author Faye Kanouse and illustrator Amy Zhing, in the U.S. on Oct. 1, 2019.\n MacMillan described the book as follows:\n\nA coiffed and blustery pig has shoved his way into the White House! A cleverly worded and illustrated picture book, this is the adult parody of the beloved children\u2019s cautionary tale, If You Give a Pig a Pancake. Watch in dismay as the presidential pig gets into trouble, binges on too much Fox News and fast food, and cavalierly threatens national security. If You Give a Pig the White House both lovingly caricatures the original children\u2019s book and shows just what can happen when a greedy anti-hero tracks his hooves all over America.\n\nAs of Oct. 8, the book was being sold by Barnes & Noble, Walmart, Google Play, Apple Books, and on Amazon. Google Play and Apple Books both listed the book\u2019s genre as \u201chumor,\u201d while Amazon placed it under the \u201cparody\u201d category. Walmart\u2019s website listed it in the \u201cpolitics\u201d section of their \u201cfunny books\u201d category. None of those major retailers categorized or marketed \u201cIf You Give a Pig the White House\u201d as a children\u2019s book.\nMultiple social media posts in the early days of October criticized the Target general retail chain for purportedly selling the book and included what appeared to be a listing for the book on Target\u2019s website. As of Oct. 8, that web page displayed the message \u201cproduct not available\u201d (although the Target website displays the same message even when the URL in question does not exist or never contained a listing for an actual item).\nWe asked Target whether they had ever sold \u201cIf You Give a Pig a White House,\u201d but a spokesperson only stated \u201cTarget does not carry this item.\u201d We made repeated attempts to press Target on whether they had previously sold the book before deciding to no longer offer it (and if so, why they dropped it).  We did not receive any further response.\nOn their website, Barnes & Noble listed the book in the \u201chumor\u201d section, and that categorization was similar to the chain\u2019s brick and mortar stores across the country. On Oct. 8, we contacted six Barnes & Noble locations across the U.S. by phone, calling outlets in California, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas. Every store we contacted had at least one copy of the book, and every store, without exception, shelved it in the \u201chumor\u201d section and not the children\u2019s section. That data corresponds to a company-wide policy of marketing the book just as MacMillan described it \u2014 as an \u201cadult parody.\u201d\nIn the environment of a public book store, customers and browsing members of the public can sometimes pick up books from one section, leaf through them, and then place them in a different section. In this manner, it is possible that in some instances a member of the public might have left or spotted a stray copy of \u201cIf You Give a Pig the White House\u201d in the children\u2019s section of a Barnes & Noble store. However, this would have been an aberration, rather than the result of company policy or any attempt to market or sell the book to children. Evaluate the following assertion: In October 2019, Barnes & Noble sold or marketed a satire of Donald Trump's presidency as a children's book, or placed it in the children's section of stores. If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

Police looked into this video after it started circulating attached to rumors concerning criminal behavior. They found that the boy had accidentally drowned and that the family packed his body in ice, due to the high temperatures of summer, in order to transport him back home for burial.\u00a0\nA Weibo message posted by the\u00a0Public Security Bureau of Yiyang City, Hunan province explained (translated via Google and edited for clarity):\n\u201cThe child in the video\u2026 died in the waters of relatives in Guangzhou.

Therefore, the above information is a rumor.\nIt should also be noted that the viral video shown above contains a few jarring edits. The first 15 seconds, in fact, which show people gathered near a body of water and then two people on the ground getting beat up, appears to come from an entirely separate incident.\u00a0Zhejiang Online reported in 2017 that the first portion of this video actually shows an unrelated incident in the town of Shaojiaqiaozhen in the Chinese province Guizhou in which two men were beat up in December 2017 after being accused of attempting to defraud elderly people:\nOn December 14, 2017, Wang and Lumou and other four people went to the triangle dam village of Shaojiaqiao Town to sell plaster to middle-aged and elderly people. The people in the village of the dam were mistaken for fraud and theft. Beaten. Someone took a live video and posted it online, rumoring that \u201cthe gangsters are robbing children and being besieged.\u201d\nThe fact that this video features footage from at least two different incidents and has been shared with a variety of unfounded rumors should immediately raise some red flags for viewers. The claim that this video shows a child who was frozen alive for the purposes of harvesting organs is unsubstantiated and appears to have been made up out of whole cloth.\nThe portion of the video showing a child covered in ice in a small box actually shows a family grieving as they prepared this child for burial after he accidentally drowned.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: A video shows 300 children who were found frozen alive for purposes of organ harvesting.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: On Oct. 10, 2019, many readers came across news stories about an invasive species of fish called the snakehead fish that had been discovered in Georgia. While these stories largely dealt with wildlife officials\u2019 attempts to eradicate the species, what caught the attention of most readers were brief mentions of this fish\u2019s unique ability to survive on land.\nCNN reported:\nA snakehead fish that survives on land was discovered in Georgia. Officials want it dead\nAn invasive fish species that can breathe air and survive on land has been found in Georgia for the first time. And officials are warning anyone who comes into contact with the species to kill it immediately.\nAn angler caught the northern snakehead fish this month in a pond in Gwinnett County, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources\u2019 Wildlife Resources Division said Tuesday.\n\u201cThanks to the quick report by an angler, our staff was able to investigate and confirm the presence of this species in this water body,\u201d said Matt Thomas, chief of fisheries for the Wildlife Resources Division. \u201cWe are now taking steps to determine if they have spread from this water body and, hopefully, keep it from spreading to other Georgia waters.\u201d\nThe snakehead fish can truly survive on land. However, some readers may have been left with the impression that this species of fish can\u00a0live\u00a0on land for an indefinite period of time.\u00a0\nThere are approximately 21 species of snakehead fish. The northern snakehead (Channa argus) is a bimodal breathing fish thanks to a lung-like labyrinth organ near its gills. The snakehead can store atmospheric oxygen in this organ and then draw from this supply as it swims. This allows the snakehead to survive in low oxygen water. This fish can also use its unique bimodal breathing ability to move between bodies of waters.\nThe Smithsonian writes:\nUnlike most fish, the northern snakehead has little sacs above its gills that function almost like lungs; the fish can surface and suck air into the sacs, then draw oxygen from the stored air as it swims. The air sacs are handy for surviving in waters that are low in oxygen, and even allow the fish to survive out of water for a couple of days, as long as it doesn\u2019t dry out.\nA research article published in Biology Open\u00a0in 2018 elaborated on the air-breathing abilities of the snakehead:\u00a0\nThe northern snakehead (Channa argus) is a species of air-breathing fish that is widely distributed in East Asia. This fish has a peculiar accessory breathing organ, the suprabranchial chamber, by which the fish breathes air at the water\u2019s surface using a cough-like mechanism (Ishimatsu and Itazawa, 1981; Lefevre et al., 2014), making possible short-term survival out of water (Nagata and Nakata, 1988). The suprabranchial chamber of Channa possesses a richly vascularized wall for gas exchange. It communicates with the buccopharyngeal cavity through a ventral opening guarded by a \u2018shutter\u2019 plate bone outgrowth of the first branchial arch, which can close the inhalant aperture of the suprabranchial chamber during expiration (Munshi, 1962).\nWhile a snakehead\u2019s ability to breath air may certainly come as a surprise to many, this is not the only species of fish with this ability.\u00a0Andy Turko, the co-author of a 2015 study into one such species, the mangrove rivulus, spoke to National Geographic about these amphibious fish:\u00a0\nFish use gills to take in oxygen from the water. But many fish, like the mangrove rivulus, have adaptations that let them breathe air.\nFor instance, mangrove rivulus \u201chave specialized skin that takes on many of the roles of gills,\u201d such as maintaining salt levels, Turko says. [\u2026]\nThe walking catfish, a Southeast Asian native that\u2019s invaded South Florida, has an extra organ that supports its gills and helps it take in oxygen from the air.\nThis is not the first time that the snakehead has made national news. In 2002, there was a bit of a panic after snakeheads were found in a pond in Crofton, Maryland. The snakehead fish\u2019s ability to survive on land, its scary-sounding name, and the fact that it is considered an invasive species, led to a full-blown media circus about the discovery as the public imagined \u201cmonster fish\u201d stalking the woods in search of prey.\u00a0\nThe incident even inspired a couple of horror movies, such as \u201cFrankenfish\u201d and \u201cSnakehead Terror\u201d:\n\n\nThe snakehead can truly survive out of water for a few days. However, this fish does not have the ability to traverse long distances over land, nor is it an adept ground hunter.\u00a0\nWhit Gibbons, professor emeritus of ecology at the University of Georgia, wrote in 2017:\nYoung snakeheads eat a variety of zooplankton and small aquatic insects. Adults eat other fish, sometimes one-third the length of their own bodies, as well as crawfish and frogs. Snakeheads are different from most other fish, which cannot survive for long out of water.\nAdult northern snakeheads have gills but can also gulp air and have been documented to live out of water for up to four days. However, although a young one may travel overland for several feet, a full-grown adult is too large to move effectively, so your pet chihuahua will probably be safe if it can make it to the pet door.\nHere\u2019s a video of a snakehead in Thailand as it \u201cwalks,\u201d crawls, or wiggles its way back to the water:\n Evaluate the following assertion: The snakehead fish can survive on land.

Most of the story consists of quotes from angry attendees at the school board meeting the day before, during which the curriculum was approved unanimously. The new curriculum is expected to go into effect in May 2020.\nAlthough Austin Independent School District (Austin ISD) board did vote to update the sex-ed curriculum for third- to eighth-graders for the first time in 10 years, the Starnes article appeared designed to elicit maximum fear and outrage from readers. While liberally quoting from opponents of the curriculum update, it briefly describes supporters like this: \u201cThose speaking on behalf of the plan included a nine-year-old child, a fourth-grader, the parent of a transgender second-grader, a lady who identified by the pronoun \u2018they/them\u2019 and some gal wearing a t-shirt that read, \u2018I met God. They\u2019re queer, y\u2019all.'\u201d\n\u201cIn spite of overwhelming opposition from parents and pastors, the district\u2019s trustees voted early Tuesday morning to implement a pornographic sex education policy that includes instruction on anal sex and how to place a condom on an erect penis,\u201d Starnes reported.\nThe article was short on facts. No, parents will not be \u201cmandated\u201d to send their children to \u201cpornographic\u201d instructional sessions. For starters, none of the sex-ed lessons at Austin schools are \u201cmandated,\u201d and parents can opt their children out of \u201cone, several, or all lessons,\u201d according to Michele Rusnak, health and physical education supervisor for Austin ISD.\n\u201cOpt out letters are provided to parents at the Parent Orientation meeting that happens in March or April, which is provided by the principal,\u201d Rusnak said in an email to Snopes. \u201cThe campus also sends out the letter at least 3 weeks prior to instruction, which happens in May. Students opting out are provided SEL [social and emotional learning] type lessons in a different location.\u201d\nRusnak added that the new curriculum does not teach students \u201chow to have anal sex,\u201d but instead \u201crefers to how anal sex is a way to transmit [sexually transmitted infections].\u201d Overviews of both the elementary-level and middle school-level curricula can be found on Austin ISD\u2019s website.\nThe curricula are categorized into the categories of \u201chealthy relationships\u201d; \u201cpersonal safety\u201d; \u201cidentity\u201d; \u201canatomy and physiology\u201d; and \u201cpuberty and adolescent development.\u201d When children reach the fifth grade, two additional categories are added: \u201cpregnancy and reproduction,\u201d and \u201csexually transmitted diseases and HIV.\u201d\nThe curricula state that the older students will learn, among many other topics, differing expressions of gender and how to communicate respectfully about that, along with \u201cmedically accurate\u201d information and terminology about topics like puberty, reproduction, intercourse, and sexually transmitted diseases and prevention. The courses also teach children how to maintain personal boundaries and how the media can impact body image.\nBecause the Starnes article falsely states that the sex-ed classes offered at Austin ISD are \u201cmandatory\u201d when parents can in fact opt their children out, and because it grossly misrepresents the course material, we are labeling this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: Austin public schools will force parents to allow the district to teach children \"how to have anal sex.\" If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

It wouldn\u2019t shock actuaries, who know that the average life expectancy in the United States is 78.6 years. It wouldn\u2019t shock statisticians, who know that the U.S. death rate among 75- to 84-year-olds is 4,472.6 deaths per 100,000 people a year, which would equate to over 100 deaths per 3,000 people annually.\nNonetheless, it appears to have shocked the editors at the anti-vaccine website Health Impact News. In 2013, that outlet published a story with the misleading headline \u201c23 Seniors Died After Receiving Flu Shot Sold by Pharmacies.\u201d Snopes continues to get worried inquiries about the claim every flu season. Health Impact News\u2019 story came from the publicly available insert that comes with a specific flu shot marketed as \u201cFluzone High-Dose,\u201d which discussed the results of scientific testing that went into approving the vaccine for use in 2009:\nWithin 6 months post-vaccination, 156 (6.1%) Fluzone High-Dose recipients and 93 (7.4%)\u00a0 Fluzone recipients experienced a serious adverse event. No deaths were reported within 28 days post-vaccination. A total of 23 deaths were reported during the period Day 29\u2013180 post-vaccination: (0.6%) among Fluzone High-Dose recipients and 7 (0.6%) among Fluzone 1 recipients. The majority of these participants had a medical history of cardiac, hepatic, neoplastic, renal, and/or respiratory diseases. No deaths were considered to be caused by vaccination.\nFluzone High-Dose, as the name implies, contains more antigens than the regular inactivated influenza virus, thereby creating more antibodies capable of defending the body against influenza. The necessity for such a drug stems from the fact that seniors require more antibodies than younger individuals to fight the flu, and because they die from it at higher rates. The results in the drug insert discussed by Health Impact News stem from a Phase Three clinical trial that occurred between 2006 and 2007 and whose results led to approval of the drug.\u00a0\nHealth Impact News, based on the vaccine insert, makes three poorly formulated assertions under the guise of \u201cjust asking questions.\u201d Most of the answers to these questions could have been found by analyzing the publicly available raw data from the clinical trial or by reading the study that was published as a result of that trial:\nAs a general rule, a temporal relationship between a vaccination and a death \u2014 especially when the considered period of time includes 180 days of follow-up \u2014 is not sufficient evidence that the vaccination caused that death. A death can be attributable to a vaccination if it appears to have been caused by an established and known scientific mechanism \u2014 these are summarized in a 2011 National Academies publication and are rooted in rigorous epidemiological data \u2014 or if an acute, adverse reaction, such as anaphylactic shock following administration, clearly causes the death. The fact that a senior with an average age of 73 died at some point between 29 and 150 days after receiving a flu shot is not evidence of death from a flu shot, nor does any reason exist that death from a flu shot should be the default assumption over that period of time.\u00a0\nThe Health Impact News claim that \u201cthe deaths [should] be equally spread out through all time periods\u201d is confusing and betrays an ignorance of the underlying study. Follow-up monitoring of participants occurred over 180 days split into two periods of time. The first time period monitored by the researchers lasted 28 days. The second monitoring period lasted the following 152 days. No reasonable person would argue that a person has an equal chance of death \u2014 all other issues ignored \u2014 over a 28-day period versus a 152-day period.\nThough no data is presented about the health of the participants who died during the trial, Health Impact News again relies on the baseless assumption that people can die during a clinical trial in only two ways: from a condition one had prior to receiving a drug and from the drug itself being tested in the trial. In fact, a condition known as \u201cold age\u201d makes one more susceptible to a wide variety of illnesses that could conceivably develop over 180 days.\nWhat we do know is that the population of people in this clinical trial who received the high-dose flu shot and the people who received the regular dose of the flu shot were statistically identical from a pre-existing health condition perspective. Further, if the implication is that the flu shot caused the death of 23 people, one might reasonably infer that more deaths would be expected in the high-dose group compared to the low-dose group. This was not the case: 16 of the deaths came from the 2,573 individuals who received the high-dose vaccine, and seven came from the 1,260 who received the other vaccine. From a percentage basis, 0.6% of participants in both the high-dose and low-dose groups died during the 180-day monitoring period.\nHealth Impact News spends several paragraphs convincing the reader that giving seniors a higher dose of a flu shot is inherently wrong while ignoring voluminous scientific evidence supporting the notion that the elderly need a higher dose, and that such a product could save countless lives. Ironically, they then present (without context) the results of a study that unequivocally demonstrates that a higher dose did not create any increase in long-term adverse effects but did increase the immunity of seniors. It is true that 23 people (out of 3,800) died during the 180-day period following vaccination, but this death rate is on par with the U.S. rate for that age group regardless of participation in a trial.\nBecause no evidence is provided for the claim that these 23 deaths were linked in any way to the trial in either Health Impact News\u2019 reporting, the raw clinical trial data, or the published report based on that trial, we rank the assertion as \u201cFalse.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: The high-dose Fluzone vaccine caused the deaths of 23 senior citizens during a clinical trial.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: We now accept as commonplace the notion that actors in popular television shows are set for life financially, as we read about how cast members in hit shows such as \u201cFriends,\u201d \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d not only were paid upwards of $1 million per episode during those series\u2019 initial runs, but then earned millions of dollars more in residuals and royalties from syndication deals, DVD sales, and video streaming.\nThat wasn\u2019t always the case, however. The actors from television shows of decades past \u2014 shows whose episodes have been continuously rerun countless thousands of times all over the world and are touchstones of popular culture \u2014 did not reap any such bounty. Those cast members were typically paid salaries that ranged from modest to pretty good, and they may have received additional payments for the first few airings of episodes in which they appeared, but that was it \u2014 they collected little or no residuals when their shows were sold into syndication, and no royalties from a home video market that didn\u2019t yet exist.\nAs Eve Plumb, who portrayed Jan Brady on the 1970s sitcom \u201cThe Brady Bunch,\u201d revealed in 2011: \u201cThe biggest misconception is that we\u2019re all rich from it, but we are not. We have not been paid for reruns of the show for many, many years. We are not making money off of it at all.\u201d\nThe one notable exception to this circumstance, according to legend, is actress Dawn Wells, who played the character of Mary Ann Summers in the 1960s sitcom \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island.\u201d Numerous websites such as Mental Floss have offered versions of the following tale about how Wells supposedly parlayed her three seasons on the show into a lifetime of paychecks:\nWells was married to talent agent Larry Rosen when she was hired for the Gilligan cast, and it was Rosen who noted the clause in her contract (which was standard at the time) that limited her to collecting residuals only the first five times any episode re-ran after its original airing. Rosen told Wells that if the series was a success, this clause could cost her a lot of money. Wells was the only castaway who asked for an amendment to that residual clause in her contract, and the producers granted it, never thinking the series would be on the air 40 years later. As a result, [producer] Sherwood Schwartz and Dawn Wells are the only two folks connected with the show who still receive money from it.\nThis narrative seems quite improbable on its face. Actors are generally represented by a bevy of various unions, guilds, agents, and lawyers, and the idea that only one person in the whole television industry possessed the savvy to recognize that a contractual entitlement to residuals was a potentially lucrative reward worth pursuing strains credulity.\nMoreover, the goal of most television producers in that era was to keep their shows going long enough (generally three years) to amass a sufficient number of episodes for syndication deals after those series ended their original network runs, as the syndication market provided the bulk of potential profits. While producers may not have expected their shows to still be airing \u201c40 years later,\u201d they certainly hoped their series would enjoy long TV afterlives, and they would not be keen on sharing those revenues with actors who had little bargaining power (nor would they want to set a precedent for other actors to follow). A minor actor in a secondary role who dared to press for a contractual guarantee to perpetual royalties likely would have been curtly informed how quickly and easily she could be replaced.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to speculate on the state of 1960s television to know the answer here, though, because Wells herself has repeatedly stated that this legend is false. In 2014, for example, Wells said during an interview that she was paid a salary roughly equivalent to $50,000 in today\u2019s dollars and \u201cnever received any residuals\u201d:\nQ: They stopped making Gilligan\u2019s Island 47 years ago. Do you still receive residuals?\nA: We never received any residuals.\nQ: How much money did you make for Gilligan\u2019s Island?\nA: Nothing. I don\u2019t know, maybe I made $700 a week. I understand (the producer) Mr. Schwartz made $90 million on the reruns alone. I think we got paid \u2026 maybe we made $50,000, I don\u2019t know.\nAnd in a 2016 interview, she answered the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s one big myth about [Gilligan\u2019s Island]?\u201d by asserting that the actors \u201cdidn\u2019t really get a dime\u201d in residuals:\nA misconception is that we must be wealthy, rolling in the dough, because we got residuals. We didn\u2019t really get a dime. I think my salary \u2014 of course, I was low on the totem pole, Ginger [Tina Louise] and Thurston [Jim Backus] got more \u2014 was $750 a week. Sherwood Schwartz, our producer, reportedly made $90 million on the reruns alone!\nA 2014 Washington Post obituary of Wells\u2019 cast mate Russell Johnson, who played the Professor, also observed that Johnson \u201cresented \u2026 that he and other cast members were left out of the bulk of the syndication profits.\u201d\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the daughter of \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d creator Sherwood Schwartz disputed the oft-repeated claim that her father realized as much as $90 million from the series:\nSchwartz\u2019s daughter Hope Juber dismissed that estimate as an urban myth. \u201cWhile he, and my family were certainly comfortable, that kind of wild estimate is ridiculous and surprising,\u201d she wrote in an email. She said her father made his own deal with the studio just like the cast members, but not for that kind of money. She added, \u201cIf there is $90 million, it must be buried in a chest on the island somewhere because we\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: Actress Dawn Wells was the only \"Gilligan's Island\" cast member to receive residual payments for syndicated airings of the show.

The New York Post, CBS News, and CNN were among the many national news outlets to report the development.\nThose reports were accurate. On Nov. 25, A.C. Moore\u2019s parent company published a press release that stated that:\nNicole Crafts has decided to exit its retail operations by retaining the retail and real estate divisions of\u00a0Gordon Brothers\u00a0to close the\u00a0A.C.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In late 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of a viral Facebook post that presented an account of the actor Jimmy Stewart\u2019s military service during World War II.\nThe post claimed a profound link between the trauma Stewart suffered from flying 20 combat missions over Germany and his ability to immerse himself in the role of George Bailey, the melancholic protagonist of the classic American film (and holiday favorite) \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d\nOn Dec. 22, 2018, Ned Forney \u2014 a writer who devotes his Facebook page to personal histories and tributes to many U.S. military service members \u2014 posted one such account of Stewart\u2019s patriotism and dedication, and the emotional scars he bore from his sacrifice:\nFor all the fans of \u201cIt\u2019s A Wonderful Life\u201d and Jimmy Stewart \u2026\nJust months after winning his 1941 Academy Award for best actor in \u201cThe Philadelphia Story,\u201d Jimmy Stewart, one of the best-known actors of the day, left Hollywood and joined the US Army. He was the first big-name movie star to enlist in World War II.\nAn accomplished private pilot, the 33-year-old Hollywood icon became a US Army Air Force aviator, earning his 2nd Lieutenant commission in early 1942. With his celebrity status and huge popularity with the American public, he was assigned to starring in recruiting films, attending rallies, and training younger pilots.\nStewart, however, wasn\u2019t satisfied. He wanted to fly combat missions in Europe, not spend time in a stateside training command. By 1944, frustrated and feeling the war was passing him by, he asked his commanding officer to transfer him to a unit deploying to Europe. His request was reluctantly granted.\nStewart, now a Captain, was sent to England, where he spent the next 18 months flying B-24 Liberator bombers over Germany. Throughout his time overseas, the US Army Air Corps\u2019 top brass had tried to keep the popular movie star from flying over enemy territory. But Stewart would hear nothing of it.\nDetermined to lead by example, he bucked the system, assigning himself to every combat mission he could. By the end of the war he was one of the most respected and decorated pilots in his unit.\nBut his wartime service came at a high personal price. In the final months of WWII he was grounded for being \u201cflak happy,\u201d today called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\nWhen he returned to the US in August 1945, Stewart was a changed man. He had lost so much weight that he looked sickly. He rarely slept, and when he did he had nightmares of planes exploding and men falling through the air screaming (in one mission alone his unit had lost 13 planes and 130 men, most of whom he knew personally).\nHe was depressed, couldn\u2019t focus, and refused to talk to anyone about his war experiences. His acting career was all but over. As one of Stewart\u2019s biographers put it, \u201cEvery decision he made [during the war] was going to preserve life or cost lives. He took back to Hollywood all the stress that he had built up.\u201d\nIn 1946 he got his break. He took the role of George Bailey, the suicidal father in \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d The rest is history. Actors and crew of the set realized that in many of the disturbing scenes of George Bailey unraveling in front of his family, Stewart wasn\u2019t acting. His PTSD was being captured on filmed for potentially millions to see.\nBut despite Stewart\u2019s inner turmoil, making the movie was therapeutic for the combat veteran. He would go on to become one of the most accomplished and loved actors in American history.\nWhen asked in 1941 why he wanted to leave his acting career to fly combat missions over Nazi Germany, he said, \u201cThis country\u2019s conscience is bigger than all the studios in Hollywood put together, and the time will come when we\u2019ll have to fight.\u201d\nThis weekend, as many of us watch the classic Christmas film, \u201cIt\u2019s A Wonderful Life,\u201d it\u2019s also a fitting time to remember the sacrifices of Jimmy Stewart and all the men who gave up so much to serve their country during wartime. We will always remember you!\nPostscript: While fighting in Europe, Stewart\u2019s Oscar statue was proudly displayed in his father\u2019s Pennsylvania hardware store. Throughout his life, the beloved actor always said his father, a World War I veteran, was the person who had made the biggest impact on him. Jimmy Stewart was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985 and died in 1997 at the age of 89.\nIt\u2019s a stirring account, and one firmly rooted in an accurate presentation of the basic sequence of events of Stewart\u2019s involvement in World War II. However, elements of the story \u2014 the claim that Stewart was removed from flying missions over Germany because he suffered from PTSD, and descriptions of him suffering nightmares of \u201cmen falling through the air screaming\u201d \u2014 appear to be rather thinly sourced and not corroborated in other accounts of the actor\u2019s military service.\nThe version of events presented in the meme appears to have borrowed heavily from a 2016 book by the nonfiction writer Robert Matzen, called \u201cMission: Jimmy Stewart and the Fight for Europe.\u201d The book charted Stewart\u2019s early career as an actor, his friendships and relationships, his family\u2019s history of military service, his famously close and affectionate bond with his father, and his entry into military service during World War II.\u00a0\nHowever, the book attracted attention in the media for the revelatory claim that Stewart had suffered from what would now be diagnosed as PTSD, as a result of the horrors of flying 20 bombing missions over Germany, to such an extent that Stewart had to withdraw from combat missions, and that his trauma was visible to those on the set of \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what Matzen wrote in the book itself about Stewart\u2019s state of mind after returning to Hollywood from the war:\nJim Stewart was a man at sea, untethered by his old employer, yet also away from the regimentation of the service, the adrenalin rush, the striving toward great accomplishments, and the defying of odds with an extraordinary collection of brothers in arms who had become like sons to him. Combat fatigue and shell shock were the terms of the day for what eventually became known as post-traumatic stress disorder, but whatever the name, Stewart suffered along with millions of other combat veterans who had returned to homes the world over, to friends and family who just couldn\u2019t understand what they had experienced.\u00a0\nOn several occasions throughout the book, Matzen described Stewart as \u201cflak happy,\u201d a World War II-era phrase for symptoms of anxiety, sleeplessness, nightmares, and so on, which would now likely be diagnosed as PTSD. In one instance, he cited an interview he conducted with Lt. Barry Shillito, a fellow pilot and contemporary of Stewart\u2019s, as follows:\n\u201c\u2026 Shillito was shocked at the change in his old squadron commander. Stewart was gray of face, with bags under his eyes and a furrowed brow. His full head of hair had begun to recede and was half silver. Jim had grown so thin that the skin hung from his neck. It was almost as if Jim Stewart had been imprisoned like the others. \u2018He went flak happy there for a while,\u2019 said Shillito. \u2018He wasn\u2019t flying anymore and he was quieter than I remembered.'\u201d\nThe specific claim that Stewart had suffered nightmares about \u201cplanes exploding and men falling through the air screaming\u201d appears to be of dubious origins. It comes from the prologue of Matzen\u2019s book, which is in several places written in an impressionistic style, mixing third-person narration with first-person, stream-of-consciousness prose, the latter a style that does not lend itself well to source-checking. The book reads:\n\u201cIn every newspaper, in every magazine were stories about families who didn\u2019t recognize the boys who had come home. This isn\u2019t my son. This isn\u2019t my husband; this isn\u2019t my brother. He\u2019s so cold, so distant, and the rages, the nightmares!\n\u201cOh yes, the nightmares came every night. There he was on oxygen at 20,000 feet with 190s zipping past, spraying lead and firing rockets, flak bursting about the cockpit. B-24s hit, burning, spinning out of formation. Bail out! Do you see any chutes? How many chutes? Whose ship was it? Oh no, not him! Not them! Bodies, pieces of bodies smacking off the windshield \u2026\u201d\nIn the chapter notes, Matzen wrote the following about the sourcing for the prologue:\n\u201cThe prologue was written last and drew upon all the research that came before. I interviewed dozens of Armed Services personnel about the experience of coming home from wartime and their feelings of unreality and disconnectedness from friends, family and co-workers who couldn\u2019t possibly understand what had happened overseas.\u201d\nIt\u2019s perfectly plausible that Stewart, who led and took part in multiple bombing missions, might have experienced nightmares or had traumatic memories of those difficult experiences. However, the \u201cexploding planes\u201d claim serves as a useful warning about describing what might be a general impression of the collective experience of World War II aviators as a specific experience that Stewart himself personally had.\u00a0\nThe Facebook post\u2019s claim that Stewart was \u201cgrounded for being \u2018flak happy'\u201d is also factually dubious. The broader assertion that Stewart had to fight to be allowed to fly combat missions, and play a more active part in the war, is fully corroborated in two other sources that we consulted: \u201cJimmy Stewart: The Truth Behind the Legend,\u201d a book by the film historian Michael Munn; and \u201cJimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot,\u201d a book by Starr Smith, an author and journalist who worked alongside Stewart as an Eighth Air Force intelligence officer during World War II.\u00a0\nAccording to all three sources, the \u201chigher-ups\u201d within the U.S. military preferred to deploy Stewart\u2019s fame and widespread respect among the American population by using him for propaganda purposes, morale-raising exercises, and to encourage other young men to enlist. However, Stewart was persistent in requesting combat missions, and was eventually stationed in England where he led or took part in 20 bombing missions over Germany.\nNeither Munn nor Smith\u2019s accounts describe Stewart as \u201cflak happy,\u201d \u201cshell-shocked,\u201d or suffering from what would now be diagnosed as PTSD. Neither account describes any nightmares or obvious trauma on Stewart\u2019s part, in detail, and neither book ascribes his supposed condition as the reason he was withdrawn from combat missions towards the end of the war.\u00a0\nRather, according to Smith, Stewart was promoted and moved in the spring of 1944, as part of what Smith describes in his book as a natural progression in his military career, given his frequently commended performance as a bomber pilot and squadron leader:\u00a0\n\u201c\u2026 Toward the end of March [1944], the news came: Major Stewart had been promoted. After flying twelve missions with the 445th Group and commanding the 703rd Squadron, he was leaving to become the operations officer of the 453rd Group, at Attleborough, or Old Buc \u2026 When the appointment was announced, nothing was said about \u201cflying too many missions.\u201d The official word was that the 453rd needed an operations officer, and Major Stewart had been promoted to the job. I was then a combat intelligence officer with the 453rd, and met Stewart for the first time upon his arrival at Old Buc \u2026 Since then, I have been asked many times about it. I must say that I think it highly unlikely that Stewart\u2019s mission schedule and high command\u2019s efforts to \u201cprotect\u201d him had any bearing on his transfer and promotion.\u201d\nSmith speculates, in the book, that Col. Bob Terrill, with whom Stewart had a close affinity, might have lobbied for the transfer, but otherwise describes it as \u201ca routine air force change of assignment,\u201d adding:\n\u201cStewart was a mature, knowledgeable and experienced air force officer with an operational and administrative background. And a stellar combat record. He knew the territory. In short, he was ready for promotion. And deserved it.\u201d\nMatzen\u2019s depiction of Stewart\u2019s state of mind as \u201cflak happy\u201d towards the end of World War II (a depiction reflected in Forney\u2019s viral Facebook post) was relatively thinly sourced, and involved only one direct quotation from a person who met the actor at that time.\u00a0\nBy contrast, two other detailed accounts of Stewart\u2019s World War II service make no mention of his having suffered symptoms equivalent to PTSD, nor claimed that such symptoms were the cause of his being gradually withdrawn from combat missions as the fighting reached its conclusion. One of those accounts was written by an Air Force intelligence officer who worked side-by-side with Stewart between the spring of 1944 and the end of the war.\u00a0\nHowever, we don\u2019t have definitive evidence in either direction. Since \u201cflak happy\u201d is an inherently rather fuzzy description of symptoms, rather than a specific clinical diagnosis, it\u2019s perfectly plausible that Shillito might have seen in Stewart\u2019s demeanor clear signs of the condition (an appraisal he passed on to Matzen) whereas others who encountered him might have come to a completely different conclusion, either due to their own subjective point of view, or because Stewart acted differently around them.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s little doubt that much of the account presented in Forney\u2019s viral Facebook post was accurate. Stewart pushed back against bureaucratic delays and hesitation among military leadership and persistently requested to be allowed to play a more active role in the war effort, rather than being a mere \u201cposter boy.\u201d While stationed in England, he flew and led 20 combat missions over Germany, and received promotions and commendations, in particular for his leadership of those around him. Naturally, he keenly felt any loss of life and later described the fear he routinely felt when embarking on bombing missions.\nHowever, the available evidence is indecisive on the question of whether Stewart was so acutely affected by the horrors of World War II that he suffered nightmares, anxiety, and traumatic memories that would, today, amount to a diagnosis of PTSD. And the available evidence points against any such condition being the reason that he was gradually withdrawn from combat missions.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: Actor Jimmy Stewart suffered what would in 2019 be diagnosed as PTSD due to his experience as a World War II bomber pilot.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In late 2019, readers asked us about blog posts that were widely shared on social media and falsely claimed that the reality television star Duane Chapman, known as \u201cDog the Bounty Hunter,\u201d had died either by suicide or from a pulmonary embolism.\u00a0\nThose reports were false. Beginning on Nov. 20, admirers of Chapman and his late wife, Beth, who died in June after herself being the subject of death hoaxes, began posting tributes to him and sharing one of two blog posts.\u00a0\nThe first purported to be hosted by a website with the domain name whatnow.actual-events.com, but when internet users clicked on the story on social media, they were redirected to the domain newspanel.suzeraincollections.com. There, the story carried the headline \u201cDuane \u2018Dog\u2019 Chapman Died of Pulmonary Embolism. He Didn\u2019t Survive His Second Attack. He Was 66 \u2014 WGN.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe highly dubious website falsely attributed the claim about Chapman\u2019s death to WGN America, a real U.S. television network that broadcast the Chapmans\u2019 most recent reality show \u201cDog\u2019s Most Wanted.\u201d The hoax article also misleadingly used WGN America\u2019s logo in a sharebait video that purported to be a television news report about Chapman\u2019s death, but that paused after a few seconds and required users to share the article on social media in order to continue watching:\n\nIn reality, WGN America had no connection to the story and did not report on Chapman\u2019s death in November 2019, because Chapman did not die in November 2019.\nThe specific claim that Chapman had died from a pulmonary embolism (a blocked artery in the lungs) was rather insidious. At first glance, it appeared especially plausible to many fans of the television star because he was in fact diagnosed with that very problem in September 2019.\nThe second blog post shared by social media users was even more distasteful than the first. It falsely and misleadingly used the logo of BBC News, a highly reputable and widely trusted information source, to report that Chapman had taken his own life.\u00a0\nIn this instance, social media users shared an article that appeared to be hosted on the domain bbc-newsroom.actualeventstv.com, but which redirected to news-room.easystepsdiy.info. On social media, the post carried the headline \u201cDuane \u2018Dog\u2019 Chapman Died of Suicide After Depression Attack on His Sickness \u2014 BBC News\u201d but when users redirected to the source, the article\u2019s headline proclaimed:\n\u201cBreaking: (Actual Suicide Video) Duane \u2018Dog\u2019 Chapman Died of Suicide After Depression Attack on His Sickness \u2014 BBC News.\u201d\nDespite the extremely distasteful claim that the video in the article contained footage of Chapman\u2019s suicide, it contained nothing of the sort and, just as in the first article, the video stopped after a second or two and required viewers to share the post on social media in order to continue watching.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe claim that Chapman had taken his own life was, like the claim he had died of a pulmonary embolism, particularly insidious. In the season finale of \u201cDog\u2019s Most Wanted,\u201d broadcast by WGN America on Nov. 6, Chapman spoke about the recent death of his wife from cancer, and the considerable difficulty he was experiencing in coping with her loss.\u00a0\nAt one moment in the episode, he reportedly discussed how he had contemplated taking his own life, such was his grief. People magazine quoted Chapman as saying:\n\u201cI just hope that I don\u2019t live very much longer without her, because now she made the first step, she\u2019s through the gate,\u201d he added. \u201cShe paved a way for me. I want to take a [god damn] pain pill so bad. I feel like if I did something to myself right now and passed away suicidal and I got to heaven and was like, \u2018Hi honey,\u2019 and would she go, \u2018You [dumb ass], why would you do that?\u2019 Or would she go, \u2018Wow, you\u2019re here.\u2019 I\u2019ll be like \u2018Of course I\u2019m here. You left me. I\u2019m here.\u2019 So, am I obligated to do that?\u201d\u00a0\nBecause of that widely reported revelation, a report that Chapman had died by suicide would have appeared somewhat plausible to many readers.\u00a0\nThe dubious nature of the websites involved, and the absence of any corroborating evidence or reports by actual news organizations, meant that some readers would have immediately recognized the stories as hoaxes. However, a significant number were taken in by them, and shared them on social media, to the extent that Chapman himself intervened.\nHe provided the gossip website TMZ a photograph of himself holding the Nov. 19 edition of the Denver Post, and a handwritten sign that read \u201cI\u2019m alive!\u201d Chapman then posted a screenshot of that article to his own Instagram page the next day.\nIf you need help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In late November 2019, the Alex Jones conspiracy trolling site Infowars posted an article originally published by junk news site Natural News that falsely reported the state of Virginia will consider legislation outlawing martial arts and firearms instruction.\nUnder the headline, \u201cPROPOSED VIRGINIA LAW WOULD OUTLAW KRAV MAGA, BRAZILIAN JIU JITSU, KICKBOXING, TAI CHI, FIREARMS INSTRUCTION AND SELF-DEFENSE TRAINING,\u201d the story reads:\u00a0\nThe law would instantly transform all martial arts instructors into criminal felons. This includes instructors who teach kickboxing, BJJ, Krav Maga, boxing and even Capoeira.\nIt would also criminalize all firearms training classes, including concealed carry classes.\nIt would even criminalize a father teaching his own son how to use a hunting rifle.\nNone of this is true, and oddly enough, the story in question includes not only a link to the bill but copy-and-pasted bill language, so readers can see for themselves that the proposed legislation does not say what Natural News claimed it said.\nVirginia, like nearly all other U.S. states, already had a law on the books restricting unlawful private military-type activity. The current Virginia law renders it a felony if a person:\n1. Teaches or demonstrates to any other person the use, application, or making of any firearm, explosive or incendiary device, or technique capable of causing injury or death to persons, knowing or having reason to know or intending that such training will be employed for use in, or in furtherance of, a civil disorder; or\n2. Assembles with one or more persons for the purpose of training with, practicing with, or being instructed in the use of any firearm, explosive or incendiary device, or technique capable of causing injury or death to persons, intending to employ such training for use in, or in furtherance of, a civil disorder.\nSenate Bill 64 would amend the current law by also making it illegal to, \u201c[Assemble] with one or more persons with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons by drilling, parading, or marching with any firearm, any explosive or incendiary device, or any components or combination thereof.\u201d The amendment makes no mention of martial arts or firearms classes.\nAs the Georgetown Law Institute for Constitutional Law and Protection noted, Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 was the site of deadly violence resulting from a white supremacist rally at which:\nSeveral white nationalist groups arrived outfitted in helmets and matching uniforms and deployed shields, batons, clubs, and flagpoles as weapons in skirmishes with counter-protestors that the instigating groups coordinated under centralized command structures. Meanwhile, private militia groups\u2014many dressed in camouflage fatigues, tactical vests, helmets, and combat boots, and most bearing assault rifles\u2014stood guard as self-designated protectors of the protestors and counter protestors. The heavily armed presence and coordinated paramilitary activities of all of these groups not only increased the prevalence of violence at the rally, but also made it more dangerous for state and local law enforcement to maintain public safety. Moreover, the attire and behavior of some of the self professed militia led to confusion as to who was authorized to lawfully keep the peace.\nAlthough Natural News chalked this amendment up to the fact that voters in November 2019 handed Virginia\u2019s state government over to a Democratic majority for the first time in a generation, that characterization is misleading.\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Louise Lucas, is a Democrat, but Lucas is not part of the new Democratic legislative majority; she assumed her Virginia Senate seat in 1992. Furthermore, as we earlier noted, almost all states in the U.S., with both Democratic and Republican leadership, have some type of law outlawing certain paramilitary activities or at least restricting unauthorized private militias. Virginia\u2019s law predates its new Democratic state majority.\nFinally, the laws don\u2019t make it illegal for martial arts or shooting-range instructors to teach students disciplines like \u201ckrav maga, Brazilian jiu jitsu, kickboxing, tai chi\u201d or \u201cfirearms instruction.\u201d The laws restrict people from various military-like activities that result in violence and civil disorder. The amendment to the Virginia law, specifically, prohibits marching with weapons or explosives for the purpose of intimidation. We therefore rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: A proposed Virginia law would outlaw martial arts and firearms instruction. If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

So when the 86-year-old said in an interview that he quit smoking for health reasons, it prompted some very against-type anxiety among fans.\nIt\u2019s true that Nelson told San Antonio\u2019s KSAT-TV that he stopped smoking weed because he believes smoking has damaged his lungs over the years:\nNelson, 86, said \u201cI have abused my lungs quite a bit in the past, so breathing is a little more difficult these days and I have to be careful.\u201d\n\u201cI started smoking cedar bark, went from that to cigarettes to whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that almost killed me.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t, so he made a decision.\n\u201cI don\u2019t smoke anymore \u2014 take better care of myself,\u201d Nelson said.\nThe news resulted in something of an internet panic.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In December 2019, readers asked us about reports that claimed that Diane Abbott, a prominent Labour MP in the U.K. and the party\u2019s spokesperson on Home Affairs, had posed for photographs on the day of the U.K. general election, wearing two odd shoes, one of which appeared to have been on the wrong foot.\u00a0\nOn Dec. 12, while voting was underway, the Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, Metro UK, and Daily Express published reports including photographs that showed Abbott wearing mismatched shoes \u2014 that is, the shoe on her left foot came from a different pair than the shoe on her right foot. Those articles also claimed that Abbott wore a left-foot shoe on her right foot. The Telegraph wrote that:\n\u201cDiane Abbott went viral on social media today after she was spotted wearing two left shoes from different pairs while canvassing voters. The shadow home secretary was pictured with Meg Hillier, the Labour candidate for Hackney South and Shoreditch, encouraging constituents to support Labour in a now-deleted tweet. The photo quickly went viral online when users spotted Ms Abbott was wearing two black left shoes from different pairs.\u201d\nBased on several photographs posted by different Twitter users including Abbott herself, it\u2019s clear that on Dec. 12, Abbott at several times wore mismatched shoes. Though she also appears to have worn two left shoes, we can\u2019t verify that particular claim definitively.\u00a0\nIn the 24 hours leading up to the 2019 general election on Dec. 12, Abbott canvassed in several London constituencies on behalf of party colleagues standing for election. (In her own constituency of Hackney North and Stoke Newington, Abbott ended up re-elected with a massive majority, winning more than 70 percent of votes, though the Labour Party as a whole lost seats and the Conservative government greatly expanded its parliamentary majority).\u00a0\nAt 8:32 a.m., Abbott posted to Twitter a photograph of herself standing with Labour activists outside Dalston Junction train station in the London borough of Hackney:\nStarting polling day off with a little flash mob in Dalston by some volunteers!\nToday is the day to go and vote!\nYou can find your polling station here\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffehttps://t.co/RQPq7ZI9hO#VoteLabour pic.twitter.com/llCom1BDRH\n\u2014 Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) December 12, 2019\n\nShe wore mismatched shoes in that photograph, and the curve of the shoe on her right foot suggests it was a left-foot shoe, as this magnified version of the photograph shows. However, that curve might simply be a result of Abbott\u2019s stance.\u00a0\n\nAt 9:06 a.m., a Twitter user posted two photographs taken outside Dalston Kingsland train station, again in the borough of Hackney. In one of them, Abbott posed alongside the user, a young boy, and Meg Hillier, Labour candidate for the adjoining constituency of Hackney South and Shoreditch (standing to Abbott\u2019s left in the photograph):\npic.twitter.com/k0hqpbvQ67\n\u2014 anyasizer (@anyasizer) December 12, 2019\n\nIn that photograph, Abbott again wore mismatched shoes. The curve on the right shoe suggests it was intended to be worn on her left foot, but again, we can\u2019t definitively verify that based only on the photograph.\u00a0\n\nAt some point in the morning, likely at the same time Abbott and Hillier were photographed together, Hillier herself posted a photograph to Twitter, which showed just herself and Abbott standing together, again outside Dalston Kingsland train station. The tweet was later deleted, but several Twitter users took screenshots of it:\nFor those claiming the Dianne Abbott tweet is fake it was actually uploaded by @Meg_HillierMP who has now deleted the original.

Although not definitive, the shoe on her right foot again appears to be intended for a left foot.\n\nSome Twitter users argued that the picture posted by Hillier was later altered, and that other photographs taken on Election Day showed that Abbott was, in fact, wearing properly matched shoes. Those arguments were fatally flawed.\nIt\u2019s possible that Hillier\u2019s photograph originally showed Abbott wearing two shoes from the same pair, and that image was later edited by third parties, after Hillier\u2019s tweet was deleted, but this makes no sense. Those doing the editing would merely have been digitally altering Abbott\u2019s right foot in order to make it look exactly as it did in two other photographs \u2014 one posted by a supporter of Abbott\u2019s, and the other posted by Abbott herself.\nAnyone suggesting that all photographs showing Abbott with mismatched shoes were manipulated would, by necessity, have to support a hypothesis in which Abbott herself took the time on Election Day morning to \u2014 for some reason that defies explanation \u2014 arrange for her own photograph of herself, taken at Dalston Junction, to be digitally edited so as to falsely appear as if she were wearing mismatched shoes, and then upload that digitally edited version to Twitter via her Android cellphone at 8:32 a.m.\nThe claim that other photographs taken on Dec. 12 show Abbott with properly matched shoes was inaccurate. One user replied to multiple tweets about Abbott\u2019s shoes, accusing various others of being \u201csheep\u201d and of \u201ccontributing to fake news\u201d and displaying \u201cignorance.\u201d In support of those charges, the user pointed to another photograph of Abbott that showed her wearing properly matched shoes, claiming \u201chere is what she is actually wearing\u201d:\nWhilst not the same photoshopped picture, here is what she is actually wearing\u2026 you are all an embarrassment and exactly what is wrong with the country\u2026 maybe try not being sheep next time? \ud83e\udd14 pic.twitter.com/Bz8W7cNaZe\n\u2014 Bloodshade1234 (@bloodshade1234) December 12, 2019\n\nHowever, that particular photograph could not have been taken on Dec. 12, because Abbott posted it to Twitter on the afternoon of Dec. 11, when it was likely to have been taken:\nI've just been doing some campaigning in Putney for @CllrFleur.\nPutney is a close one and I'm confident we can turn it red tomorrow \ud83c\udf39#GE19 #VoteLabour pic.twitter.com/wVYDV2Ndur\n\u2014 Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) December 11, 2019\n\nThat Twitter user\u2019s claims were therefore inaccurate.\u00a0\nYet another Twitter user posted another photograph of Abbott wearing properly matched shoes, writing: \u201cLooks like Diane Abbott\u2019s shoes are matching here from earlier today\u2026\u201d\nLooks like Diane Abbott's shoes are matching here from earlier today\u2026#GE2019 #DianeAbbott #UKElection pic.twitter.com/UlBBdoijQp\n\u2014 Ryan Farmer (@ryan0_uk) December 12, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that that user and others thought the photograph was taken on Election Day, because Abbott posted it to Twitter at 9 a.m. that morning, along with several others. It shows her canvassing with Marsha de Cordova, Labour\u2019s candidate in the southwest London constituency of Battersea:\nCampaigning for the brilliant Marsha de Cordova #ForTheManyNotTheFew pic.twitter.com/99JSWl64Yk\n\u2014 Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) December 12, 2019\n\nHowever, the photograph in question was actually taken on the previous day, Dec. 11.

One of the shoes might have been required for therapeutic purposes or to aid recovery from an injury, or the mismatch might have been caused by absent-mindedness or the result of an Election Day rush to go canvassing. We invited the Labour Party to provide any relevant information or context, or an explanation for Abbott\u2019s attire in the photographs, but we received no response.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: Diane Abbott was photographed wearing mismatched shoes on Dec. 12, 2019.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: On Dec. 20, 2019, the livestock industry publication Tri-State Livestock News published a wide-ranging screed against the Impossible Whopper, the livestock-free substitute burger sold at Burger King. The author of the article, South Dakota veterinarian James Stangle, made a series of dubious assertions to arrive at the conclusion that four Impossible Whoppers per day contain \u201cenough estrogen to grow boobs on a male.\u201d For several reasons articulated below, this conclusion is flawed.\nStrictly speaking, Impossible Burgers, which use soy as their protein, have no estrogen in them whatsoever. Estrogen refers to a group of sex hormones created by an animal\u2019s endocrine system that affect myriad reproductive and other bodily processes. These chemicals, the most significant of which is estradiol, are not found in any plant-based product, including the soy protein of Impossible Whoppers.\nWhen people express concern about \u201cestrogen\u201d in soy products, they are actually expressing concern about phytoestrogens \u2014 a class of compounds structurally similar to but nonetheless different from estrogens. In soy products, the most relevant chemicals meeting this description are known as isoflavones. Though Stangle devotes ample space to the lesson \u201cnot all proteins are created equal,\u201d he frequently relies on the demonstrably false assumption that phytoestrogens and estrogens are equal in terms of their effect on hormonally mediated processes.\nThis is not the case. Simply put, though phytoestrogens do interact with the human body in ways that disrupt estrogen-controlled processes, their effect in almost all cases is much less pronounced than that of actual estrogens. For this reason, Stangle\u2019s comparison of \u201cestrogen\u201d levels in Impossible Whoppers and birth control pills, which contain synthetic estrogen compounds, is problematic.\nFurther, the comparative relationship between phytoestrogens and estrogens is not simple or linear. The way various phytoestrogens act on a given human body is dependent on a variety of factors, including the amount of estrogen already present in that body. Phytoestrogens also act, at least proportionally, on different receptors than estrogens, and differ in countless other ways. Some phytoestrogens amplify the effects of estrogen, others dampen it.\nThe assertion that soy-based products can lead to female secondary sexual characteristics in males is apparently based on a single 2008 case study in which a Texas man who drank \u201ca daily intake of 3 quarts of soy milk\u201d developed breasts and breast soreness. These symptoms subsided, doctors reported, after he stopped consuming soy. Using a single case report from 2008 to set an empirical threshold for a medical risk is not science but an appeal to fear without context.\nWhile the amount of phytoestrogen in an Impossible Whopper does sound terrifyingly massive when compared to the negligible amount of estrogen in beef, the amount present in the Impossible Whopper is not out of line with phytoestrogen consumption in regions of the world that regularly consume large amounts of soy (and have done so safely for centuries). These billions of people provide strong support for the possibility that the one man in Texas\u2019 potentially soy-induced breasts is \u2014 to say the least \u2014 an outlier.\nFor these reasons, we rank the claim that four Impossible Whoopers a day puts a male at risk of developing breasts as \u201cFalse.\u201d We note, as well, that eating four Impossible Whoppers a day would be roughly as healthy as eating four beef burgers a day: Not healthy at all. Evaluate the following assertion: Four Impossible Whoppers provide \u201cenough estrogen to grow boobs on a male.\u201d  If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

It does not mean to stand with the president.\u201d \u2013 Theodore Roosevelt\nThis format \u2014 a quote pasted on top of a photograph of a famous person \u2014 is frequently used to spread misattributed or completely fabricated quotes. In this case, however, this is a genuine quote from the former president.\nRoosevelt made this remark in an essay entitled \u201cLincoln and Free Speech\u201d that was originally published in Metropolitan Magazine in May 1918. The full essay is available via the HathiTrust Digital Library.\u00a0 A screenshot showing the beginning of this essay (the viral comment is made in the opening paragraph) can be seen below:\n\nWhile the viral quote is correctly attributed to Roosevelt, it is a bit shorter than the original passage. Here\u2019s the full text of Roosevelt\u2019s opening paragraph in his essay \u201cLincoln and Free Speech.\u201d\nPatriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the President or any other public official save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him in so far as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth \u2014 whether about the President or about anyone else \u2014 save in the rare cases where this would make known to the enemy information of military value which would otherwise be unknown to him.\u00a0\nThis essay was published in 1918 toward the end of World War I. Roosevelt, who served as the 26th president of the United States between 1901 and 1909, was critical of President Woodrow Wilson for his reluctance to bring the U.S. into the war.\u00a0\nRoosevelt also criticized the Wilson administration for playing partisan politics, suppressing critical voices, and for its \u201clargely successful effort to break down freedom of speech and freedom of the press by government action.\u201d Roosevelt elaborated a bit on why he penned this essay in his book, \u201cThe Great Adventure: Present-day Studies in American Nationalism\u201c:\nThe simple truth is that never in our history has any other administration during a great war played politics of the narrowest personal and partisan type as President Wilson has done; and one of the features of this effort has been the careful and studied effort to mislead and misinform the public through information sedulously and copiously furnished them by government officials. An even worse feature has been the largely successful effort to break down freedom of speech and the freedom of the press by government action. Much of this action has been taken under the guise of attacking disloyalty; but it has represented action, not against those who were disloyal to the nation, but against those who disagreed with or criticized the President for failure in the performance of duty to the nation.\nThe action of the government against real traitors, and against German spies and agents, has been singularly weak and ineffective. The chief of the Secret Service said that there were a quarter of a million German spies in this country. Senator Overmann put the number at a larger figure; but not one has been shot or hung, and relatively few have been interfered with in any way. The real vigor of the administration has been directed against honest critics who have endeavored to force it to speed up the war and to act with prompt efficiency against Germany. In my letter to Senator Poindexter I quoted an article I had written which appeared in the Metropolitan Magazine for April, 1918.\u00a0\nIn short, this viral quote \u2014 \u201cPatriotism means to stand with the country. It does not mean to stand with the president\u201d \u2014 was truly written by Roosevelt. It is also an idea that Roosevelt frequently expressed. In November 2016, we were asked about a similar quote that was ostensibly uttered by the 26th president:\n\u201cTo announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.\u201d\nThis, too, is a genuine quote from Roosevelt.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt once said, \"Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president.\" If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

In ensuing years, events such as the publication of multiple books by and about him, the success of the television show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and his entry into U.S. politics would multiply his level of national (and international) fame many times over.\nBut perhaps the single thing Donald Trump was most famous for at the beginning of the 1990s was his messy divorce from his first wife Ivana, which played out across the headlines of New York tabloids. Amid Ivana\u2019s claims of \u201ccruel and inhuman treatment\u201d at the hands of Donald, and Ivana\u2019s accusations that Donald had raped her and pulled out her hair by the handful, the couple eventually reached a divorce settlement that reportedly left Trump\u2019s ex-wife with anywhere from $14 million to $25 million.\nAgainst the backdrop of this very public divorce, the August 1990 issue of Playgirl magazine (a publication intended to emulate the success of Playboy magazine but with a female audience) teased its readers with a cover blurb that stated \u201cSleep with Donald Trump\u201d:\n\nThe magazine\u2019s table of contents offered a blurb for the \u201cSleep with Donald Trump\u201d contest that proclaimed: \u201cHe\u2019s rich, almost single and yours for the asking.

As is typical for this type of \u201carmageddon\u201d rumor, fears about this doomsday event were overblown and largely based on fear-mongering headlines:\nInternational Business (IBT) Times published an article headlined: \u201cLargest Planet-Killer Asteroid To Approach Earth This Month Arriving On Saturday.\u201d\nThe Express claimed: \u201cNASA asteroid alert: Radars track a 20,000MPH space rock on \u2018close approach\u2019 this weekend.\u201d\nAll of these articles are somewhat based in reality. NASA monitors the skies for NEOs (near-earth objects), and a large asteroid was indeed approaching earth in February 2020. However, these articles led many people to believe their lives were in danger, and that the asteroid was expected to hit earth. But that simply isn\u2019t the case.\u00a0\nWhile these articles spend time talking about what would happen if a large asteroid actually made impact with the earth (complete with pictures of cinematic doomsday events), they all concede in their concluding paragraphs that this asteroid (asteroid 163373 or 2002 PZ39) won\u2019t come within 3 million miles of earth.\u00a0\nIBT writes (emphasis ours): \u201cAccording to [NASA\u2019s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies], 163373 (2002 PZ39)\u2019s near-Earth intersection will happen on Feb. 15 at 6:05 a.m. EST. During this time, the asteroid will pass over the planet from a distance of 0.03860 astronomical units or around 3.6 million miles away.\u201d\nNASA confirmed this to us in a statement, writing:\n\u201cThe trajectory of asteroid 2002 PZ39 is very well known. It will pass by Earth at a distance of about 5.77 million kilometers (approximately 3.59 million miles). The asteroid will approach no closer than about 15 times the distance of the Moon.\u201d\nThe Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) is constantly monitoring the skies for potentially dangerous asteroids. In fact, CNEOS currently lists about 20 asteroids that will pass safely by earth over the next month. Only one, a relatively small asteroid with an estimated diameter of about of 50 meters called asteroid 2018 GY, is expected to come within 1 million miles of earth.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a little more information about near-earth objects from CNEOS (emphasis ours):\u00a0\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth\u2019s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth\u2019s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.\nWith an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth\u2019s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth\u2019s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth\u2019s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories \u2026\n\u2026 No one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.\nThis is hardly the first time we\u2019ve received questions about a potential \u201cearth-killing\u201d asteroid. In fact, we\u2019ve been investigating rumors about doomsday asteroids since at least 2015. These fear-inducing reports have all come and gone without incident, and we expect that asteroid 2002 PZ39 will do the same.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: An asteroid is expected to hit earth in mid-February 2020.

Charles Sumner. The incident was highlighted in the aftermath of President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 State of the Union address and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s much-discussed ripping up of her copy of the president\u2019s speech.\u00a0\nOn Feb. 4, 2020, shortly after the State of the Union, right-leaning journalist Ian Miles Cheong posted a short clip of Pelosi tearing a copy of the speech, describing it as \u201cthe most classless act ever conducted in Congress.\u201d\nSeveral users countered this assertion by pointing to an 1856 incident in which the pro-slavery U.S. Rep. Preston Brooks \u201cbeat a senator nearly to death\u201d on the floor of the U.S. Senate:\nin 1856 congressman Preston Brooks beat a senator nearly to death for criticizing slavery https://t.co/bPrQDPRPlX\n\u2014 nick (@nick_lyle) February 5, 2020\n\nOn Facebook, some users also highlighted the Brooks-Sumner affair as a riposte to claims that Pelosi\u2019s speech-ripping was unprecedentedly aggressive.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe claim that in 1856 a congressman (Brooks) viciously attacked a senator (Sumner) with a cane on the floor of the U.S. Senate was accurate and is a matter of historical record.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s how the website of the U.S. Senate describes the infamous attack:\nOn May 22, 1856, the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest deliberative body\u201d became a combat zone. In one of the most dramatic and deeply ominous moments in the Senate\u2019s entire history, a member of the House of Representatives entered the Senate Chamber and savagely beat a senator into unconsciousness.\nThe inspiration for this clash came three days earlier when Senator Charles Sumner, a Massachusetts antislavery Republican, addressed the Senate on the explosive issue of whether Kansas should be admitted to the Union as a slave state or a free state. In his \u201cCrime Against Kansas\u201d speech, Sumner identified two Democratic senators as the principal culprits in this crime\u2014Stephen Douglas of Illinois and Andrew Butler of South Carolina.\nHe characterized Douglas to his face as a \u201cnoise-some, squat, and nameless animal . . . not a proper model for an American senator.\u201d Andrew Butler, who was not present, received more elaborate treatment. Mocking the South Carolina senator\u2019s stance as a man of chivalry, the Massachusetts senator charged him with taking \u201ca mistress . . . who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight\u2014I mean,\u201d added Sumner, \u201cthe harlot, Slavery.\u201d\nRepresentative Preston Brooks was Butler\u2019s South Carolina kinsman. If he had believed Sumner to be a gentleman, he might have challenged him to a duel. Instead, he chose a light cane of the type used to discipline unruly dogs. Shortly after the Senate had adjourned for the day, Brooks entered the old chamber, where he found Sumner busily attaching his postal frank to copies of his \u201cCrime Against Kansas\u201d speech.\nMoving quickly, Brooks slammed his metal-topped cane onto the unsuspecting Sumner\u2019s head. As Brooks struck again and again, Sumner rose and lurched blindly about the chamber, futilely attempting to protect himself. After a very long minute, it ended.\nThe attack provoked a storm of controversy, press coverage, and a Senate investigation. It was immortalized in several prints, including the one shown below, which was produced by John Henry Bufford and shows Brooks to the right brandishing his cane over the head of an unsuspecting Sumner, with Brooks\u2019 fellow South Carolina Congressman Laurence Keitt keeping would-be defenders of Sumner at bay:\nAccording to the findings of that investigation, Brooks was unrepentant about his assault on Sumner, reportedly saying:\n\u201cToday I approached [Sumner], after the Senate adjourned, and said to him, \u2018Mr. Sumner, I have read your speech carefully, and with as much calmness as I could be expected to read such a speech. You have libelled my state [South Carolina] and slandered my relation [Andrew Butler], who is aged and absent, and I feel it to be my duty to punish you for it.\u2019 And with that I struck him a blow across the head with my cane, and repeated it until I was satisfied [\u2026].\u201d\u00a0 Sumner\u2019s \u201cCrime Against Kansas\u201d speech can be read in full here.\u00a0\nThe House failed to garner the necessary two-thirds vote to expel Brooks, but it successfully censured Keitt. According to the House\u2019s website, both men resigned in protest at what they perceived to be unfair treatment by their congressional colleagues, and they subsequently won back their seats in the special elections triggered by their resignations. Brooks died just months later in January 1857.\nFor his part, Sumner was so badly injured in the beating that he took three years to recover, but he went on to serve in the Senate until his death in 1874.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: In 1856 U.S. House Rep. Preston Brooks brutally attacked Sen. Charles Sumner with a cane in the U.S. Senate chamber.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: On Jan. 28, 2020, Harvard professor Charles Lieber was arrested and charged with making a materially false statement to federal authorities about receiving funding from China.\nLieber\u2019s arrest was big news in academic circles; but after internet users noticed that the alleged funding was coming from a university in Wuhan, China, the center of an outbreak of a new coronavirus, wild speculation went viral and unfounded connections were drawn between Lieber and a conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was a lab-made bioweapon.\u00a0\n   \nA viral Facebook post took it further, relaying more details about Lieber\u2019s arrest and making use of some conveniently placed scare quotes:\nIn case you missed it, today, Federal Agents arrested Dr. Charles Lieber, chair of Harvard University\u2019s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, with lying to the Department of Defense about secret monthly payments of $50,000.00 paid by China and receipt of millions more to help set up a chemical/biological \u201cResearch\u201d laboratory in China. Also arrested were two Chinese \u201cStudents\u201d working as research assistants, one of whom was actually a lieutenant in the Chinese Army, the other captured at Logan Airport as he tried to catch a flight to China \u2013 smuggling 21 vials of \u201cSensitive Biological Samples\u201d according to the FBI.\nOh, almost forgot. The research lab the good professor had helped set up? It\u2019s located at the Wuhan University of Technology. Wuhan China is ground zero to the potentially global pandemic known as the \u201cCoronavirus\u201dwhich is both spreading rapidly and killing people.\nThis is Stephen Coonts international spy novel stuff happening in real life \u2013 and it has barely made the news.\nThe claims made in this Facebook post are generally true. Lieber was truly arrested in January 2020 for lying to federal agents about funding he had allegedly received from China. However, Lieber\u2019s arrest was not connected to the coronavirus and there\u2019s no evidence to support claims that this disease was a human-made bioweapon.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look and separate the facts from the rumors in this case.\nIn short: Lieber was arrested for lying to authorities about his involvement with a Chinese government program to recruit and cultivate scientific talent.\u00a0\nLieber was the Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University and the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group. Because this group had received grant funding from National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Defense (DOD), Lieber was required to disclose any funding he received from foreign governments or entities that could lead to a conflict of interest.\u00a0\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges in its complaint that Lieber became a \u201cstrategic scientist\u201d at Wuhan University in 2011 and that he was a contractual participant in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan, a government program aimed at recruiting and cultivating high-level scientific talent.\nThe DOJ says that Lieber was arrested for lying to investigators about his involvement in this program and his affiliations with WUT:\nChina\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese Talent recruit plans that are designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China\u2019s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security. These talent programs seek to lure Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information. Under the terms of Lieber\u2019s three-year Thousand Talents contract, WUT paid Lieber $50,000 USD per month, living expenses of up to 1,000,000 Chinese Yuan (approximately $158,000 USD at the time) and awarded him more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at WUT. In return, Lieber was obligated to work for WUT \u201cnot less than nine months a year\u201d by \u201cdeclaring international cooperation projects, cultivating young teachers and Ph.D. students, organizing international conference[s], applying for patents and publishing articles in the name of\u201d WUT.\nThe complaint alleges that in 2018 and 2019, Lieber lied about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and affiliation with WUT. On or about, April 24, 2018, during an interview with investigators, Lieber stated that he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program, but he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure\u201d how China categorized him. In November 2018, NIH inquired of Harvard whether Lieber had failed to disclose his then-suspected relationship with WUT and China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan. Lieber caused Harvard to falsely tell NIH that Lieber \u201chad no formal association with WUT\u201d after 2012, that \u201cWUT continued to falsely exaggerate\u201d his involvement with WUT in subsequent years, and that Lieber \u201cis not and has never been a participant in\u201d China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan.\nIn short: The DOJ announced three separate arrests in January 2020. The first was Lieber. The second involved Yanqing Ye, a lieutenant in the Chinese army accused of stealing U.S. research. And third was Zaosong Zheng, who stole 21 vials of biological research. While these three arrests all involve people lying about their ties to China, they took place at different universities and are not related.\u00a0\nOn Jan. 28, 2020, the DOJ announced the arrests of three different individuals in three separate cases related to China.\u00a0\nDr. Charles Lieber, 60, Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, was arrested this morning and charged by criminal complaint with one count of making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement. Lieber will appear this afternoon before Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts.\nYanqing Ye, 29, a Chinese national, was charged in an indictment today with one count each of visa fraud, making false statements, acting as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy. Ye is currently in China.\nZaosong Zheng, 30, a Chinese national, was arrested on Dec. 10, 2019, at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport and charged by criminal complaint with attempting to smuggle 21 vials of biological research to China. On Jan. 21, 2020, Zheng was indicted on one count of smuggling goods from the United States and one count of making false, fictitious or fraudulent statements. He has been detained since Dec. 30, 2019.\nYanqinq Ye, a lieutenant of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the armed forces of the People\u2019s Republic of China and member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), reportedly lied about being a \u201cstudent\u201d on her visa in order to attend Boston University. The DOJ alleges that Ye conducted research and assessed military websites while studying at BU\u2019s Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering and sent U.S. documents and information to China.\nZaosong Zheng was arrested at Logan Airport as he was attempting to smuggle 21 vials of biological research that he allegedly stole from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\u00a0\nIn short: Cancer cells.\u00a0\nAs news of Zheng\u2019s arrest circulated on social media, some made the unfounded claim that these vials of \u201cbiological research\u201d were somehow connected to the coronavirus. According to The New York Times, however, these vials contained cancer cells:\nInside his checked luggage, wrapped in a plastic bag and then inserted into a sock, the officers found what they were looking for: 21 vials of brown liquid \u2014 cancer cells \u2014 that the authorities say Mr. Zheng, 29, a cancer researcher, took from a laboratory at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\nWhile some conspiracy theorists assumed that Zheng\u2019s plan involved a bio-weapon, Zheng told authorities that he planned on using the samples to further his career:\nUnder questioning, court documents say, Mr. Zheng acknowledged that he had stolen eight of the samples and had replicated 11 more based on a colleague\u2019s research. When he returned to China, he said, he would take the samples to Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital and turbocharge his career by publishing the results in China, under his own name.\nIn short: There is no evidence that coronavirus was human-made and several leading researchers have debunked this notion.\u00a0\nWhile this conspiracy theory has started to receive some mainstream attention (it was even pushed by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton), there is no evidence to support this claim.\u00a0\nIn fact, several researchers have debunked this claim, calling it illogical and noting that the current evidence indicates that the coronavirus mutated naturally.\nTrevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle stated at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Seattle that \u201cThere is no evidence whatsoever of genetic engineering that we can find. The evidence we have is that the mutations [in the virus] are completely consistent with natural evolution.\u201d\nTwo more researchers gave statements to The Washington Post:\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered,\u201d said Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University. \u201cThe possibility this was a deliberately released bioweapon can be firmly excluded.\u201d\nVipin Narang, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it is \u201chighly unlikely\u201d the general population was exposed to a virus through an accident at a lab.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any evidence for that,\u201d said Narang, a political science professor with a background in chemical engineering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a skip in logic to say it\u2019s a bioweapon that the Chinese developed and intentionally deployed, or even unintentionally deployed,\u201d Narang said\nIn short: No. Lieber\u2019s arrest (as well as the two other cases) was related to economic and academic espionage. There\u2019s no indication that Lieber\u2019s research, arrest, or connection to China was related to the spread of the coronavirus.\nLieber was arrested in January 2020 for allegedly working with a university in China to further the country\u2019s recruitment and development of scientific talent. While Lieber was reportedly working with a lab in Wuhan, China (it should be noted that Lieber allegedly started working with the Wuhan University of Technology 9 years before there would be an outbreak of coronavirus in the area), there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that this is anything more than a coincidence.\u00a0\nLieber\u2019s arrest, as well as the two other cases brought by the DOJ in January 2020, dealt with an academic battle between the U.S. and China. Lieber was allegedly working with a Chinese recruitment program, Ye was allegedly attempting to steal United States research and documents, and Zheng\u2019s was attempting to steal biological samples.\nFBI Boston Division Special Agent in Charge Joseph R. Bonavolonta said in a statement that all three of these cases dealt with \u201ceconomic espionage\u201d and China\u2019s attempts to steal trade secrets:\nChina\u2019s goal, simply put, is to replace the United States as the world\u2019s leading superpower, and they\u2019re breaking the law to get there.\nMassachusetts is a target-rich environment with world-class academic institutions, research facilities, hospitals, cleared defense contractors, and start-ups. And each and every one of them are in danger of having their research, development, and investments stolen right out from under them.\nThe ruling Communist Party of the PRC wants what we have so they can get the upper hand on us.\nAnd while we are still confronted with traditional spies seeking our state secrets, often working under diplomatic cover, or posing as everyday citizens, I can tell you China is also using what we call \u201cnon-traditional collectors\u201d such as professors, researchers, hackers and front companies.\nAll three individuals charged today are manifestations of the China threat \u2026\nMake no mistake, the ruling Communist Party of the People\u2019s Republic of China is highly strategic in their approach, and we are deeply concerned about American innovation, research, and cutting-edge technologies ending up in the wrong hands \u2026\nEconomic espionage and the theft of trade secrets significantly hurts our academic institutions, businesses, jobs, and consumers, resulting in hundreds of billions of dollars in losses every year.\nWhile some may find these arrests to be suspect, the Department of Justice made no mention of coronavirus or biological warfare in their complaints. Evaluate the following assertion: Harvard professor Charles Lieber was arrested for concealing funding from a Chinese lab connected to the origin of the new coronavirus.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: A 2020 outbreak of COVID-19, caused by a new coronavirus, stirred up plenty of fears, concerns, and conspiracy theories on the internet. One of the most prominent (and unfounded) theories alleged that coronavirus was created in a government lab as a bioweapon and then released on the people of China. There is no evidence to support this claim and several researchers have disputed this theory as illogical.\nStill, that hasn\u2019t stopped the rumor from spreading. In February 2020 the website The UFO Spotlight On\u2026 published an article revealing the \u201ctruth\u201d about the disease:\nI am a senior Chinese military intelligence officer and I know the truth about the \u201ccorona virus\u201d outbreak. It is far worse than the media are telling you.\n[\u2026]\nI have information that I believe could lead to the overthrow of my government. It is also relevant to billions of people outside of China, all of whom are now in existential peril.\n[\u2026]\nBy now you will be familiar with the recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV, also known as NCP, or simply \u201ccoronavirus\u201d. You will have heard that it originated in Wuhan, an industrial city in China, and that it came from an animal \u2014 most likely a bat or a pangolin \u2014 that was sold in a wild animal market. You will have been told that it is an influenza-like illness that can in severe cases cause pneumonia, respiratory failure and death.\nFinally, you may have heard that although the disease is highly infectious, it is dangerous only to the elderly or to those who have a compromised immune system. The official lethality rate is approximately 2% or so.\nAll of that is a bunch of lies concocted by the Chinese state with the tacit support of the U.S. deep state and its friends in the European Union, Russia and Australia, and spread by the docile media in all of those countries.\nThe article went on to claim that China, unhappy with massive protests erupting in Hong Kong, decided to make a biological agent that could make protesters more docile. This bioweapon, the article claims, proved to be more deadly than intended and resulted in the deaths of many people. China decided that the program was too dangerous (the author of the article writes \u201cwe wanted the population of Hong Kong to submit to us; we did not want to exterminate it\u201d) and stopped using the bioweapon. But the United States, according to the article, realized the power of this weapon and wanted it for their own. A deal was set up for the U.S. to acquire the bioweapon, but before the exchange could happen a group of Chinese agents, the author included, rushed in to stop the deal. This resulted in a shootout, the article claims, which led the bioweapon to be accidentally released near Wuhan, China.\nIf that all sounds like a fantastical bit of fiction fit for a spy novel or a horror movie, that\u2019s because it is. This story was originally published on r/NoSleep, a section of Reddit dedicated to scary fiction stories. The story on The UFO Spotlight On\u2026 did contain a link back to the original author. However, this link may have been hard for some readers to find as it was written in Chinese.\u00a0\nPosts on r/NoSleep are designed to be realistic horror stories and the commentators often treat them as if they were real.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a fake news detection task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In February 2020, as fears of a world-wide COVID-19 pandemic caused by a new coronavirus from China spread across the globe, many Western news outlets began running stories suggesting that consumers were shunning the popular Mexican brand of beer called Corona due to their mistakenly connecting it with the coronavirus.\nTake, for example, the following article, whose headline and subhead misleadingly implied that the Corona brand had experienced a steep drop-off in sales because potential buyers were being scared off by its putative link to the coronavirus:\n\nHowever, what the text of the article actually reported was not that consumers had suddenly become \u201cafraid\u201d of Corona beer, but that multiple brands of beer (not just Corona) were experiencing relative sales slumps in China because the spread of the coronavirus had generally dampened public activities there, at a time of year (i.e., during Chinese New Year celebrations) when sales were typically high:\nThe world\u2019s biggest brewing giant, which is behind the Corona, Budweiser and Stella Artois brands, forecast first quarter earnings will tumble by about 10% after the virus outbreak saw demand slump in China as it also coincided with the Chinese New Year, sending its shares 8% lower.\nAB InBev estimates the earnings hit across China after seeing around \u00a3221 million of lost sales in the first two months of 2020 alone due to coronavirus \u2013 also known as Covid-19. The Belgium-based group said: \u201cThe impact of the Covid-19 virus outbreak on our business continues to evolve.\n\u201cThe outbreak has led to a significant decline in demand in China in both on-premise and in-home channels. Additionally, demand during the Chinese New Year was lower than in previous years as it coincided with the beginning of this outbreak.\u201d\nBut the trope that \u201cpeople are so dumb they\u2019re shunning Corona beer because they think it\u2019s connected to the coronavirus\u201d was too tempting for many news outlets to eschew, even though little or no evidence backed it up. Many of them based their articles on a survey that supposedly documented that \u201c38% of Beer-Drinking Americans Wouldn\u2019t Buy Corona Now,\u201d again suggesting people were being scared off the brand due to mistaken associations between the name of the brand and a virus.\nHowever, that poll was conducted and published by the 5W public relations firm, and it did not find what many news reports gleefully claimed it did. The PR piece stated that a phone survey of 737 American beer drinkers had determined that \u201c38% of Americans would not buy Corona under any circumstances now,\u201d and by offering that statistic in conjunction with other information about the coronavirus, the piece again misleadingly suggested that consumers were being frightened away from Corona beer merely because of its name. But it didn\u2019t provide readers with the questions that the poll\u2019s subjects were asked, nor did it offer any context explaining why respondents answered the way they did. Or, as The Atlantic noted of the issue:\nBy presenting this finding in the context of other questions that are explicitly about the coronavirus, the press release creates the impression that Americans\u2019 reluctance to drink the beer is due to the coronavirus. \u201cThere is no question that Corona beer is suffering because of the coronavirus,\u201d Ronn Torossian, the CEO of 5WPR, says in the press release. \u201cCould one imagine walking into a bar and saying \u2018Hey, can I have a Corona?\u2019 or \u2018Pass me a Corona.\u2019\u201d\nBut this connection is manufactured, and Torossian is ignoring far more mundane reasons Americans might not buy a Corona, including that they don\u2019t like the taste. Of those Americans who did report regularly drinking Corona, only 4 percent said they would now stop drinking the beer.\nA number of major news outlets appear to have walked right into the trap. Because they did not understand that the original press release was walking a fine line between deeply misleading claims and outright lies, their articles have inadvertently fallen on the side of the lie. As a viral tweet by CNN put it, the survey supposedly found that 38 percent of Americans would not drink Corona, \u201cbecause of the coronavirus.\u201d\nHuffington Post did obtain a list of the questions that were put to the poll\u2019s respondents and observed how the results could be used to create misleading impressions:\nHere are the questions that were asked, according to The Dispatch\u2019s Declan Garvey, combined with the results 5WPR chose to include in its press release:\nAre you a beer drinker?\nAre you a Corona drinker?\nIs Corona related to the coronavirus? (16% of beer-drinkers were \u201cconfused\u201d about this.)\nIn light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona? (4% who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d said they planned to stop.)\nWould you buy Corona in a store?\nWould you order a Corona in a restaurant/bar/public venue? (14% who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d said they would not.)\nWould you buy Corona under any circumstances now? (38% of \u201cbeer-drinking Americans\u201d said they would not.)\nThere are any number of ways a careful market researcher might attempt to tease out how, if at all, coronavirus has affected perceptions of the beer. This isn\u2019t one of them. Instead, these questions manage to fail simultaneously in two different directions. On one hand, some of the phrasing (\u201cIn light of the coronavirus \u2026\u201d) implies a queasy connection between the virus and the beer that people might not have considered until they were polled.\nOn the other hand, the final three questions \u2015 including the one responsible for that startling 38% statistic \u2015 don\u2019t explicitly mention coronavirus as a motivation at all. In other words, drinkers who said they wouldn\u2019t buy Corona might simply have meant that they prefer to order a different brand of beer.\nThe much less eye-catching but entirely more plausible statistic is that, even \u201cin light of the coronavirus,\u201d just 4% of Americans who \u201cusually drink Corona\u201d say they \u201cplan to stop\u201d drinking it. Even here, the framing of the question is sloppy: If respondents \u201cplan to stop,\u201d doesn\u2019t that imply they haven\u2019t given it up yet?\nA different poll by YouGov reported that \u201cCorona\u2019s Buzz score \u2014 a net score based on whether US adults have heard anything negative or positive about the brand\u201d had decreased sharply since the beginning of January 2020, and that \u201cpurchase intent for the brand is at the lowest it\u2019s been in two years.\u201d But again, the poll didn\u2019t document any actual decrease in Corona sales due to consumer confusion over a supposed link between the beer and the virus.\nIn fact, CNN reported that Constellation Brands, Corona\u2019s producer, had reported an uptick in sales of the Corona Extra brand in the U.S.:\nConstellation Brands (STZ), which brews several variations of the popular lager, said in a statement that its customers \u201cunderstand there is no link between the virus and our business.\u201d\n\u201cSales of Corona remain very strong and we appreciate the continued support from our fans,\u201d Constellation Brands spokesperson Stephanie McGuane told CNN Business. \u201cOur advertising with Corona is consistent with the campaign we have been running for the last 30 years and is based off strong consumer sentiment.\u201d\nConstellation said Corona Extra sales grew 5% in the United States in the four weeks that ended February 16. That\u2019s nearly double the trend of the past 52 weeks. Corona\u2019s sales are heavily dependent on the US market, unlike some of its far-more-international rivals.\nReuters similarly reported Constellation Brands as declaring that \u201call units supporting its beer business are seeing positive sales trends for the brand thus far in 2020 despite claims about the impact of the coronavirus on its business.\u201d\nNonetheless, the trope that \u201cpeople are dumb enough to believe you can get the coronavirus by drinking Corona beer\u201d caught on with the press because, as legends often do, it validated something many readers were willing to believe, according to the Atlantic:\nThe real question is why this obscure poll would, even if it had been true, be able to capture the imagination of so many people. And the answer is as obvious as it is saddening: Clearly, a lot of Americans already think that their fellow citizens are stupid. The real reason a fake finding could have spread so far so quickly is that it confirmed prejudices about the world that many have held all along. Evaluate the following assertion: Sales of Corona beer dropped sharply in early 2020 because consumers mistakenly associated the brand name with the new coronavirus.

She gained notoriety for her claims that she could predict the future and communicate with spirits. But she was also the subject of criticism for offering the grieving parents of missing children false information.\nBrowne did vaguely write in her 2008 book that a respiratory illness would spread across the globe in 2020. Here are her own words from the Google Books version of \u201cEnd of Days\u201d:\nIn around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments. Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely.\nAlthough the term \u201cprediction\u201d is a subjective one, it may come as no surprise that Browne claimed to have foreseen an international respiratory disease outbreak, considering that the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak of the early 2000s occurred before her book was published.\nThe term \u201csevere\u201d would certainly apply to some cases of COVID-19, the coronavirus disease, which has been deadly for thousands of patients in 2020. The illness appears to be more lethal than the seasonal flu, though some of the cases are quite mild or asymptomatic.\nFinally, it would be subjective to describe the coronavirus as \u201cbaffling.\u201d Coronavirus infections are not new, although COVID-19 is a new strain, and because of that, no vaccines or therapeutic treatments exist yet to fight it. And of course no evidence exists that COVID-19 will \u201csuddenly vanish.\u201d In fact health professionals have stated it might become a seasonal illness.\nWe therefore rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d Although it could be argued that stating a respiratory illness would sweep through the world in 2020 was accurate, other elements of the book passage are unknown or unlikely, and of course \u201cpredicting\u201d a worldwide outbreak of a respiratory illness when one has already happened could be more a matter of lucky guessing than predicting.

And that record haunts him in his bid to secure the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\nIn early March 2020, readers asked Snopes to verify a quote in 1977 in which Biden, then a U.S. senator representing Delaware, allegedly expressed fear that desegregation, if not done in an \u201corderly\u201d way, could result in his children growing up in \u201ca racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point.\u201d\nThe quote was initially uncovered by Daria Roithmayr, a law professor at the University of Southern California (USC), in July 2019. But as Biden emerged from Super Tuesday on March 3, 2020, as a potential front-runner for the nomination, news stories containing the quote circulated anew.\nAmong stories readers widely shared was a July 15, 2019, Business Insider story that reported, \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden is facing increased scrutiny over his record on busing and racial issues, and this week old comments resurfaced in which he said, in 1977, that busing for the purpose of desegregation would cause his children to \u2018grow up in a racial jungle.\nThe quote is accurate as reported and reads in full:\nUnless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point. We have got to make some move on this.\nWe contacted the Biden campaign for comment but received no response in time for publication.\nBiden made the remark in 1977 during a hearing about busing school children in order to desegregate public schools. As The New York Times reported in a detailed delineation of Biden\u2019s history with busing, Biden at the time had emerged as the Democratic party\u2019s crusader against busing, taking the same side as segregationists. Biden \u201cjoined up with Jesse Helms, the segregationist senator from North Carolina, to offer his own anti-busing amendment to that year\u2019s education spending bill.\u201d Biden\u2019s \u201cadvocacy made it safe for other Democrats to oppose busing,\u201d The Times reported.\nThe Times further reported that Biden sided with Helms in 1975 when the latter proposed to strip the federal government\u2019s power to withhold funding from school districts that refused to comply with racial-equality measures:\nUnder the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare had a powerful tool to fight school segregation: It could withhold funding from districts that refused to integrate \u2014 and integration effectively meant busing. Mr. Helms wanted to strip the agency of that power.\nAs Mr. Biden rose on the Senate floor in September 1975 to embrace that approach, Mr. Helms wryly welcomed him \u201cto the ranks of the enlightened.\u201d Mr. Biden objected to the education department mandating desegregation absent a court order, and warned of white flight to the suburbs and even racial unrest. \u2026 Mr. Helms\u2019s amendment, which would have also barred the education department from collecting data about the race of students or teachers, failed. But a slightly narrower measure written by Mr. Biden, which prevented schools from using federal dollars to assign teachers or students by race, passed, 50-43.\nRoithmayr told us via email that busing, along with affirmative action, were viewed by those trying to achieve desegregation of schools after Brown v. Board of Education as effective tools. That was \u201cbecause they were linked to the possibility of \u2018big structural change,\u2019 change that didn\u2019t require bigger overhaul, like desegregating cities and restructuring financing for public school education. I suppose expediency is one way to describe it, but effective and pragmatic might be another way.\u201d\nBecause Biden made the remark about a \u201cracial jungle,\u201d we rate this claim as a \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden once said he didn't want his kids to grow up in a \"racial jungle\" in regards to desegregation.

We remind you that the treatment of a poorly tolerated fever or pain in the context of COVID19 or any other respiratory virosis is based on paracetamol, without exceeding the dose of 60 mg/kg/day and 3g/day. NSAIDs should be banned.\nCOVID-19 \u2014 Taking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone, \u2026) could be a factor in worsening the infection. If you have a fever, take paracetamol [also known as acetaminophen]. If you are already on anti-inflammatory drugs or in doubt, ask your doctor for advice.\nDr. Amir Khan, a National Health Service (NHS) doctor and a senior university lecturer in the U.K., offered the following explanation about why taking anti-inflammatory drugs might have a deleterious effect on persons dealing with a COVID-19 infection:\nDespite all of their beneficial effects, it has long been known that anti-inflammatories can have a depressive effect on parts of our immune systems.\nWhen it comes to taking them to help ease the symptoms of the common cold, we do not really have to worry about this slight but important reduction in the strength of our immune systems: We are very unlikely to develop complications from the common cold, let alone die from it.\nBut we need our immune system in top working order in order to battle the coronavirus and win.\nWhen the virus enters the human body, it induces mild to severe respiratory problems, a high fever, cough and, potentially, multi-organ dysfunction, which can lead to death.\nAn early part of our body\u2019s immune response to a virus of this sort is to release cells called mast cells, which form our first line of defense against the virus.\nThese [mast cells] are released very quickly from our respiratory tract \u2014 the nasal passageway and linings of the lungs.\nWhen the mast cells come into contact with the virus, they then trigger a much bigger immune response, which involves inflammatory chemicals being released.\nWe need these inflammatory chemicals to help tackle the virus in the medium to long term. It is the effectiveness of these chemicals that decides whether a person develops complications from the coronavirus or makes a full recovery.\nIf we take medicines that dampen this immune response, such as ibuprofen, this can lead to us not fighting off the infection as effectively, potentially leading to a longer illness with a higher risk of complications.\nThese warnings to avoid ibuprofen (commonly known by the brand name Advil) generated mixed reactions among the medical community, with some asserting that scientific evidence to support it was lacking, and others maintaining that it was generally good advice:\n\u201cDeeply concerned about this bold statement,\u201d Muge Cevik, a researcher at the University of St Andrews Infection and Global Health Division, said on Twitter. \u201cThere\u2019s no scientific evidence I am aware of that ibuprofen [causes worse] outcomes in #COVID19.\u201d\nBut other experts suggested that V\u00e9ran\u2019s advice is in line with some countries\u2019 general guidance on anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen, even if their specific connection to the coronavirus is not clear.\n\u201cThere is a good reason to avoid ibuprofen as it may exacerbate acute kidney injury brought on by any severe illness, including severe COVID-19 disease. There isn\u2019t yet any widely accepted additional reason to avoid it for COVID-19,\u201d Rupert Beale, a group leader in Cell Biology of Infection at the UK\u2019s Francis Crick Institute, told the UK\u2019s Science Media Centre.\nExemplifying that split of opinion, Dr. Tom Wingfield, senior clinical lecturer and honorary consultant physician at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, observed that it was unclear whether the proffered advice about ibuprofen was specific to COVID-19 or merely ordinary \u201cgood practice,\u201d but that in any case paracetamol (acetaminophen) \u201cwould generally be preferred over ibuprofen to relieve symptoms caused by infection such as fever\u201d:\nIn the UK, paracetamol would generally be preferred over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (\u201cNSAIDS\u201d) such as ibuprofen to relieve symptoms caused by infection such as fever. This is because, when taken according to the manufacturer\u2019s and/or a health professional\u2019s instructions in terms of timing and maximum dosage, it is less likely to cause side effects. Side effects associated with NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, especially if taken regularly for a prolonged period, are stomach irritation and stress on the kidneys, which can be more severe in people who already have stomach or kidney issues. It is not clear from the French Minister\u2019s comments whether the advice given is generic \u2018good practice\u2019 guidance or specifically related to data emerging from cases of Covid-19 but this might become clear in due course. It should also be noted that, in the UK, we would not commonly use cortisone to relieve infection-related symptoms such as fever.\nAs Khan cautioned, for now patients and their doctors will need to be aware of the \u201ccareful balance between managing the symptoms of their long-term health condition and risking the devastating effects of the coronavirus.\u201d He advised that paracetamol or acetaminophen may be preferable alternative medications for pain and fever associated with COVID-19. Evaluate the following assertion: Patients should avoid taking ibuprofen to relieve pain and fever associated with COVID-19 infections. If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: As a COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic spread throughout the world in early 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) urged countries to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d for the virus in order to stop it from spreading. WHO officials said the global health organization had provided 1.5 million tests to 120 countries.\n\u201cYou cannot fight a fire blindfolded,\u201d said WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus during a March 16 press conference. \u201cAnd we cannot stop this pandemic if we don\u2019t know who is infected.\u201d\nThe global health leader\u2019s comments came as state and local governments across the United States began instituting \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures that included shuttering bars and restaurants and instructing residents to stay home and avoid large social gatherings. Despite these aggressive actions,\u00a0the U.S. as a whole was lagging behind other countries and struggling to ramp up diagnostic testing for the disease despite intense pressure to do so and confirmed cases that mounted into the thousands.\nThe first case of COVID-19 was reported in the U.S. in Washington state in late January 2020. Around that same time, officials in China quarantined Wuhan, the city where the disease was initially detected. By the end of January, the WHO deemed the new virus a global health emergency.\nNevertheless, the U.S. was still in the early stages of rolling out testing for the disease weeks after its first case was reported, resulting in something of a scandal, as cases that could be confirmed multiplied.\nAccording to news reports, diagnostic tests developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were sent out by early February 2020 to public health labs in the U.S. Days later, however, labs were reporting back that the tests weren\u2019t working due to a manufacturing defect. The defective tests, coupled with regulatory red tape that prevented state laboratories from using their own tests, caused further delay.\nThis resulted in a bevy of accusations that the U.S. \u201cshunned\u201d or \u201crefused\u201d working tests available from WHO even as its own testing protocols fell short. As the BBC reported, \u201cThe US declined to use a test approved by the World Health Organization in January \u2014 instead, the CDC developed its own coronavirus test. However, there were manufacturing defects with the initial CDC tests which meant many of the results were inconclusive.\u201d\nThe accusation was even echoed on the presidential election debate stage, with 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden saying: \u201cLook, the World Health Organization offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own.\u201d\nWe sent emails to the CDC and WHO asking about WHO\u2019s test and why it was not adopted in the U.S., but did not get a reply in time for publication. However, WHO told PolitiFact that the organization had never discussed providing testing kits to the United States, and The Washington Post reported that it\u2019s typical, historically, for the U.S. to develop its own methods under such circumstances:\nChina developed its own test. Leading laboratories in Germany published their own version, which was adopted by the World Health Organization. Many countries, including the United States, developed their own tests.\nThe traditional U.S. strategy for devising new diagnostic tests starts with the CDC. That is supposed to ensure new tests are accurate and reliable, but it also meant that other parallel approaches were not aggressively pursued.\nIn an interview with CNN on March 12, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stated that it would have been \u201cnice to have\u201d the WHO tests as a back-up to the CDC\u2019s tests, but characterized it as a case of hindsight being 20/20.\n[DR. SANJAY] GUPTA: And, Dr. Fauci, I want to echo what Anderson said as well. Thank you very much for your service. People may not know this, Dr. Fauci is 79 years old and, I mean, you have the energy I think many of us emulate. Let me ask one more question though about this testing. I know you\u2019ve talked a lot about it, but I think, you know, Dr. Fauci, there was a test.\nIt was being distributed around the world. WHO was using this test, I believe it was created in Germany, in Berlin, and it was being used, and yet we did not use it in this country even as a stopgap measure, even as we prepared to make our own test. And as a result, we got behind. That\u2019s a problem. And I\u2019m just wondering, was that a mistake? Should we have used that test? Why didn\u2019t we?\nFAUCI: Well, you know, Sanjay, I\u2019m not sure that it was a mistake. But certainly, you know, if you look back and Monday morning quarterback, it would have been nice to have had a backup. But what the CDC has done over many, many years when we have things like this is to develop their own test, which is always really a good test, and to roll it out in a way that we call a public health-directed, where they give it to departments of public health.\nYou have a physician-patient relationship. They come in. They order the test. They get the test. It was not designed for the kind of mass distribution that we need now that we\u2019ve seen in other countries. That\u2019s behind us. Looking forward, we\u2019re going very much in that direction, Sanjay, very much so.\nAnd I think really within a relatively short period of time, you know, a week or maybe even less, we\u2019re going to start to see the ratcheting up of the availability of test. So, you know, rather than go back and play Monday morning quarterback, let\u2019s just direct where we\u2019re going.\nAlthough Trump\u2019s political opponents and some media sources accused his administration of \u201crefusing\u201d to use the WHO test, Fauci\u2019s comment and various credible news reports on the topic indicate that the CDC has a standard procedure for handling diagnostic tests during an outbreak, and that protocol doesn\u2019t include using tests provided by WHO (or any other external organization). We therefore rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: The United States \"refused\" COVID-19 diagnostic tests offered by the World Health Organization.

You have to blame something else. If you do something bad, never, ever blame yourself.\u201d\nWe have been unable to verify the authenticity of this quote, nor have we been able to confirm that this image shows a genuine copy of The Sun from Sept. 12, 2005.

This 2004 story, however, is very light on details and provides no information about where, when, or in what context Trump made the comment.\nThe fact that this quote has been online since at least 2004 lends some credence to the idea that it is a genuine comment from Trump.

Here\u2019s an example of a query, posted to Twitter, with the user\u2019s name cropped out for privacy.\n\nThe letter, dated April 2, 2020, is indeed real and was posted to WhiteHouse.gov. Signed by Trump, the letter is an expression of the acrimony between Trump and legislators from New York, a state that has been ravaged by the deadly COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. Trump and the Democratic leadership of that state had been trading accusations, with political leaders of the Empire State accusing the Trump administration of failing to mount an adequate federal response and provide desperately needed medical equipment as the death toll rises.\nTrump\u2019s letter to Schumer appeared to blame the shortage of supplies, like diagnostic tests, protective gear for medical workers, and ventilators, on impeachment proceedings against Trump. He was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives in December 2019 and acquitted by the Senate in early February 2020. The letter reads, in part:\nIf you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax, which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere (except increasing my poll numbers), and instead focused on helping the people of New York, then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the \u201cinvisible enemy.\u201d No wonder AOC [U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] and others are thinking about running against you in the primary. If they did, they would likely win.\nTrump\u2019s letter was in response to a letter that Schumer sent him the same day. Schumer\u2019s letter urged Trump to use the full authority of the so-called Defense Protection Act to close the gap in equipment shortfalls as the virus swept across the country and to prevent states from being forced to bid against each other in order to acquire medical supplies and protective equipment. The letter also implored Trump to designate a senior military official to oversee production of supplies and accused the Trump administration of \u201ctardiness and inadequacy\u201d in its response.\nAs of this writing, the state of New York has more than 100,000 COVID-19 cases, with 2,935 deaths.

According to The Associated Press, online data published by China\u2019s three largest cellphone carriers indicated that for January and February 2020, China Mobile Ltd. reported a drop of nearly 7.25 million subscribers, while China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. lost 7.8 million subscribers and China Telecom Corp. lost 5.6 million in February alone.\nAs of April 2020, China had reported a total of about 81,000 COVID-19 cases and about 3,300 deaths from the disease. Some sources seized on the disparity between the numbers of afflicted and cellphone subscribers to assert that the true COVID-19 death in China had been concealed and vastly underreported.\n\u201c21 Million Fewer Cellphone Users in China May Suggest a High CCP Virus Death Toll,\u201d proclaimed a headline in The Epoch Times. \u201cChina Is Lying About the Number of COVID-19 Deaths,\u201d declared the Panam Post:\n\nIt is true that intelligence officials outside of China believe that the country\u2019s government has understated the spread of the coronavirus and the damage the pandemic has caused there, as The New York Times, among others, reported in early April 2020:\nThe C.I.A. has been warning the White House since at least early February that China has vastly understated its coronavirus infections and that its count could not be relied upon as the United States compiles predictive models to fight the virus, according to current and former intelligence officials.\nAmerican intelligence agencies have concluded that the Chinese government itself does not know the extent of the virus and is as blind as the rest of the world. Midlevel bureaucrats in the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated, and elsewhere in China have been lying about infection rates, testing and death counts, fearful that if they report numbers that are too high they will be punished, lose their position or worse, current and former intelligence officials said.\nBureaucratic misreporting is a chronic problem for any government, but it has grown worse in China as the Communist leadership has taken a more authoritarian turn in recent years under Mr. Xi.\nThe Times reported again the following day that Chinese officials appeared to be pushing for quick burials of the dead and suppressing online discussion of fatalities in order to head off public opprobrium over the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak:\nFor months, the residents of Wuhan had been told they could not pick up the ashes of their loved ones who had died during the height of China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Now that the authorities say the epidemic is under control, officials are pushing the relatives to bury the dead quickly and quietly, and they are suppressing online discussion of fatalities as doubts emerge about the true size of the toll.\nChina\u2019s official death toll from the coronavirus stood at 3,322 on [April 3], but medical workers and others have suggested the count should be higher \u2026\nAs China tries to control the narrative, the police in Wuhan, where the pandemic began, have been dispatched to break up groups on WeChat, a popular messaging app, set up by the relatives of coronavirus victims. Government censors have scrubbed images circulating on social media showing relatives in the city lining up at funeral homes to collect ashes. Officials have assigned minders to relatives to follow them as they pick burial plots, claim their loved ones\u2019 remains and bury them, grieving family members say.\nThe ruling Communist Party says it is trying to prevent large gatherings from causing a new outbreak. But its tight controls appear to be part of a concerted attempt to avoid an outpouring of anguish and anger that could be a visceral reminder of its early missteps and efforts to conceal the outbreak. Those same public displays or discussions of loss could also feed skepticism over how China has counted the dead.\nStill, to believe that the drop in cellphone subscriptions experienced by Chinese carriers corresponds directly to unreported coronavirus deaths, one would have to believe that the Chinese government managed to misreport COVID-19 mortality in that country by a factor of about 7,000 \u2026 and then let the cat out of the bag by openly publishing statistics about cellphone usage that revealed those unreported deaths. Perhaps some correlation exists, but as The Associated Press reported, the drop in cellphone subscriptions in China could also be attributable to reasons other than millions of subscribers\u2019 succumbing to COVID-19:\nA representative with China Mobile Ltd. said while the situation was related to the COVID-19 outbreak, it was not related to deaths, but changes in lifestyle.\n\u201cIt was mainly due to reduced business and social activities resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak,\u201d a spokesperson with the company confirmed to the AP. \u201cMany customers in China have multiple SIM cards and it is common that they use their non-primary SIM cards to do these activities.\u201d\nA China Unicom representative acknowledged the difficult market forces at work: \u201cFor the first two months of 2020, [we were] facing challenges such as market saturation, keen market competition and the novel coronavirus outbreak \u2026\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: A drop of 21 million cellphone subscribers in China in early 2020 documents that the death toll from COVID-19 was vastly underreported in that country.

Made from T-shirts or bandanas, these face coverings are an at-home alternative to surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which the CDC recommended only for healthcare workers on the front lines of the pandemic.\nThe recommendation \u2014 which the CDC posted in a statement on its website alongside a 45-second video of U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams demonstrating how to make one of the cloth masks \u2014 spurred a wave of do-it-yourself guides online.\u00a0\nBut this raised a new dilemma among crafty Americans making their own masks: How should people clean the masks in order to safely reuse them? Making a new face guard for each trip outside could prove tedious.\nCue the advice of Facebook: \u201cThose that use a fabric mask \u2013 after wearing place in ziplock bag and microwave 2-3 minutes to sanitize. Do this after each wear,\u201d says a post that users have shared more than 7,200 times. Another post with similar advice has about five times that amount of shares.\nPeople contacted Snopes seeking clarity.\nAccording to an April 9 instructional guide by the CDC, people who go outside wearing fabric or cloth masks should clean them regularly, the frequency of which depends on how often the face coverings are used. When asked by Snopes if microwaving cloth masks will sanitize them, a CDC spokesperson responded via email with a bulleted list of what cloth face coverings should do, including \u201cfit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face\u201d and \u201cbe able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape.\u201d The latter bullet point was highlighted yellow in the email.\nIn other words, the CDC has not explicitly forbidden the public from microwaving the face coverings nor weighed in on the effectiveness of the method. But it has made this recommendation, including in its April 9 guide: \u201cA washing machine should suffice in properly washing a face covering.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Greeneville/Greene County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security on Facebook warned against microwaving face masks, writing on Facebook:\nThere are a couple of problems with this:\n1. The microwave will set flame and/or burn certain materials.\n2. If your mask has metal in it, refer to issue number 1, as well as, possibly killing your microwave.\nPlease do NOT microwave your hand made masks.\nWashing in warm water and Antibacterial Soap and a small amount of bleach will disinfect your masks of any germs. Yes this includes COVID-19.\n\u201cDO NOT place any face mask in the microwave for any amount of time,\u201d the Colorado River Fire Rescue department also said on Facebook. \u201cThere is no evidence that microwaving a face mask will sanitize it properly.\u201d\nProof of people\u2019s failed attempts at the microwave idea are available via social media, too. People have shared stories of kitchen fires starting in their microwave and photos of charred fabric masks. \u201cI tried it,\u201d one Facebook user wrote. \u201cPlease don\u2019t try it. It smells awful.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: Microwaving fabric masks is a good way to sanitize them for reuse.

Along with the posts were articles claiming he died from complications of the coronavirus disease.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a screenshot supposedly showing a post from McDaniel on March 15 and a snippet from his obituary a month later:\n\nMcDaniel truly died from complications related to COVID-19 in April 2020 after he downplayed the seriousness of the disease on social media.\u00a0\nThe New York Daily News wrote:\u00a0\nAn Ohio man has tragically died from COVID-19 after criticizing his state\u2019s coronavirus lockdown.\nJohn W. McDaniel, 60, died Wednesday in Columbus, exactly one month after reportedly calling Gov. Mike DeWine\u2019s stay-at-home order \u201cmadness.\u201d\n\u201cIf what I\u2019m hearing is true, that DeWine has ordered all bars and restaurants to be closed, I say bullshit! He doesn\u2019t have the authority,\u201d McDaniel reportedly wrote in a since-deleted social media post circulated widely on social media.\nAs screenshots of McDaniel\u2019s posts went viral, many social media users took the opportunity to criticize McDaniel, saying he had received his comeuppance for calling the virus a political ploy.\u00a0\nMcDaniel\u2019s wife, Lisa, acknowledged that her husband had made some \u201cearly assumptions\u201d about the virus on social media, but added that social media users were also making unfair assumptions about him.\u00a0\nIn a statement posted to the Snyder Funeral Homes Facebook page that announced services for McDaniel would not be live-streamed due to concerns about unwanted, negative social media reactions, she explained that McDaniel, like many others, was initially not fully aware of the severity of the pandemic. However, she wrote that he ordered the employees at his company O&M to work from home on March 16 (the day after the above-displayed Facebook post). Furthermore, according to her Facebook message, he self-isolated as soon as he was made aware that he had been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.\nLastly, she wrote that if he were still alive, he would have abided by the state\u2019s stay-at-home order and would have encouraged others to do the same.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s her statement from April 22, 2020 (emphasis ours):\nWords do not describe all of the emotions we, John W. McDaniel\u2019s family, are experiencing right now. We are overwhelmed with grief for the loss of our believed husband, father, soon to be father-in-law, son, brother, uncle, and dear friend to many. Similar to thousands of people, we are suffering from an unexpected and untimely loss due to the effects of COVID-19, the likes of which we never could have imagined. During this time of mourning, John\u2019s story, along with early assumptions that he stated on Twitter and Facebook have turned into national news. The news has opened the flood gates for people to share their own misguided anger and unfounded assumptions about a man they don\u2019t know. Wanting to protect my family and John\u2019s legacy, we have decided not to live stream his funeral services via Facebook today. We will be privately recording his services today and we will be sharing it directly with his family and friends. We have not come to this decision lightly and we hope everyone will honor and respect this decision. \u00a0\nAs each day passes, we all are learning more about this \u201cinvisible enemy.\u201d We have all learned that the early actions taken by our National and State government were indeed the right action to take. Quarantine and social distancing have been effective in flattening the curve. John, President of O&M, ordered the company to work from home on March 16. In addition, it is important to note that John immediately self-isolated as soon as he learned he had been in contact with someone who had tested positive. Many, like John, made statements early on not fully aware of the severity of COVID-19; many have retracted their statements knowing now the effects of this pandemic. We know if John was still here with us he would acknowledge the national crisis we\u2019re are in, abide by the stay-at-home order, and encourage family and friends to do the same. But sadly he is not with us and we will forever have to live and cope with how his life ended far too soon. Further, we will never be able to erase from our hears and minds the negative posts that have been made and shared about John this past week.\nTo all of our family and friends, my sons and I will never be able to appropriately say \u201cthank you\u201d for all the love and support you have given us throughout this entire process. From the bottom of our hearts we will forever be grateful for you and the special relationship we share.\nWhile some may cast aspersions on McDaniel for not treating COVID-19 with the seriousness it deserved in March 2020, it should be noted that misinformation has been rampant during this pandemic.\nWe\u2019ve debunked scores of rumors over several months that have touted bad medical advice and promoted conspiracy theories. U.S. President Donald Trump, too, has been criticized for downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 and has repeatedly called the news outlets outlets covering this pandemic \u201cfake news.\u201d On Feb. 28, just two weeks before McDaniel posted on social media that COVID-19 was a \u201cpolitical ploy,\u201d Trump said during a rally that \u201cDemocrats are politicizing the coronavirus\u201d as their \u201cnew hoax.\u201d\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: An Ohio man died from complications related to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease weeks after he downplayed the virus on social media.

At that time, social media users shared a photograph of a flyer for an \u201cEnd the Lockdown\u201d rally that seemed aimed at achieving the worst possible outcome in encouraging that participants need not wear masks, should bring their children along, and attend even if they were already sick:\n\nThe cropping of the image seen above cut off the top portion of the poster, which identified it as referring to a \u201cLiberate Staten Island\u201d rally. We don\u2019t know at this time whether the flyer was on the level or whether it was intended as a spoof of the reckless attitudes of some protesters, but we can verify that at least a few such flyers were posted around Tottenville, a neighborhood on the South Shore of Staten Island, as reported by the Staten Island Advance:\nFliers promoting an \u201cEnd the Lockdown Rally\u201d were spotted at the CVS on Page Avenue, and on the corner of Main Street and Amboy Road.\nThe promotional material said the rally would take place Sunday morning at 11 a.m. on the Conference House lawn in Tottenville.\n\u201cNo mask needed.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a fake news detection task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: As the U.S. federal government and states clashed over how to respond to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020, workers on the frontlines of helping virus patients reported widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 masks and gowns. Hospital and state leaders described a chaotic and highly competitive market for securing supplies from vendors \u2014 disarray that critics of President Donald Trump blamed on his ad-hoc approach to addressing the shortfall.\nMeanwhile, several news reports surfaced, claiming federal officials seized PPE shipments from local agencies or stopped the deals between vendors and states by offering higher bids. Snopes received numerous inquiries from readers about the validity of the assertion.\u00a0\n\nTo get to the root of the claim, we first researched from where the news reports originated. From The New York Times to the Boston Globe to The Intelligencer (a blog within New York magazine), several media outlets highlighted the experience of Dr. Andrew W. Artenstein, an infectious disease physician in Springfield, Massachusetts, who said the pandemic has forced him into PPE supply-chain work. On April 17, 2020, he published a letter in a peer-reviewed medical journal, The New England Journal of Medicine, about his apparent travails of getting a large shipment of face masks and respirators from a warehouse in a mid-Atlantic state. (He told The New York Times he would not publicize the location of the transaction out of fear of jeopardizing his relationship with the supply vendor.) The letter read:\nBefore we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me. No, this shipment was not headed for resale or the black market. The agents checked my credentials, and I tried to convince them that the shipment of PPE was bound for hospitals. After receiving my assurances and hearing about our health system\u2019s urgent needs, the agents let the boxes of equipment be released and loaded into the trucks. But I was soon shocked to learn that the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting our PPE. Only some quick calls leading to intervention by our congressional representative prevented its seizure.\u00a0\nIt is unclear why federal officials may have targeted the Massachusetts delivery or where they would have allegedly redirected the supplies. Citing a policy of not confirming or denying specific investigations, the FBI declined to comment on Artenstein\u2019s account in an April 20 New York Times story, saying only that the agency had been working to ensure that PPE \u201cis not being unlawfully distributed or hoarded\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, the Boston Globe could not reach the Department of Homeland Security, which encompasses FEMA, to comment on the doctor\u2019s story.\nThough widely circulated online, Artenstein\u2019s story was not the only report of federal interference in the procurement of PPE in spring 2020. On April 7, the Los Angeles Times reported health care officials in seven states said the federal government seized their shipments and did not give guidance on how or if the local agencies would someday get the supplies they ordered. \u201cAre they stockpiling this stuff? Are they distributing it? We don\u2019t know,\u201d one unidentified official told the LA Times. \u201cAnd are we going to ever get any of it back if we need supplies? It would be nice to know these things.\u201d\nAdditionally, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told The New York Times that FEMA stepped in at the last minute of a deal the city had with \u201cone of its usual suppliers\u201d to buy 1 million masks; a New Jersey county official told local media an order of 35,000 N95 and other masks were \u201ccommandeered\u201d by the federal government; and a leader of the private health care company Kaiser Permanente told staff members that the company had found 20 million masks to purchase, \u201cbut the feds actually seized that shipment before we were able to acquire it,\u201d the Times reported. The same news story said:\nIn Massachusetts, state leaders said they had confirmed a vast order of personal protective equipment for their health workers; then the Trump administration took control of the shipments.\nIn Kentucky, the head of a hospital system told members of Congress that his broker had pulled out of an agreement to deliver four shipments of desperately needed medical gear after the supplies were commandeered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nGov. Jared Polis of Colorado thought his state had secured 500 ventilators before they were \u201cswept up by FEMA.\u201d\nAdding to those reports are worries by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker that if he publicly discusses how he\u2019s obtaining masks and gloves for his state, federal officials may catch wind and seize the materials, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cThe supply chain has been likened to the wild West, and once you have purchased supplies, ensuring they get to the state is another herculean feat,\u201d a spokesperson for the governor told the news outlet.\u00a0\nThe reports began surfacing around the time the Trump administration launched a new public-private partnership to quickly distribute mass shipments of protective gear to the U.S. from factories overseas. The so-called Project Airbridge initiative (championed by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser) came after repeated requests from the president for states to handle the supply issue themselves, allegations from some local leaders that the federal government was distributing the equipment unfairly, and Trump choosing FEMA to replace the Department of Health and Human Services as the leading agency to respond to the crisis, a move that changed how states submit formal requests for supplies from the national stockpile.\nExplaining the spring 2020 initiative, FEMA said in a statement that the agency redirects roughly half of each international shipment to U.S. locations it has deemed in highest need, using COVID-19 data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Simultaneously, the agency said it is sending the remainder of orders to businesses, health care facilities and counties that have placed orders in the past.\nYet despite the claims from state and hospital leaders, the federal government has not explicitly said it is confiscating or blocking PPE orders at the local level \u2014 nor explained why it would. It also has not outlined a long-range plan for the alleged intervention efforts, or how the supplies would be divvied up. FEMA officials\u2019 response to the allegations include, in chronological order:\nGiven the amount of reports from state officials and health care leaders claiming that federal officials seized or blocked PPE orders, and those accounts\u2019 level of specificity and apparent validity, we rate this claim \u201cMostly True\u201d \u2014 with the caveat that the intervention efforts appear to be a part of a broader distribution plan that purportedly aims to get supplies to regions with the most urgent needs.

Bryan, the acting undersecretary for science and technology at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, about how heat and humidity could impact the spread of COVID-19 during the summer months. Bryan mentioned a recent, non-peer-reviewed study that showed how disinfectants and sunlight could kill the coronavirus on non-porous surfaces such as counters or door handles.\u00a0\nBryan\u2019s presentation focused on how light and disinfectants affected the coronavirus on surfaces. But when Trump took the podium, he started talking about what would happen if light and disinfectants were \u201cbrought inside the body\u201d to fight the virus.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the official White House transcript of Trump\u2019s remarks (emphasis added):\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. So I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of, if you\u2019re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous \u2014 whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just very powerful light \u2014 and I think you said that that hasn\u2019t been checked, but you\u2019re going to test it. And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you\u2019re going to test that too. It sounds interesting.\nACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: We\u2019ll get to the right folks who could.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Right. And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds \u2014 it sounds interesting to me.\nSo we\u2019ll see. But the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s pretty powerful.\nTrump made this comment following a presentation on how sunlight and disinfectant affect the coronavirus. This presentation prompted Trump to discuss a question he said \u201cprobably some of you are thinking of\u201d concerning what would happen if you \u201cbrought the light inside the body.\u201d As Trump continued, he also offered his thoughts on how disinfectants could be brought inside the body \u201cby injection.\u201d While Trump noted that this method would have to be checked by doctors, he said it sounded interesting to him.\u00a0\nThe remarks spurred widespread condemnation from health officials, who issued statements urging people not to inject or ingest cleaning products.\u00a0\nDr. Vin Gupta, a pulmonologist and global health policy expert and NBC News contributor, said:\n\u201cThis notion of injecting or ingesting any type of cleansing product into the body is irresponsible, and it\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s a common method that people utilize when they want to kill themselves.\u201d\nReckitt Benckiser, the British company that manufacturers Lysol and Dettol, published a statement on its website saying that \u201cunder no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body\u201d:\nDue to recent speculation and social media activity, RB (the makers of Lysol and Dettol) has been asked whether internal administration of disinfectants may be appropriate for investigation or use as a treatment for coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).\nAs a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route). As with all products, our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines. Please read the label and safety information.\nWhile medical experts and cleaning-supply companies feared Trump\u2019s suggestion that disinfectants could be injected as a treatment for COVID-19 could result in people poisoning themselves by ingesting or injecting cleaning products, some of the president\u2019s supporters claimed his remarks were taken out of context.\u00a0\nWhite House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany noted that Trump also told Americans to consult with their doctors regarding coronavirus treatments. \u201cLeave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines,\u201d she said. Other Trump defenders noted that Trump clarified later in the briefing that disinfectants would not, in fact, be administered \u201cthrough injections,\u201d but the \u201cclarification\u201d itself was less than clear.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be through injection,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn\u2019t work. But it certainly has a big effect if it\u2019s on a stationary object.\u201d\nIn any case, attempts to deflect criticism of Trump\u2019s remarks were rendered moot the next day, when the president essentially admitted discussing the injection of disinfectants to treat COVID-19 by claiming he said it \u201csarcastically\u201d to prank reporters:\n\u201cI was asking a question sarcastically to reporters just like you, just to see what would happen. I was asking a sarcastic and a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside. But it does kill it and it would kill it on the hands, and it would make things much better.\u201d\nWhether or not his tone was sarcastic is something of a subjective call.

While dozens of medical experts have already debunked this idea (the evidence indicates that the virus evolved naturally), this bit of misinformation continued to spread on social media.\u00a0\nIn April 2020, for instance, a lengthy text message started to circulate on Facebook and WhatsApp that supposedly included a quote from Nobel laureate Dr. Tasuku Honjo in which he ostensibly said that COVID-19 was \u201cinvented\u201d at a lab in Wuhan, China:\n\nThe text of the post reads:\u00a0\nIt\u2019s as damning an indictment as it could be stretched to. China is accused of inventing the Coronavirus in its Wuhan laboratory with whatever intent that might have prompted the venture.\nA Nobel laureate Japanese academician, Dr. Tasuku Honjo (pictured below), who had shared a 2018 Nobel prize for his outstanding works in the study of immunology, had revealed the reasons for blaming China for inventing the deadly virus that had already infected, maimed and killed millions across the globe.\nProfessor Honjo maintains, \u201cI know the Chinese labs where the virus was perfected. I called many times since the Wuhan breakout. Phones are dead. Doctors and technicians involved were killed.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cnatural viruses are temperature and climate-sensitive. Corona had affected every nation, irrespective of geography, climate and temperature. Had it been natural, it\u2019s spreading would have been limited to Wuhan like places and climate.\u201d\nDr. Honjo threw a challenge in support of his finding and the assertions, saying, \u201cif it\u2019s not proven even after my death, take away my Nobel prize.\u201d\nHonjo never worked at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the quotes in this post are fictitious, and China did not \u201cinvent\u201d this virus. But in this message\u2019s defense, it does accurately state that Honjo won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2018.\nHonjo is currently the Deputy Director-General and Distinguished Professor at the Kyoto University Institute for Advanced Study. A biography on the KUIAS website lists the various institutes and academies Honjo has been associated with since the 1960s. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is not included.\u00a0\nWe searched for the quotes included in this viral text but could not find them reported by any credible sources. In fact, it appears that this quotation exists solely in social media posts. We did find a Twitter account using the handle @TasukuHonjo that expressed similar sentiments as the above-displayed quotes, but it doesn\u2019t appear that this account actually belongs to the Nobel Prize winner.\u00a0\n\nFor starters, this account is not verified. It is also only a few days old (its first tweet was posted on April 23) and it has been used almost exclusively to push conspiratorial content regarding COVID-19.\u00a0\nThe Indian fact-checking website News Meter managed to contact one of Honjo\u2019s students who issued a statement on the Nobel Prize winner\u2019s behalf. The statement confirmed that this Twitter account was fake, that Honjo never worked at the Wuhan lab, and that these were not real quotes:\u00a0\nProf. Honjo never gave any such statement. Each and every sentence of this post is completely false and has no connection with truth. Prof. Honjo never worked in Wuhan laboratory. He never called there. He did not work on virus origin and functions and other related issues. All the contents are just concocted and nothing else\u2026\n\u2026 The twitter handle you mentioned does not belong to Prof. Tasuku Honjo. it is created by someone possibly with malicious intentions. Please stop this fake news.\nFurthermore, Honjo\u2019s genuine public statements about the pandemic fly in the face of the quotes presented in this viral piece of text.\nFor instance, in an interview with the Nikkei Asian Review, Honjo was asked why medical advancements have not been able to eradicate infectious diseases. While the fake quote included in the above-displayed text falsely claimed Honjo said that \u201cnatural viruses\u201d couldn\u2019t spread around the globe due to factors such as climate, Honjo\u2019s genuine response to this question shows that he actually has the opposite view, saying that \u201cone novel virus can turn the world on its head\u201d and that \u201cinfectious disease can spread quickly to a large number of patients.\u201d\nHonjo said:\nMedicine has evolved dramatically even compared with 20 years ago, but every new virus requires a new response. Physics and chemistry have established principles, but biology is a science that\u2019s still developing, and there\u2019s so much we still don\u2019t know. So one novel virus can turn the world on its head. Many people probably wonder why, but that\u2019s just the reality.\nInfectious diseases are completely different from something like cancer. Infectious diseases can spread quickly to a large number of patients. Meanwhile, incidence and survival rates for cancer largely stay constant, and expertise in the area is growing steadily.\nResearch into infectious diseases needs to go hand in hand with immunology. There\u2019s no point in looking only at the virus, and we need to know how people battling the virus respond to it.\nOn April 27, 2020, Honjo published a statement saying that he was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d that his name, and the name of Kyoto University, have been used to spread misinformation.\nHonjo wrote:\nIn the wake of the pain, economic loss, and unprecedented global suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am greatly saddened that my name and that of Kyoto University have been used to spread false accusations and misinformation.\nThis is a time for all of us, especially those of us devoting our careers to the forefronts of scientific research, to work together to fight this common enemy. We cannot delay one moment in this effort to save the lives of our fellow humans. At this stage, when all of our energies are needed to treat the ill, prevent the further spread of sorrow, and plan for a new beginning, the broadcasting of unsubstantiated claims regarding the origins of the disease is dangerously distracting.\nThis University devotes itself to furthering the wellbeing of humanity based on a principal of harmonious coexistence with the natural environment. It is my enduring pleasure and honor to support this aim to my fullest. Let us keep our eyes on the highest goals attainable by our species.\nHonjo did not work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, he did not say that COVID-19 was \u201cinvented\u201d or \u201cman-made,\u201d and the Twitter account posting similar claims does not belong to the Nobel Prize winner. In addition, this rumor is all based on the unfounded notion that COVID-19 was created as a bioweapon. You can read our examination of that false conspiracy theory here. Evaluate the following assertion: Nobel laureate Dr. Tasuku Honjo said that COVID-19 was \"man-made\" at a lab in Wuhan, China. If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a fake news detection task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In April 2020, during an unprecedented interruption to the U.S. economy due to social-distancing restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, the United States Postal Service (USPS) remained in operation. Canvassing city streets and rural roads with packages of prescriptions, food, and bills, the mail carriers provided a lifeline for many Americans who feared leaving their homes during the pandemic.\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the federally run Postal Service must serve all Americans equally regardless of where they live. But with a novel virus plaguing the country \u2014 spreading from person to person \u2014 that commitment to service came at a cost: 1,800 USPS employees had either tested positive for or were suspected to have caught COVID-19 as of April 25, according to the National Association of Letter Carriers. And more than 40 such workers had died.\nThe virus\u2019 toll on employees\u2019 health was not the only pandemic-fueled problem for leaders of the Postal Service; a decline in mail deliveries \u2014 a leading source of revenue for the agency \u2014 due to business shutdowns raised worries that the national mail carrier would not economically recover from a coronavirus recession. From high-profile Democrats in Washington, D.C., to less-known musicians who said they rely on USPS to help them run independent labels, supporters across the country took to Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit to call attention to what they feared were limited days left for USPS.\n\nMany of the social media posts included calls to action. Supporters rushed to buy stamps, hoping any type of profit boost would stave off a collapse, or urged people to contact U.S. lawmakers and tell them to help the Postal Service with federal funds. As of April 28, almost 390,000 people had signed an online petition on Change.org to express their support for USPS, while more than 440,000 people had endorsed an open letter using an automated texting service (texted \u201cUSPS\u201d to 50409) that promised to contact congressional representatives on behalf of petitioners. The letter states:\nIn the age of COVID-19, having a healthy and strong postal service is more important than ever. More and more Americans are relying on the USPS to deliver medicines, food, and essentials now that social distancing is a matter of life and death.\nSeeing those pleas online, numerous people contacted Snopes to investigate the validity of the claim that the national mail carrier was, indeed, on the brink of closure due to the pandemic. \nThe claim is multi-faceted, asserting that USPS could shutter soon, and that the coronavirus pandemic would be the reason why. To get to the root of each assertion, we began by analyzing the history of funding for USPS \u2014 which is an independent executive agency and has not received taxpayer funding in decades \u2014 and changes in how Americans rely on it.\nAs online communication advanced between 2010 and 2020, USPS\u2019 volume of first-class and marketing mail decreased \u2014 a problem for the agency\u2019s bottom line because stamps and other postal products to send that type of mail make lucrative profit margins. Meanwhile, private competitors such as Amazon and FedEx grew in popularity and reach, raising USPS\u2019 package volume because the agency contracts with them (often for what\u2019s called the \u201clast mile\u201d of deliveries in rural or remote areas). Such shipments for the USPS increased from 3.1 billion in 2010 to 6.2 billion in 2018, federal data show.\nBut market trends aside, the agency for years has run in the red, with a total of $143 billion in unfunded liabilities and debt as of fall 2018 (an amount that is double its annual revenue), according to the U.S Government Accountability Office. The debt, in large part, is a result of a congressional mandate on how the agency must fund retiree pensions and health benefits for employees. In 2006, under the George W. Bush\u2019 presidential administration and a Republican-led Congress, the federal government enacted the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which forced USPS to add up what it expected to spend on the benefits over the next 50 years and then prepay that amount between 2007 and 2016. The math rounded out to an expense of about $5.6 billion annually. But in 2012, the agency began defaulting on the payments.\nThat history aside, the pandemic is only hurting the agency\u2019s already-troubled financial situation.\u00a0Addressing a group of congressional lawmakers in earlyApril 9, Postmaster General Megan Brennan said mail volume had dropped 30 percent in the early days of the crisis, and that she expected that decline to reach 50 percent by the end of June. For this fiscal year, which runs from October 2019 to September 2020, she said the Postal Service was preparing for a $13 billion revenue shortfall due \u201cdirectly to COVID-19\u201d in 2020 and an additional $54.3 billion in losses over 10 years.\nConsidering those projections, she said\u00a0the agency could \u201crun out of cash this fiscal year\u201d (or the end of September) without federal intervention. \u201cThe sudden drop in mail volumes, our most profitable revenue stream, is steep and may never fully recover,\u201d she later told The New York Times.\nFurther details on the potential downturn were unknown; it was not explained where, or to what extent, regions may first notice interrupted USPS service due to the profit loss, nor if the agency would maintain its existing payroll of some 640,000 employees or close all together.\nUsing the COVID-19 outbreak in their rationale, some lawmakers \u2014 primarily U.S. House Democrats \u2014 attempted to rally support for and extend more federal money to help USPS in spring 2020. Among leaders of the public outcry was Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., who is a member of the House government operations committee that oversees the Postal Service. He told the Washington Post:\n\u201cI\u2019m so frustrated at how difficult it has been for a long time to galvanize attention and action around an essential service,\u2019 he said. \u2018And maybe the pandemic forces us all to refocus on this service and how essential it is and how we need to fix it while we can before it gets into critical condition.\u201d\nThe requests came to a head in March 2020 during negotiations over a $2.2 trillion COVID-19 economic relief package, called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Initially, lawmakers agreed to set aside $13 billion in federal dollars for USPS that the agency would not have to repay. But purportedly at the urging of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and aids to U.S. President Donald Trump, congressional leaders removed that provision from the CARES Act \u2014 while leaving its funding boosts to help small businesses, passenger airlines and air cargo carriers, and most U.S. taxpayers via one-time stimulus checks, among other provisions that aimed to jump-start the economy.\nAccording to a senior Trump administration official and a congressional official, Trump would have vetoed the entire bill if it had contained any such funding to help the postal agency, The Washington Post reported. \u201cWe told them very clearly that the president was not going to sign the bill if [money for the Postal Service] was in it,\u201d the Trump administration official said.\nIn last-round debates over what to include in the CARES Act, however, a bipartisan pair of senators (Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Ron Johnson, R-Wis.) proposed what some federal leaders considered a compromise between Trump and USPS advocates: a $10 billion loan to help the agency cover operating expenses through the spring of 2020. Trump signed the CARES Act into law on March 27, including the provision that read:\n\nBut, as of mid-April,\u00a0the Postal Service did not have access to the funds. Despite Trump\u2019s approval of the legislation, the USPS-specific provision required additional signatures from both him and Mnuchin before the agency could request the loan money. While signing off on other aspects of the federal stimulus bill on April 24, Trump said he will not sign the loan unless the service fulfills his long-standing request to raise prices on shipping and postal materials to cover its debt \u2014 a call to action based on a false assertion that the service loses money by delivering for Amazon. (Government analysts have said that type of price change could lead to private delivery competitors swooping in on USPS\u2019 business and, perhaps, offering cheaper prices for easy city routes and less options for rural Americans, and it would only raise a marginal amount of new revenue compared to USPS\u2019 total debt.) At the signing, Trump said:\nThe Postal Service is a joke because they\u2019re handing out packages for Amazon and other Internet companies. And every time they bring a package, they lose money on it \u2026 The post office should raise the price of a package by approximately four times. \u2026 If they don\u2019t raise the price, I\u2019m not signing anything.\nHours later, he followed up with a tweet:\n\nBut for House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the $10 billion loan is just the tip of the iceberg to get the Postal Service on solid financial footing and maintain existing functions beyond September 2020. \u201cThey don\u2019t need more debt capacity, they need debt forgiveness,\u201d said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York who chairs the House committee that oversees the U.S. Postal Service, to a news outlet for federal workers.\nIn a future stimulus package to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, several lawmakers in April proposed an $89 billion bailout for USPS \u2014 including $25 billion to offset lost revenue from declining shipments during the pandemic, $25 billion to modernize the agency\u2019s aging infrastructure, a $25 billion loan and a new system for paying $14 billion in debt. The Trump-appointed Postal Service Board of Governors, which includes three Republicans and two Democrats, unanimously approved of the request.\n\u2018The Postal Service is holding on for dear life,\u2019 Maloney said in a statement. \u201dUnless Congress and the White House provide meaningful relief in the next stimulus bill, the Postal Service could cease to exist.\u2019\nBut as of mid-April, the U.S. Treasury secretary suggested that if lawmakers fulfilled any such funding requests in the next COVID-19 stimulus package, the language to help the USPS \u201cwould amount to a poison pill,\u201d the Post reported. A congressional staffer told the newspaper the Republican-led Senate would not vote to extend more federal dollars to an agency \u201cunlikely to make good on its borrowing\u201d.\nFor decades, conservative Republicans have pushed for USPS to privatize its delivery services, a move they argue would appropriately remove government from a service that should be left to the private commercial market. Meanwhile, opponents fear dismantling universal mail service would disproportionately affect millions of Americans who live in rural areas, where private companies such as FedEx and UPS either charge higher rates or do no shipments at all.\nSince the early days of his presidential election, Trump has taken aim at the Postal Service,\u00a0once calling the agency Amazon\u2019s \u201cdelivery boy\u201d in a tweet. Some lawmakers, postal union representatives, and other supporters worry those types of remarks are a political performance behind the longstanding effort to push the mail carrier toward privatization \u2014 which the federal government could do by leveraging federal-loan dollars or forcing USPS to file bankruptcy.\n\u2018Right now, I see a big danger for our country in the form of the administration\u2019s interest in privatizing the post office,\u2019 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters after Trump called USPS \u2018a joke\u2019 on April 24. \u2018This is just about somebody on the outside making money off the post office instead of recognizing the important role [it] plays.\u2019\nAmong those services, USPS and its database of every American\u2019s postal information plays a critical role in local, state, and federal elections. About one-third of states allow voters to cast ballots by mail in elections if they have certain disabilities or travel plans for Election Day, while a handful of states allow all residents to mail in their ballots. But in 2020, under rules to limit in-person contact, lawmakers are exploring proposals that would establish vote-by-mail systems in all states for the year\u2019s presidential election.\nTrump has long opposed vote-by-mail initiatives, falsely claiming that they lead to an increase in voter fraud. He has stated: If the U.S. transitioned to all-mail voting, \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again,\u201d yet election experts have said there is no evidence to support that argument.\nIn sum, given the Postal Service\u2019s massive debt before the global COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the opportunities by federal leaders to provide economic relief for USPS, and USPS leaders\u2019 lack of clarity on what would happen if the agency did \u201crun out of cash\u201d this year, we rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: The U.S. economic downturn due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 was forcing the United States Postal Service to close.

This will be an expansion of Starbucks\u2019 already-existing presence in China, where the chain has been doing business since 1999. Starbucks already has 4,200 stores in 177 cities in mainland China, with a total of 57,000 employees.\nSo, while the expansion will indeed create more jobs in China, it\u2019s not as if the company is shipping American jobs overseas. Instead, the new roasting facility is geared toward making beans for coffee drinkers purchasing the beverage locally in Asia. The announcement from Starbucks reads:\nStarbucks Coffee Company, the global roaster and retailer of specialty coffee, announced today it will invest approximately $130 million (USD) in China to open a state-of-the-art roasting facility in 2022 as part of its new Coffee Innovation Park (CIP). As Starbucks largest manufacturing investment outside of the U.S. and its first in Asia, the CIP will incorporate a roasting plant, warehouse and distribution center, creating highly-skilled jobs and new career opportunities that will further drive smart and sustainable coffee manufacturing in China. The plant will serve as a key component of the Company\u2019s global roasting network, and the bold infrastructure investment further deepens Starbucks multi-decade commitment to strengthen the specialty coffee industry in China, where it aims to have 6,000 stores by 2022.\nChina Daily, an English-language, government-run newspaper, reported that the Coffee Innovation Park is slated to be built in Kunshan, a city in China\u2019s eastern Jiangsu province.

The LGBTQ Nation article mentioned in the above-displayed tweet is referring to the website WhiteHouseGiftShop.com. Although this website is selling coronavirus commemorative coins, and it does call itself the \u201cWhite House Gift Shop,\u201d it is not officially affiliated with U.S. President Donald Trump, the U.S. government, or the White House.\u00a0\nThe LGBTQ Nation article acknowledges this in its closing paragraphs:\nThe White House Gift Shop is a controversial business that is only tangentially related to the actual White House. At one point it was affiliated with the Secret Service, but the trademark is held by a private individual, Anthony Giannini.\nGiannini describes himself as non-partisan, but admits he is a Trump supporter.\nWhen we reached out to Anthony Giannini, the owner of WhiteHouseGiftShop.com, he confirmed to us that the \u201cWhite House is not selling coronavirus coins\u201d and that the White House Gift Shop \u201cis not affiliated with The White House, nor is The White House involved in any of our decisions, products, or operations.\u201d\nWhiteHouseGiftShop.com has a long and convoluted history that can reportedly be traced back to the Truman administration in the 1940s. Giannini told us that this gift shop program has gone through several iterations over the years and over time has become further removed from the U.S. government. In 2012, Giannini says, ownership of the White House Gift Shop was officially transferred to his corporation and in 2016 he was awarded a trademark for the White House Gift Shop name.\u00a0\nWhile the WhiteHouseGiftShop.com may trace its history back to the 1940s, and while this organization may have been at one time affiliated with the U.S. government, as of this writing in 2020, the WhiteHouseGiftShop.com is a privately run website with no official connections to the White House.\u00a0\nGiannini said:\u00a0\nIn 2012, USSS (United States Secret Service) agents and officers were no longer able to volunteer to staff The White House Gift Shop, the \u201conly original official\u201d White House Gift Shop in U.S. history. It was at this time that USSS/UDBF granted control and ultimately of WHGS to one of my own corporations consistent with all the normal transfer of rights and provenance. One logical reason for this transition was my historical role as the principal benefactor for many years to the USSS Uniformed Division Fund and the 24/7 days and nights I gave to assuring the preservation of this unique entity.\nFrom 2012 to 2016, we began the long journey of securing U.S. trademarks, primary, exclusive, to the use of the name the White House Gift Shop. Yes, we had to prove our historical relationship to the director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We accomplished this during the administration of President Barack Obama whose administration was gracious to WHGS.\nIn 2016, we were granted primary, exclusive trademarks to the name the White House Gift Shop, Est. 1946 and the White House Gift Shop. The granting of trademark rights was based on the historical connection to The White House. For the first time in history, a private entity received trademark protections based on its association with The White House, as stated by some not so friendly writers relative to WHGS, writers, however, who never bothered to contact me.\nSo, here we are, presently, operating WHGS without a break in service from its inception in 1946, its online presence in 1998, and for me, thru three administrations now, precedent, as it were. I have personally created gifts for former presidents both Democrat and Republican.\nIt should also be noted that all of the proceeds from these coronavirus commemorative coins, according to Giannini, will be donated to COVID-19 research hospitals and the NYPD.\nGiannini told us that he created the \u201cWorld Vs Virus\u201d COVID-19 commemorative coins to raise money for John Hopkins Hospital where his wife, Helen, is being treated for leukemia.\u00a0\nGiannini wrote:\nTwo months ago, we realized she would be fighting for her life with blood cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2026. It is for the above reasons that I was moved to create the COVID-19 memorial coin, WORLD vs VIRUS \u2014 with every penny of proceeds donated to Johns Hopkins, two other medical research centers, and some donations to LE first responders.\n[\u2026]\nThe coin is now nearly sold-out. When accounts settle in May, we will donate $100,000.00 of which Johns Hopkins Medical Center will be a principal recipient. I have watched her medical team, led by pioneer bone marrow transplant expert, Dr. Richard J. Jones, MD, Director of Bone Marrow Transplant at Kimmel Cancer Center \u2013 protect her as soldiers protect civilians, in her case, from the onslaught of COVID-19 and the worst possible blood cancer that strikes tens of thousands of children even more than adults.\nI pray the coin sells-out tonight to get these funds to America\u2019s real heroes.\nIn short, the website WhiteHouseGiftShop.com is truly selling COVID-19 commemorative coins. However, although this website may have a historical connection to the White House, is it not currently affiliated with the president, the United States government, or the White House.\u00a0\nOfficial commemorative coins are produced by the United States Mint. A variety of coins are scheduled to be released this year, including one celebrating American Samoa and a set dedicated to the Founding Fathers, but the U.S. Mint has not announced any coins to \u201ccommemorate\u201d the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: The White House Gift Shop is selling coronavirus commemorative coins.

Kennedy, Jr. and published between 1995 and 2001. Although this issue does feature a lengthy interview with Gates, the quote featured here comes from an entirely different article.\u00a0\nThe February 1997 issue of George magazine included a \u201cSurvival Guide to the Future\u201d that featured various commentators describing how the world was \u201cnow\u201d and providing their thoughts on what the world would be like in 2020. The actual article, titled \u201cA Nation\u2019s Future Foretold,\u201d was divided into themed sections such as transportation, education, environment, crime, warfare, and food. The quote shown in the viral image comes from the disease section of this article. Here\u2019s a screenshot from a digital copy of the magazine, which more clearly shows the author of this text:\n\nThe end of the article comes after a page break, where you can read the pull-quote in context:\n\nGates did not write that an \u201cover-populated planet\u201d would be \u201cchoked to extinction by a lung-attacking virus.\u201d This article was actually written by poet and science writer Arno Karlen.\u00a0\nHowever, social media users did find an actual quote from Gates in this issue of George that they presented as equally controversial as the \u201clung-attacking virus\u201d quote.\u00a0 A second image showing an excerpt from this issue appears to show Gates talking about \u201cfunding population control\u201d:\nThis, again, is a genuine image from the February 1997 issue of George magazine. And this time, it is a genuine quote from Gates. He made this comment shortly after he was asked about how he keeps his personal opinions separate from his business decisions:\n\nWhile this quote is often shared as if it revealed some secret and nefarious plot from the former Microsoft CEO, the truth is a bit more mundane.\u00a0\nThis quote was widely circulated by those who adhere to the idea that Gates was using the COVID-19 pandemic to give himself an opportunity to microchip the population via vaccines. The above-displayed quote shows, according to proponents of this conspiracy theory, that Gates has long been planning to take control of the global population. We took a deeper look into the \u201cID2020\u201d conspiracy theory here.\nHowever, the term \u201cpopulation control\u201d isn\u2019t as literal as it may seem in this context. This term was widely used in the 1970s and \u201980s, but it fell out of fashion in the \u201990s and was replaced by terms such as \u201creproductive health,\u201d \u201cfamily planning,\u201d and \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment.\u201d\nIn writing about the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development in 1994, the Christian Science Monitor noted a major philosophical difference between that year\u2019s conference and conferences from years past:\nIf there is a major philosophical difference in the 1994 version of the once-a-decade international conference on population, it is the shift from \u201cpopulation control\u201d to \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment\u201d \u2014 especially in areas of reproductive health, education, and economic opportunities, which planners of the UN conference see as closely linked to fertility rates.\n\u201cEconomic growth and improvement of quality of life have been fastest in those areas where women have higher status, and slowest where they face the greatest disadvantages,\u201d states the draft \u201cProgramme of Action\u201d now being debated in New York.\nGates\u2019 quote in this 1997 interview may have been a bit outdated, but it was not indicative of a nefarious plot to enslave humankind. Rather, Gates was noting his charitable work with global organizations that support reproductive health programs.\u00a0\nFor example, in 1997, the year this interview was published, the Gates Foundation awarded a $2.2 million grant to Johns Hopkins University to \u201csupport the Institute for Population and Reproductive Health to strengthen leadership and institutions in the developing countries.\u201d Two years later in 1999, Bill and Melinda Gates donated $2.2 billion to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\nForbes explored Gates\u2019 thinking on \u201cpopulation control\u201d in a 2011 profile:\nThat same epiphany for his public health philanthropy came even earlier. Bill\u2019s dad had set up a dinner at Seattle\u2019s posh Columbia Tower Club with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). While the meeting started with birth control \u2014 among other efforts, PATH taught Chinese condom makers to test their products before shipping them \u2014 Gates began consuming data that startled him. In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls \u2014 specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people \u2014 the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. \u201cIt goes against common sense,\u201d Gates says. Most parents don\u2019t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die.\n\u201cIf a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,\u201d\u2008says Melinda.\nIn terms of giving, Gates did a 180-degree turn. Rather than prevent births, he would aim his billions at saving the kids already born. \u201cWe moved pretty heavily into vaccines once we understood that,\u201d says Gates. Evaluate the following assertion: Bill Gates is quoted in the February 1997 issue of George magazine as saying an \"over-populated planet\" would be \"choked to extinction by a lung-attacking virus.\" If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

And a vaccine to fight coronaviruses that have infected dogs won\u2019t work on COVID-19 in humans.\nThe confusion seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the word \u201ccoronavirus,\u201d which actually refers to a family of hundreds of viruses, not just one type of sickness. Politicians and journalists frequently \u2014 and misleadingly \u2014 used the term in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the novel coronavirus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.\nBut the reality is this: Most of us will catch at least one type of coronavirus in our lifetime and suffer cold-like symptoms while others may suffer more severe and sometimes fatal infections, including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Listing all of the types of coronaviruses that can cause disease in humans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states:\nCoronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. There are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.\nHuman coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. [There are] seven coronaviruses that can infect people [\u2026].\nOne of the seven is SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 the strain for which epidemiologists are scrambling to create a vaccine to end the 2019-2020 global health crisis.\nMeanwhile, some types of coronaviruses cause illness in animals, including cattle, camels, cats, and dogs. Of that type, some remain exclusively in the animal world, while others \u2014 on rare occasions \u2014 mutate in such a way that allows them to infect humans, according to the CDC. That was the case with the COVID-19 outbreak, though scientists have yet to pinpoint the exact source of the virus as of this writing.\nThe popular Facebook photo does show a real vaccine used to help dogs fight a specific strain of coronavirus unique to that species. The type of shot, however, is not effective in humans and will not help scientists fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe vaccine, called Nobivac Canine 1-Cv, is \u201cdesigned to enhance the immune response and offer protection against canine coronavirus,\u201d according to Merck Animal Health, which is the manufacturer of the vaccine. The product is \u201capproved for the vaccination of healthy dogs as an aid in the prevention of disease caused by canine coronavirus infection,\u201d which can cause intestinal and respiratory sickness.\nThe manufacturer\u2019s website also states canine coronaviruses \u201care not the same virus as SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for causing the COVID-19 infection\u201d \u2014 the same web page includes an image of a product that looks similar to the one featured in the viral Facebook post.\nAlthough government officials and the news media often referred to the virus at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic as simply \u201ccoronavirus\u201d in the early days of the outbreak, scientists have urged the use of a more accurate name. According to the World Health Organization, the virus is called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the disease it causes is referred to as COVID-19.\u00a0\nIn conclusion, the word \u201ccoronavirus\u201d refers to a group of viruses, and any vaccine that has been effective fighting the spread of one particular strain of the virus family \u2014 including canine coronavirus, MERS, or SARS \u2014 is not necessarily going to provide immunity against other variations in this group. As of May 4, 2020 no vaccine exists for SARS-CoV-2. And for these reasons, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: A viral photograph showing a canine coronavirus vaccine demonstrates that there should already exist a human vaccine for COVID-19.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In late May 2020, social media users shared a meme that contained a misleading claim about the state of California. The meme said the state had announced it would give undocumented residents a stimulus payment on the same day it said it would lay off first responders due to diminished state funds resulting from the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, implying the two events are causally linked.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom on April 15, 2020, acknowledged undocumented residents paid $2.5 billion in state and local taxes in 2019. He then announced the state would draw up a total of $125 million sourced from charitable donations and taxpayer funds to provide $500 stimulus payments to those residents. That was because they didn\u2019t qualify to receive federal stimulus checks under the CARES Act, a relief package meant to blunt the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis announcement was unrelated to another statement Newsom made more than a month later. In the latter, he urged the federal government to provide financial assistance to states and local governments struggling with economic shortfalls to their operating budgets due to forced business closures during the pandemic. In an interview on CNN on May 21, Newsom stated that without federal help, cities and counties may be forced to lay off first responders.\n\u201cThe next time they want to salute our heroes, our first responders, our police officers and firefighters, consider the fact that they are the first ones to be laid off by cities and counties,\u201d Newsom said when asked by CNN host Jake Tapper what would happen if the federal government failed to bail out states and local governments. \u201cThe folks who are out there, the true heroes of this pandemic, are health care workers and nurses. Those county health systems have been ravaged, their budgets have been devastated and depleted, the budget accounts depleted since this pandemic.\u201d\nBudgets that deal with first responders like police, firefighters, and paramedics are generally administered by local governments, meaning it would be cities and counties in California, not the state itself, that would have discretion over whether or when to cut those services. Furthermore, Newsom didn\u2019t \u201cannounce\u201d such layoffs would take place; he simply suggested cuts may occur in the absence of intervention from the federal government to financially shore up local governments.\nAs of late May, California was facing a $54 billion budget shortfall resulting from economic fallout of stay-at-home orders that forced shuttering of most commerce beginning in mid-March, in an effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 disease. The state one year earlier had a surplus of $21 billion.\nIn sum, Newsom didn\u2019t \u201cannounce\u201d layoffs for first responders but instead projected that layoffs at the local level were a looming possibility. He also didn\u2019t make the statement on the same day that he announced California would commit $125 million ($75 million of which would come from taxpayers) to give undocumented state residents $500 stimulus payments. The two events are unrelated, although the meme attempted to link them causally. We therefore rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: On the same day California announced it would provide some undocumented residents COVID-19 stimulus payments, it also announced it would lay off first responders because of a lack of funds.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: A meme about New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was making the rounds in May 2020 that criticized his management of COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic patients in New York and the resources at his disposal. The meme said, \u201cWhile the USNS Comfort sat in New York empty and unused, Andrew Cuomo mandated nursing homes to take COVID patients.\u201d\u00a0\nThe reality is a bit more complicated. While Cuomo did indeed direct that COVID-19 patients be sent to nursing homes to help ease the burden on hospitals, the underutilization of the USNS Comfort was due to a wide range of factors.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn March 25, Cuomo and the state New York Health Department directed that recovering COVID-19 patients be discharged from hospitals and sent to nursing homes. At least 4,500 patients were sent to \u201calready vulnerable\u201d nursing homes, according to data compiled by The Associated Press (AP). Many blamed the controversial order for more than 5,800 deaths in nursing and adult care facilities in New York, more than in any other state.\u00a0\nThat order, from the office of New York State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker, came amid a \u201cscramble to provide more hospital beds.\u201d The order said:\u00a0\nThere is an urgent need to expand hospital capacity in New York State to be able to meet the demand for patients with COVID-19 requiring acute care. As a result, this directive is being issued to clarify expectations for nursing homes (NHs) receiving residents returning from hospitalization and for NHs accepting new admissions.\nThe plan, according to AP, quickly came under attack:\n\u201cIt was the single dumbest decision anyone could make if they wanted to kill people,\u201d Daniel Arbeeny said of the directive, which prompted him to pull his 88-year-old father out of a Brooklyn nursing home where more than 50 people have died. His father later died of COVID-19 at home.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t rocket science,\u201d Arbeeny said. \u201cWe knew the most vulnerable \u2014 the elderly and compromised \u2014 are in nursing homes and rehab centers.\u201d\nOn May 10, Cuomo reversed the order, saying now only patients who tested negative for the virus could be released to nursing homes. He continued to defend the decision, arguing he was following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines. He also said:\u00a0\n\u201cAny nursing home could just say, \u2018I can\u2019t handle a COVID person in my facility,\u2019\u201d he said, although the March 25 order didn\u2019t specify how homes could refuse, saying that \u201dno resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the (nursing home) solely based\u201d on confirmed or suspected COVID-19.\nMeanwhile, at the end of March, according to The New York Times, the USNS Comfort was sent to New York City to aid hospitals overburdened with COVID-19 patients by taking on non-coronavirus cases. U.S. President Donald Trump himself oversaw the ship\u2019s departure from Norfolk, Virginia. But on April 2, the 1,000-bed facility only had 20 patients.\u00a0\nA combination of military protocols and bureaucratic hurdles prevented the ship from accepting many patients, frustrating many hospital leaders. The New York Times report outlined the hurdles that restricted patient intake in early April:\u00a0\nOn top of its strict rules preventing people infected with the virus from coming on board, the Navy is also refusing to treat a host of other conditions. Guidelines disseminated to hospitals included a list of 49 medical conditions that would exclude a patient from admittance to the ship.\nAmbulances cannot take patients directly to the Comfort; they must first deliver patients to a city hospital for a lengthy evaluation \u2014 including a test for the virus \u2014 and then pick them up again for transport to the ship.\nAt the same time, according to the Times, the number of non-COVID-19 patients in New York City hospitals had dropped:\u00a0\n\u2026 there is not a high volume of noncoronavirus patients. Because most New Yorkers have isolated themselves in their homes, there are fewer injuries from car accidents, gun shots and construction accidents that would require an emergency room visit.\nMichael Dowling, head of New York\u2019s largest hospital system, expressed his frustration over the hurdles getting patients to the hospital ship:\nUltimately, Mr. Dowling and others said, if the Comfort refuses to take Covid patients, there are few patients to send. And given the pernicious spread of the disease in New York City, where nearly 50,000 were infected as of Thursday, dividing patients into those who have it and those who do not is pointless, he said.\nThe solution, he and others said, was to open the Comfort to patients with Covid-19.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to help us with the people we need help with, what\u2019s the purpose?\u201d\nOn April 6, Cuomo asked Trump for permission to treat coronavirus patients on the ship. Trump agreed, and the Navy reconfigured the ship into a 500-bed hospital so it could space out patients to avoid spreading the disease. But on that same day, a crew member tested positive for the disease, even after the crew had been ordered to quarantine for two weeks before their departure for New York. The number of infected grew to four in the following weeks. By April 21, the ship had treated only 179 patients, not even close to its capacity.\u00a0\nTrump acknowledged during a White House briefing that the reason the ship wasn\u2019t put to much use was because its arrival coincided with the opening of a military-supported temporary hospital at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. A commander of the Comfort\u2019s task force supporting the COVID-19 mission in New York City echoed the sentiment:\nCombined, \u201cwe made a pretty significant impact,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cBut the reality is the hospitals were able to double the number of ICU beds almost in the time that we were here.\u201d\n\u201cWe had the extra capacity \u2013 if it was needed \u2013 and fortunately it wasn\u2019t needed,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I think that is a win.\u201d\nThe Javits center\u2019s makeshift hospital treated around 1,000 patients during its run, and was closed by May 1 after it appeared that New York City was past the peak of the pandemic. Days before, Cuomo met Trump at the White House, where the president asked him about relocating the Comfort back to its base where it could be dispatched to other locations. Cuomo later told MSNBC that the state no longer needed the hospital ship. Barely a month after the ship arrived in New York, it returned to Norfolk.\u00a0\nIn summary, Cuomo\u2019s administration did issue a controversial directive that sent recovering COVID-19 patients to nursing homes, which may have contributed to a spike in COVID-19-related deaths in those facilities. Officials reversed the order in May. The USNS Comfort\u2019s inability to take in more patients was due to a combination of bureaucratic hurdles for New York City hospitals who found it difficult to send patients to the ship in the first place. Even after the ship opened up to treating COVID-19 patients, it was still unable to fill all of its beds. Therefore, we rate this claim as a \u201cMixture.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered thousands of COVID-19 patients to be sent to nursing homes, while the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship sent to New York to help treat patients, sat empty and unused.

Bodenstedt\u2019s connection to Wendy\u2019s is known: His company owns hundreds of Wendy\u2019s, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut franchises across the country.\u00a0\nIn May, a Business Insider report revealed that Bodenstedt donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump\u2019s campaign.\u00a0\nAccording to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings, since 2018, Bodenstedt has donated around $440,000 to Trump\u2019s campaign, including a March 12, 2020, donation of $200,000 to the Trump Victory PAC (political action committee).

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a fake news detection task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In June 2020, as demonstrations swept across the U.S. in response to the police-custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and protesters called for the \u201cdefunding of police departments, social media users circulated a meme asserting that German dictator Adolf Hitler had similarly defunded and eliminated police departments so as to better control elections:\n\nBut the essence of this meme was contrary to historical fact. As the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum observed, neither \u201ca wholesale purge nor a wholesale resignation of policemen\u201d occurred in Germany during the Nazi era:\nThe Nazis came to power in Germany in January 1933 and established a dictatorship, ending the 12-year German experiment with democracy, the Weimar Republic. Yet the police, who had been charged with defending the Weimar Republic, were integrated relatively easily into the Nazi regime. There was neither a wholesale purge nor a wholesale resignation of policemen.\nMost policemen in 1933 were not Nazis, though they were overwhelmingly conservative. They thought of themselves as neutral professionals and as impartial servants of the law. Their personal politics were supposed to be irrelevant to their duties. Yet members of the police proved willing to support a Nazi government that destroyed democracy in Germany. The police in particular and conservatives in general supported the Nazis in 1933. Conservatives came to view a Nazi dictatorship as a solution not just to the weaknesses of the Weimar Republic but to a whole series of professional difficulties peculiar to the police.\nIn a separate article, the Museum noted that \u201cHitler posed as a champion of law and order\u201d and maintained the trust of the police because the \u201cNazi state in fact alleviated many of the frustrations the police [had previously] experienced\u201d:\nWhen the Nazis came to power in January 1933, many policemen remained skeptical of the party and its intentions. Nazi agitation, especially in the latter years of the Weimar Republic, had been subversive and the police had been investigating both the Nazis and the Communists with vigor. Nevertheless, Adolf Hitler posed as a champion of law and order, claiming he would uphold traditional German values. The police and many other conservatives looked forward to the extension of police power promised by a strong centralized state, welcomed the end of factional politics, and agreed to end democracy.\nThe Nazi state in fact alleviated many of the frustrations the police experienced in the Weimar Republic. The Nazis shielded the police from public criticism by censoring the press. They ended street fighting by eliminating the Communist threat. Police manpower was even extended by the incorporation of Nazi paramilitary organizations as auxiliary policemen. The Nazis centralized and fully funded the police to better combat criminal gangs and promote state security. The Nazi state increased staff and training, and modernized police equipment. The Nazis offered the police the broadest latitude in arrests, incarceration, and the treatment of prisoners. The police moved to take \u201cpreventive action,\u201d that is, to make arrests without the evidence required for a conviction in court and indeed without court supervision at all.\nThe Sturmabteilung (SA), also known as \u201cbrownshirts\u201d or \u201cstormtroopers,\u201d were the Nazi Party\u2019s paramilitary wing, and the SA did disrupt meetings of, and wage terror campaigns against, opposing political parties. However, that activity primarily took place before Hitler became chancellor of Germany and the Nazi Party seized control of the country in January 1933, as Germany subsequently held only one more contested federal election, which took place in March 1933. After that, Hitler \u2014 spurred by G\u00f6ring \u2014 grew increasingly mistrustful of the SA and purged its leadership during the \u201cNight of the Long Knives\u201d several months later. Evaluate the following assertion: Upon assuming power in Germany, Hitler ordered the defunding and elimination of police departments.

The announcement of the rally\u2019s location also sparked controversy because Tulsa was the site of the 1921 massacre of hundreds of Black people by a white mob.\nGee, I wonder what event this could be for. pic.twitter.com/FNtAuB6fgc\n\u2014 Sophie Goldstein (@RedInkRadio) June 15, 2020\n\nThe ad also placed the location for the gig at \u201cThird St near Denver Ave,\u201d which is across the street from the Bok Center where Trump\u2019s rally will be held.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In the spring of 2020, as protests against racial injustice and police brutality swept across the U.S. following the death of a Black man in police custody, online trolls started to spread racist propaganda in an attempt to smear the Black Lives Matter movement. Generally speaking, these posts made inflammatory and violent claims, then falsely attributed them to BLM.\nFor example, one such hoax held that\u00a0BLM protesters were going to \u201cassassinate white families.\u201d\u00a0\nIn June 2020, Snopes came across yet another flyer falsely attributed to Black Lives Matter that labeled white men, women, and children as \u201cthe enemy\u201d:\n\nBut this is not a genuine flyer issued or endorsed by Black Lives Matter. This is a piece of racist propaganda that was created in an apparent attempt to smear BLM and heighten racial tensions.\u00a0\nIt isn\u2019t clear who created this fake poster. The earliest posting that we could find was from June 11, 2020, from a Twitter account devoted to QAnon, a wide-ranging and far-right conspiracy theory based almost entirely on anonymous social media posts that claim a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot exists against President Donald Trump. From there, it was shared to the Russian site Aftershock.news; an All Lives Matter\u00a0account; and an\u00a0account\u00a0adorned with British flags, where it received thousands of retweets.\nWhile we\u2019ve found several accounts sharing this flyer along with messages denigrating Black Lives Matter, we\u2019ve yet to see any accounts connected to the Black Lives Matter movement sharing this flyer in earnest.\u00a0\nIn addition to the fact that this flyer originated with posters critical of BLM \u2014 and not with BLM accounts spreading this message in earnest \u2014 the statements on this flyer are also contrary to the positions of the Black Lives Matter movement. Nowhere on the Black Lives Matter website are white people identified as \u201cenemies,\u201d and the website is void of any calls to violence against white people.\u00a0\nBLM has also not called for \u201cre-education camps,\u201d for \u201cBlack power\u201d to run the government, or for white people to stop dating outside their race. The official Black Lives Matter website has put out a list of \u201cdemands,\u201d but that list has practically nothing in common with the viral hoax shown above. The official list from Black Lives Matter calls for an end to systematic racism and for the national defunding of police:\nWe call for an end to the systemic racism that allows this culture of corruption to go unchecked and our lives to be taken.\nWe call for a national defunding of police. We demand investment in our communities and the resources to ensure Black people not only survive, but thrive. If you\u2019re with us, add your name to the petition right now and help us spread the word.\nThe \u201cdemands\u201d on the hoax flyer did not originate with BLM. The items on this list are examples of what someone who is unfamiliar with the Black Lives Matter movement may fear are central tenets of this group.\nWhen a similar fake flyer was found in England, a local BLM activist told Scotland\u2019s Evening Telegraph:\nJoy Gansh, a local BLM activist, believes the display was created by people trying to discredit the movement.\nShe said: \u201cThings like that, after what happened with the George Floyd mural being defaced, I think that\u2019s something that a white supremacist would put up to discredit us.\n\u201cNobody that I\u2019ve seen advocating for the BLM movement would think that that is appropriate. My personal opinion is that this is people being framed. This is a way to make us seem in the wrong.\u201d\nThe art student, who plans to organise a BLM march in Dundee soon, believes that \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d are using false posters to encourage violence.\n\u201cPeople that hold those kinds of beliefs aren\u2019t part of this movement,\u201d she added. \u201cThis seems like a way to stop us in our tracks and make us seem violent so they can come back with violence. We aren\u2019t here for violence, we\u2019re just here for justice and equality in all aspects of life.\u201d\nThis fake flyer, as well as similar items, have been pushed on internet forums such as 4chan in an explicit attempt to smear the Black Lives Matter movement. In one post, for example, a 4chan poster states that \u201cpeople are falling for this [hoax flyer], let\u2019s kick it into overdrive.\u201d In another thread, users exchange various fake BLM posters and encourage each other to share them. In another thread, a user gives instructions on how to make and spread this racist propaganda:\nThe only thing maintaining the completely bizarre state of affairs the USA and the world is in right now is the fact that some white people still think they can be on the \u201cright side of history\u201d by kneeling for the Noseberg-controlled BLM movement. We can destroy their whole plan. Make propaganda posters and spread them around. If enough whites realize that blacks will never ever feel that anything is \u201cenough\u201d, they\u2019ll abandon the movement. It\u2019ll crash and burn.

However, it actually came from Earnhardt\u2019s daughter, Kelley, not his son, Dale Jr.\u00a0\nThe anecdote can be heard in an April 2015 episode of the \u201cFast Lane Family\u201d podcast. The episode featured a Q&A with Kelley Earnhardt Miller about her father on what would have been his 64th birthday. She prefaced the story by saying that it was a good example of her dad\u2019s heart and how he cared for people.\u00a0\nShe said:\u00a0\n\u201cOn my dad\u2019s truck, he had this sticker with a rebel flag that said \u2018American by birth, Southern by the grace of God\u2019 or something like that, you know, had a rebel flag on it. At the time, we had a lot of different nannies that took care of us and we had this housekeeper named Ann, and she was the most awesome lady. She was an African-American lady, and she asked my stepmother about my dad\u2019s rebel flag on the back of his truck.\n\u201cAnd so the next thing we know my dad\u2019s out there with a knife and a razor blade, and he\u2019s cutting the rebel flag out of the sticker, he left \u201cAmerican by birth\u201d but he didn\u2019t want to offend anybody or make anybody mad in that manner. It was so sweet. It was a little kind-hearted thing. She just thought that was the best. She\u2019s like, \u2018That\u2019s just so awesome that you would do that.\u2019 He had a good heart.\u201d\nShe tells this story around the 24:30 mark of the following audio:\n\nA few months after the episode aired, Dale Earnhardt Jr., also a famous race-car driver, said he, too, was against the display of the Confederate flag. At the time, in June 2015, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was calling for the removal of the Confederate flag from the state house, and NASCAR had endorsed that position.\u00a0\nEarnhardt Jr. said:\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve made my comments about the Confederate flag several times, and I stand behind NASCAR\u2019s stance to remove it \u2026 I think if it\u2019s offensive to an entire race, it really does nothing for anybody to be there flying. It belongs in the history books, that\u2019s about it.\u2019\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: Dale Earnhardt Jr. told a story about his late father, Dale Earnhardt Sr., removing a Confederate-flag sticker from his truck.

When the above-displayed video went viral \u2014 in the midst of nationwide protests after the death of a Black man in police custody in Minneapolis \u2014 it prompted some people to accuse Cathy of being racist against white people:\n\n\nAlthough this is a genuine video of Cathy shining the shoes of a Black man, the above-displayed headlines do not relay direct quotes from Cathy. In the video, Cathy invites all people, not just white people, to shine the shoes of anyone (not just Black people).\nThe video was taken at Passion City Church in Atlanta, Georgia, and shows Cathy, Lecrae, and Pastor Louie Giglio talking about racism. Cathy tells a story about a revival that was held in a small town in Texas with a history of racism. A young man in attendance, according to Cathy, was so moved by the anti-racism message of the sermon that he went over to an older Black man and started to shine his shoes.\u00a0\nCathy then says:\u00a0\nI invite folks just to put some words to action here and if we need to find somebody that needs to have their shoes shined, we need to just go right on over and shine their shoes. Whether they got tennis shoes on or not \u2014 maybe they got sandals on \u2014 it really doesn\u2019t matter. But, there\u2019s a time in which we need to have some personal action here. Maybe we need to give them a hug, too.\nI bought about 1,500 of these [brushes] and I gave them to all our Chick-Fil-A operators and staff a number of years ago. So, any expressions of a contrite heart, of a sense of humility, a sense of shame, a sense of embarrassment begat with an apologetic heart \u2014 I think that\u2019s what our world needs to hear today.\nThe full video is below (the story starts around the 38:35 mark):\nCathy was clearly talking about how to counteract racism when he made these messages. However, Cathy did not literally say that \u201cwhite people should shine black\u2019s shoes to show sense of shame for racism.\u201d In fact, it appears that \u201cshining shoes\u201d was a symbolic gesture to illustrate Cathy\u2019s larger point: that the world needs to take action to combat racism, and that those actions need to begin with an apologetic heart.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy said white people should shine the shoes of Black people in order to show shame about racism.

Shortly thereafter, a social media post started to circulate that claimed the investigation was over because NASCAR discovered Wallace had actually mistook a serpentine belt for a noose.\u00a0 This is not a genuine news story \u2014 Wallace did not mistake a serpentine belt for a noose, and the included statement in this post from NASCAR is completely fabricated. This statement does not appear on NASCAR\u2019s website nor any of its social media profiles. In a June 21 statement, NASCAR said that it was \u201coutraged\u201d by the incident and that whoever was found responsible would be expelled from the sport:  Wallace also released a statement:  This incident occurred a few weeks after NASCAR announced that it was banning the display of the Confederate flag at all of its official events. In the wake of this decision, we\u2019ve seen several junk news stories and hoaxes about NASCAR. For instance, the sport is not banning the national anthem, prayer, military flyovers, or MAGA apparel.\u00a0\nUpdate 6/23/20 3:34 p.m. PT: After this story was published a joint statement from federal authorities announced that their investigation found the noose had been hanging in the Talladega Superspeedway garage since as early as October 2019 (long before it was assigned to Wallace) and no federal charges would be pursued.

For starters, the idea that there is a \u201cnationwide conspiracy\u201d to poison fast food orders would no doubt lead in the news, but as of this writing there were no news reports of any such widespread public health crisis. The claim in the meme is nothing more than a baseless rumor with no evidence offered. And Black Lives Matter is a national movement for social justice, not a membership-based organization, and activists who support it seek social equality and institutional reforms, not to cause physical harm to white people.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time a false rumor about poisoned food circulated in the wake of Black Lives Matter demonstrations in 2020. A New York police union claimed that officers had been poisoned at a Shake Shack, but a police investigation found no criminal activity.\nBecause this meme is a copy-and-pasted rumor with no evidence to support it, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: Black Lives Matter \"members and supporters\" are tampering with or poisoning the orders of white patrons at fast food restaurants.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In late June 2020, social media users shared an article written by anti-Muslim propagandist Robert Spencer in which he claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that \u201cAntifa and Muslim organizations plan to \u2018police Minneapolis under Muslim rule.'\u201d\nSpencer\u2019s article, which was published to the far-right website FrontPageMag, was sourced from a quote by State Rep. Steve Green, a Republican who represents a district in northwest Minnesota.\nGreen made the comment among many other grievances he aired during a meeting with the Hubbard County Board of Commissioners on June 16, 2020. The remark was initially documented in a Park Rapids Enterprise post written by another politician, State Rep. Matt Grossell, a Republican representative for a district in northwest Minnesota who was also present at the meeting.\nGrossell\u2019s post reads like a partial transcript of the two men\u2019s remarks at the meeting, and contains no corroborating evidence or reporting to support Green\u2019s claims. At one point Green indicates that in his \u201chumble opinion,\u201d they\u2019re seeing \u201ccommunism moving into Minneapolis and St. Paul.\u201d Despite a lack of evidence to support it, Green\u2019s sensational quote was picked up by a number of websites.\nWe reached out to Green by email to ask where he got this information and whether he had any evidence for his claims, but got no reply.\nWe also reached out to Minneapolis Police Sgt. John Elder, who confirmed that while the City Council did state its intent to \u201creimagine\u201d policing, the Minneapolis Police Department is still operating. \u201cWe absolutely are here and will not abandon our communities!\u201d Elder stated in an email.\nNot only is there no apparent evidence for Green\u2019s claim that antifa and Muslim groups are policing Minneapolis, but the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has called on GOP leaders to repudiate Green\u2019s statement, calling it hate-filled.\nAs the Minneapolis-based alternate newspaper CityPages reported, the Twin Cities are no stranger to Islamophobic rhetoric and violence:\nIt should go without saying that, no, people are not trying to impose \u201cMuslim rule\u201d on Minneapolis, but we kind of end up having to say it a lot. Back in April, as false rumors of mosques staying open during quarantine bounced around Facebook, Council on American-Islamic Relations executive director Jaylani Hussein called the spread of such conspiracies \u201chate-bating.\u201d\nThey might seem harlmess [sic], even laughable, until someone gets hurt. And if watching a group of Illinois men blow up a Bloomington mosque in the summer of 2017 has taught Twin Cities\u2019 Muslim communities anything, it\u2019s that they very well can.\nGreen\u2019s comments came in the aftermath of nationwide protests against structural racism and police violence after video of the in-custody death of George Floyd, a Black man, went viral in May 2020. The video showed Floyd begging for his life as former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck.\nIn the wake of sustained, international protests, Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder in Floyd\u2019s death, and three other officers at the scene were charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Minneapolis City Council also voted to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department, stating it could not be reformed.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean the police department disappeared overnight. Members of the City Council stated that the change would be gradual, and that they are still in the process of laying the groundwork for what the future holds for public safety in Minneapolis.\nAs some of the earlier protests had turned violent, U.S. President Donald Trump and his allies had sought to blame \u201cantifa\u201d without evidence. As The New York Times noted, \u201cantifa, a contraction of the phrase \u2018anti-fascist,\u2019 is not an organization with a leader, a defined structure or membership roles\u201d but rather \u201cantifa is more of a movement of activists whose followers share a philosophy and tactics.\u201d\nBecause there\u2019s no evidence for Green\u2019s comments and because the Minneapolis Police Department continues to patrol the city and respond to emergencies as city leaders hash out the future for public safety, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: Antifa and Muslim organizations in summer of 2020 were planning to police the streets of Minneapolis under Muslim rule.

The encounter escalated, McClain was put in a chokehold, and a few days later he was dead.\nThe Denver Post reported:\nElijah McClain, 23, was walking home from a store around 10:30 p.m. on a Saturday evening when authorities contacted him near Billings Street and Colfax Avenue in Denver. Someone had called 911 to report a \u201csuspicious person\u201d who was wearing a ski mask and waving his arms.\nMcClain routinely wore masks when he was outside because he had anemia \u2014 a blood condition \u2014 and became cold easily, according to his family.\n[\u2026]\nAfter a struggle, McClain was handcuffed and officers requested medical assistance. Aurora Fire Rescue later injected him with ketamine in an attempt to sedate him, police said. He suffered cardiac arrest during the ambulance ride to a nearby hospital.\n[\u2026]\nThe following Friday McClain was declared \u201cbrain dead\u201d and was expected to be taken off life support that afternoon, family members said. He died later that day.\nMcClain\u2019s family called for the police officers involved in his death to be prosecuted, but it was announced in November that they would not face criminal charges. McClain\u2019s case did not receive the same national attention as other similar incidents, but it was thrust back into the spotlight after George Floyd\u2019s death in May 2020, when protests against racial injustice and police violence spread across the United States.\u00a0\nIn June 2020, an image of text supposedly relaying McClain\u2019s \u201clast words\u201d started going viral on social media:\n\nThis message reads:\u00a0\nI can\u2019t breathe. I have my ID right here. My name is Elijah McClain. That\u2019s my house. I was just going home. I\u2019m an introvert. I\u2019m just different. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m so sorry. I have no gun. I don\u2019t do that stuff. I don\u2019t do any fighting. Why are you attacking me? I don\u2019t even kill flies! I don\u2019t eat meat! But I don\u2019t judge people, I don\u2019t judge people who do eat meat. Forgive me. All I was trying to do was become better. I will do it. I will do anything. Sacrifice my identity, I\u2019ll do it. You all are phenomenal. You are beautiful and I love you. Try to forgive me. I\u2019m a mood Gemini. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. Ow, that really hurt. You are all very strong. Teamwork makes the dream work. Oh, I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t trying to do that. I just can\u2019t breathe correctly.\nThis is a largely accurate transcript of what McClain said in a video recording of his encounter with police in August 2019. These remarks can be heard on the body cam footage of one of the police officers involved in the incident. An official copy of this video from the Aurora Police Department can be seen below (the relevant portion of the video starts at around the 12:30 mark).\nThe text in the viral transcript has been slightly edited to remove repeated phrases and inaudible moments (McClain says \u201cI\u2019m just different\u201d multiple times), but none of the edits are misleading. The text describing actions in the viral post \u2014 at one point noting that McClain was crying, at another noting that he vomited \u2014 are also accurate.\nThis viral transcript does omit at least one phrase uttered by McClain during this encounter. A few moments after the final words of this viral transcript, McClain says \u201cI can\u2019t fix myself\u201d before vomiting again.\u00a0\nNPR reported:\u00a0\nSomeone picks up a body camera and McClain can be seen lying on his side with both hands restrained behind his back, and one officer jamming his knee on the man\u2019s torso.\nWhen McClain attempts to roll over to vomit, they shout at him to \u201cstop fighting us.\u201d\n\u201cIf you keep messing around, I\u2019m going to bring my dog out here and he\u2019s going to bite you,\u201d says an officer standing over McClain.\nMcClain proceeds to vomit.\n\u201cI can\u2019t fix myself,\u201d he says weakly.\nMcClain\u2019s body goes limp and he passes out.\nEventually one officer asks, \u201cAre you OK?\u201d\nBut he\u2019s not asking McClain. He\u2019s speaking to the officer on top of him.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good,\u201d the officer says shifting his weight.\nWhen paramedics arrived, McClain was injected with ketamine (described by Aurora Police as \u201ca standard medication routinely utilized to reduce agitation\u201d) and then loaded into an ambulance where he suffered cardiac arrest. On August 30, McClain was pronounced brain dead, removed from life support, and died.\u00a0\nIn February 2021, an independent investigation commissioned by the city found that police officers did not have legal basis to stop McClain. The Denver Post reports:\nAurora police officers did not have a legal basis to force Elijah McClain to stop walking, to frisk him or to use a chokehold on him, an independent investigation commissioned by the city found.\nThe initial investigation into the incident led by the department\u2019s detectives in the Major Crimes Unit was also deeply flawed, the investigators found. The detectives failed to ask basic, critical questions of the officers involved in McClain\u2019s death and instead \u201cthe questions frequently appeared designed to elicit specific exonerating \u2018magic language\u2019 found in court rulings,\u201d the report states.\n[\u2026]\nAurora city officials on Monday morning released the 157-page report on the death of McClain at the hands of city police and paramedics. The city hired a panel of investigators to examine the officers\u2019 and paramedics\u2019 decision and make policy recommendations \u201cto lessen the chance of another tragedy like this one from happening again,\u201d the report states. Evaluate the following assertion: A piece of text accurately transcribes the last words of Elijah McClain in a video recording of his encounter with police officers before he died in August 2019.

Gretchen Whitmer as of this writing.\n\nIn the weeks that followed the House\u2019s decision, the website Great Game India (which was a major player in spreading misinformation about the origins of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and falsely claimed billionaire Bill Gates and the ID2020 Coalition was behind a grand surveillance plan to microchip the global population) published on July 4, 2020, for example:\nThe Michigan House of Representatives has passed a controversial bill to microchip humans voluntarily in the state under the guise of protecting their privacy. The Microchip Protection Act would allow Michigan employers to use microchipping of their workers with their consent. However, research has shown that [radio frequency identification] RFID transponders causes cancer.\nAdding to that unsubstantiated concern regarding citizens\u2019 health, a viral web page by a Michigan-based blogger alleged that the legislation posed a threat to citizens\u2019 privacy and civil rights. He wrote:\nThe bill verbage [sic] blocks employers from requiring microchips, but also creates a legitimacy for employers considering using the technology in the first place\u2026 If everyone is walking around with a unique identifier, privacy is out the window. \u2026This means anyone could track you. Stores could track your entry and exit, showing you targeted ads. Thieves could be signaled when you leave your home. Your movements and contacts could be used against you in any number of ways, including identity theft.\n\nNumerous readers reached out to Snopes in July 2020 to investigate the legitimacy of the social media and blog posts regarding the Michigan proposal. And upon our analysis of the postings, we deemed the underlying assertion to be this: The Michigan House passed legislation that would allow employers to microchip workers on a voluntary basis.\nTo fully explore that claim, here\u2019s important context: Only a few U.S.-based companies had publicized the use of radio-frequency identification tags (RFID), or microchips, in their workplace at the time of the Michigan House\u2019s vote, and none of them were believed to be in the state, according to Kahle. The technology trend among U.S businesses seemed to have emerged after Sweden office complex Epicenter began offering RFID microchip implants to employees in 2015 (we explain more below).\nSo to recap the facts, yes, the Michigan House approved a bill governing the use of microchips with a landslide vote, 104-2 (see the bill\u2019s legislative actions here), affirming the former aspect of the above-mentioned claim. Less simple, however, is the explanation for what the measure aimed to accomplish.\nTo unpack that part of critics\u2019 assertion, we reviewed the specifics of the Microchip Protection Act, House Bill No. 5672, which can be read in a PDF format here. The bill comprises five sections, as well as an introduction that describes the act\u2019s purpose as this:\n\nIn other words, the legislation would give workers or potential hires the legal grounds to sue bosses who make human microchips of any kind mandatory for employment. The bill would also establish protections for workers who do not want to use the technology and feel that their employers treated them differently compared to their pro-microchip coworkers.\nThe first two sections of the bill define terms under which those provisions apply: any situation when technology is implanted, injected, inhaled \u201cor otherwise incorporat[ed] \u2026 into the employee\u2019s or prospective employee\u2019s body.\u201d Then, in the third provision, the legislation includes the following language:\nAn employer may, as a condition of employment, as a condition of employment in a particular position, or as a condition of receiving additional compensation or other benefits, require an employee or prospective employee to comply with a court order that directs the employee or prospective employee to [have a microchip implanted].\nThat would mean if a judge for whatever reason ruled that a Michigan citizen must use a microchip (the technology could serve as a tool for probation or parole officials to track someone who is serving a criminal sentence, for instance) an employer of that individual could require him/her/them to use the device at work. The fourth section of the bill goes on to explain under what circumstances those affected employees or the court system could seek damages when or if employers violate the exception to the measure prohibiting mandatory microchipping.\nIn reference to the above-mentioned claim, however, the final part of the legislation is key: \u201cThis act does not limit an employee\u2019s or prospective employee\u2019s rights or remedies under any other state or federal law,\u201d which include laws protecting the privacy and confidentiality of citizens. Any notion that the measure would establish a legal framework for Michigan employers to microchip people against their will is completely false.\nAnd here\u2019s the fundamental misconception among people who raised concerns over the Michigan proposal: Even without the legislation, anyone in the state can already voluntarily implant themselves with the device or offer the technology to employees.\nWisconsin company Three Square Market, which specializes in vending machines and self-service software for offices, was the first widely known U.S. company to offer the devices to workers, in July 2017. There, employees can voluntarily get the devices implanted into their hands or use a wristband with the same RFID microchip to make purchases in the company\u2019s break room and use office equipment, among other things. The microchips use the same near-field communication technology utilized by contactless payment systems such as Apple Pay.\nIn early 2020, Ifeoma Ajunwa, a Cornell University labor and employment law professor who studies the use of workplace technology, told MarketWatch there are likely more American businesses that use the technology, \u201cbut they are probably not advertising it.\u201d\nSo as the technology becomes more prevalent, states are enacting new laws to regulate it. As of early 2020, more than a dozen states were either considering legislation like the Michigan bill that pertains specifically to workers\u2019 rights or were mulling more broad rules to govern the technology, or they had already passed such laws, according to analysis of state statutes on microchipping by the National Conference of State Legislatures and LexisNexis, a database of legal research.\u00a0\nAmong that minority group of U.S. states was Indiana, for instance, which established a law that took effect July 1, 2020. \u201cMicrochipping is on the rise, and Hoosiers need to be aware of their rights,\u201d said the legislation\u2019s author, Republican Rep. Alan Morrison, before the bill had passed. \u201cIt is crucial to take the necessary steps now to ensure more safety and privacy in the future.\u201d\nSimilarly, Kahle, the sponsor of the Michigan proposal, said even though the practice was relatively rare as of mid-2020, she was attempting to prepare her state for a future when and if the technology is more popular. She said in a June 24, 2020, statement:\nWith the way technology has increased over the years and as it continues to grow, it\u2019s important Michigan job providers balance the interests of the company with their employees\u2019 expectations of privacy. \u2026Microchipping has been brought up in many conversations as companies across the country are exploring cost-effective ways to increase workplace efficiency. \u2026\nDespite this type of technology not quite making its way into our state yet, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it becomes a standard business practice statewide within the next few years. \u2026We should absolutely take every step possible to get ahead of these devices.\nIn sum, while it was true that the Michigan House approved legislation governing the use of microchips, it was false to claim that the bill itself would allow employers to inject the devices \u2014 that practice was not prohibited by existing law and the in-question legislation would not suddenly permit it. Rather, the Microchip Protection Act established protections for employees who do not want to use the technology at work. For those reasons, we rate the claim \u201cMostly False.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: In June 2020, the Michigan House of Representatives passed legislation that would allow employers to microchip workers on a voluntary basis. If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

The 13th Floor post declared that \u201cThe Borghild Project was (supposedly) a super-secret attempt to stop the spread of syphilis by providing Nazi soldiers with inflatable sex dolls. That\u2019s right: Hitler invented the blow-up doll!\u201d\nHowever, the writer also acknowledged that the Borghild Project was a hoax: \u201cSadly, the evidence in support of this having actually happened is sketchy, so it probably isn\u2019t a true story. But \u2018Hitler invented the sex doll\u2019 is such an awesome idea, we should pretend it happened anyway. I mean, what\u2019s Hitler gonna do about it now, right?\u201d\nThe hoax appears to have originated with an undated post by an alleged journalist named Norbert Lenz, who hasn\u2019t published anything else. That article, entitled \u201cThe Borghild-project \u2014 a discreet matter of the III. Reich,\u201d alleged that the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden, Germany, created the dolls, which were destroyed in the Allied bombing of that city in 1945.\nWe sent an email the museum, which chronicles the history of medicine, asking about the hoax but have yet to receive a response. We\u2019ll update this article if we do.\nLaurie Marhoefer, an associate professor of history at the University of Washington, told us in an email that the hoax is built around \u201cvery real concerns [Heinrich] Himmler expressed about German men, particularly soldiers and SS men, being able to express their heterosexual sex drives, and also the syphilis prevention measures that the Nazi State took, such as regulated brothels. A lot of governments at the time did something similar. Sex dolls, however, is a hoax.\u201d\nElizabeth Heineman, a professor of history at the University of Iowa and author of the book \u201cBefore Porn Was Legal,\u201d told us there\u2019s no evidence inflatable sex dolls were even available during the World War II era.\n\u201cThe [erotica] customers were overwhelmingly veterans, and the industry had an astonishingly wide array of products on offer,\u201d Heineman told us by email. Catalogs for such items, she pointed out, \u201cwere sometimes over 150 pages long by the mid-1950s,\u201d but the items listed among those pages did not include inflatable sex dolls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that if sex dolls had existed \u2014 if men had memories of them, or if they\u2019d even heard rumors and now wanted to see one since they\u2019d returned to civilian life \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t have shown up in the erotica catalogs of the 1950s,\u201d Heineman continued. But, she added, \u201cthat\u2019s not proof they hadn\u2019t existed during the war. It\u2019s just to say that they\u2019re not showing up in a place where one would have expected to see them.\u201d\nNonetheless, there is no evidence that Hitler invented the inflatable sex doll, and claims that he did appear to be an urban legend. We therefore rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: Adolf Hitler was behind the invention of the first inflatable sex dolls. If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

These visual oddities make a bit more sense when you realize that the above-displayed image was created from a photograph of Trump and his daughter, Ivanka.\u00a0\nThe original photograph shows Trump with his daughter, who was 13 at the time.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In July 2020, Snopes received numerous inquiries from people who said they had heard U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration issued a proposal to change federal law governing homeless shelters and that that memo included an explanation for how to spot some transgender people so the facilities could deny them housing.\nMany readers included a link to an LGBTQ Nation article published July 20, 2020. People on social media circulated the same claim and link, criticizing the alleged memo as yet another example of the Trump administration\u2019s discriminatory tactics to oppress a population that\u2019s already at high risk of homelessness.\n\nThe LGBTQ Nation story alleges the federal memo \u201csays homeless shelters can use \u2018factors such as height, the presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an Adam\u2019s apple\u2019 to spot trans women\u201d during the intake process.\nYes, a proposal sponsored by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson does list those physical attributes verbatim (see below):\n\nNow, let\u2019s investigate why \u2014 was the language intended to help homeless shelters spot transgender people seeking services?\nFirst, to explore that question, we researched the circumstances under which the Trump administration was most likely to have written the alleged document. We learned via a July 1, 2020, HUD press release Carson had recently written a proposal to amend existing guidelines that govern how federally funded homeless shelters operate, and we deemed that initiative to be the most likely source of the claim\u2019s inspiration. The press release stated:\u00a0\nCarson today\u00a0announced a proposed modification\u00a0to the 2016 portion of the Equal Access rule. The Equal Access rule requires all HUD funded housing services to be provided without discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The new rule allows shelter providers that lawfully operate as single-sex or sex-segregated facilities to voluntarily establish a policy that will govern admissions determinations for situations when an individual\u2019s gender identity does not match their biological sex.\u00a0\nSome context: Housing officials under former U.S. President Barack Obama originally established the Equal Access rule, which requires homeless shelters and other facilities that receive money through the HUD\u2019s Office of Community Planning and Development to give Americans equal access to services, regardless of their gender identity or other characteristics.\nCarson\u2019s proposal primarily targeted homeless shelters and facilities within that group that keep beds, bathrooms or other spaces separate for men and women for both emergency and longer-term stays. His measure would give those places the legal authority to establish rules so only people whose biological sex corresponds with that of what the shelter serves would be granted access to services, no matter how people identify.\nNext, we obtained the memo to which the LGBTQ Nation headline and press release were referring: a 29-page document on HUD\u2019s official website titled \u201cMaking Admission or Placement Determinations Based on Sex in Facilities Under Community Planning and Development Housing Programs.\u201d The docket was signed by Carson, a former neurosurgeon whom Trump appointed to lead HUD in 2016.\nThe document details the specifics of his proposal, as well as his rationale for introducing it, amid a series of unrelated initiatives by the Trump administration to weaken federal protections for transgender Americans.\u00a0\n\nThe in-question measure, on which HUD was currently soliciting public feedback and so far not finalized as of this writing, would change existing guidelines that, the document alleged, Obama\u2019s administration enacted in violation of administrative law and \u201cminimized local control, burdened religious organizations, manifested privacy issues, and imposed regulatory burdens.\u201d The proposal reads:\nIf a single-sex facility permissibly provides accommodation for women, and its policy is to serve only biological women, without regard to gender identity, it may decline to accommodate a person who identifies as female but who is a biological male. Conversely, the same shelter may not, on the basis of sex, decline to accommodate a person who identifies as male but who is a biological female. A different shelter may choose not to make placement decisions or accommodations based on biological sex and there remains no mandate that shelters take biological sex into account.\nAt one point, the document implied that the existing Equal Access rule \u2014 requiring facilities nationwide to provide housing, regardless of incoming residents\u2019 gender identities \u2014 posed a danger to shelter residents; an argument that appeared to be rooted in the unsubstantiated and transphobic claim that men with nefarious intentions might pose as trans women and gain access to female facilities to stalk or harass women. However, the document did not explain how or under what circumstances HUD came to that assumption, nor did it provide verifiable instances of that happening, aside from a pending lawsuit in Fresno, California, that alleges a shelter there allowed such behavior. The HUD proposal stated:\n[The] current rule makes it impracticable for some shelters to, after admitting a biological male, adequately protect the privacy interests of their biological female clientele who do not want to shower, undress, and sleep in the same facilities as biological men.\nPending whatever shelters decide for their entry policies under the proposal, the document stated, staff at facilities that are designed to exclusively serve men or women would ask incoming residents their gender identities before giving them beds. In those cases, if intake workers had \u201cgood faith\u201d to believe someone was presenting as male or female but that gender did not correspond with their birth sex \u2014 which is literally the definition of being transgender \u2014 and that birth sex was not served by the shelter, the staff could turn them away. It was at that point in the docket HUD wrote:\nHUD believes that reasonable considerations [for determining whether a person is transgender] may include, but are not limited to a combination of factors such as height, the presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an Adam\u2019s apple, and other physical characteristics which, when considered together, are indicative of a person\u2019s biological sex.\nIn sum, it is accurate to state that under the leadership of Trump, HUD issued a memo in July 2020 that outlined steps for staff at federally funded homeless shelters to determine whether or not incoming residents were transgender, and given the language \u2014 it listed masculine physical features and how to notice them, presumably in circumstances when trans women are seeking housing at female-only shelters \u2014 we rate this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: The Trump administration issued a memo in July 2020 that listed physical characteristic to look for in order to identify incoming transgender people at federally funded homeless shelters.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In July 2020, social media users began circulating a warning from the Washington State Department of Agriculture about people in the U.S. receiving unsolicited mailings of seeds sent from China (sometimes in packages identifying the contents as jewelry), which included a caution for recipients not to plant any seeds so received and to report them to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as instances of agricultural smuggling:\n\n\nToday we received reports of people receiving seeds in the mail from China that they did not order. The seeds are sent in packages usually stating that the contents are jewelry. Unsolicited seeds could be invasive, introduce diseases to local plants, or be harmful to livestock.\nHere\u2019s what to do if you receive unsolicited seeds from another country: \n1) DO NOT plant them and if they are in sealed packaging don\u2019t open the sealed package. \n2) This is known as agricultural smuggling. Report it to USDA and maintain the seeds and packaging until USDA instructs you what to do with the packages and seeds. They may be needed as evidence.\n\nThis warning corresponded to multiple other governmental alerts and news accounts about persons in the UK and multiple states of the U.S. having received such unsolicited mailings.  The  Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), for example, issued a similar warning to residents of that state:\n\nThe Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) has been notified that several Virginia residents have received unsolicited packages containing seeds that appear to have originated from China. The types of seeds in the packages are unknown at this time and may be invasive plant species. The packages were sent by mail and may have Chinese writing on them.\nPlease do not plant these seeds. VDACS encourages anyone who has received unsolicited seeds in the mail that appears to have Chinese origin to contact the Office of Plant Industry Services (OPIS) at 804.786.3515 or through the ReportAPest@vdacs.virginia.gov email.\nInvasive species wreak havoc on the environment, displace or destroy native plants and insects and severely damage crops. Taking steps to prevent their introduction is the most effective method of reducing both the risk of invasive species infestations and the cost to control and mitigate those infestations.\n\nNewsweek also reported on residents of Utah receiving the same type of unsolicited packages:\n\nA number of Utah residents have been surprised with a peculiar package in their mailboxes \u2014 a parcel filled with seeds and Chinese writing on the outside.\n\u201cI opened them up and they were seeds,\u201d said Utah resident Lori Culley, who found her package with Chinese characters, plus a label stating there were earrings inside. \u201cObviously they\u2019re not jewelry!\u201d she said.\nCulley, who lives in Tooele, thought it may be a case of a mistaken address, but when she posted about it on social media she found \u201cat least 40\u201d local residents had gotten similar packages in the past few weeks.\nThere are regulations as to which plants and seeds can be imported into and sold in Utah. Since the delivery, a representative from the Utah Department of Agriculture picked up Culley\u2019s seeds to have them tested. The department may also get assistance from Customs and Border Protection agents to investigate the mysterious seeds.\n\nLess certain is the purpose behind the mailings.  Explanations from drug smuggling to attempts to trick Americans into planting harmful invasive species have been mooted, although a somewhat different motive has also been suggested: \u201cBetter Business Bureau\u2019s Jane Rupp has another theory. She thinks it could simply be a scam relating to customer reviews, in which companies post low-cost items so they can write fake reviews for their business in a resident\u2019s name.\u201d\nAs U.S. News & World Report explained, the \u201cFake Listing Scam\u201d is employed by disreputable sellers on sites such as Amazon.com, as they attempt to build up false reputations as reliable vendors in order to facilitate luring victims to their scams:\n\n[T]here have been some cases of criminals buying their own products and shipping it to a real address. The con artist then writes a fake review, purportedly from the buyer the product was shipped to. Why does the thief go to the trouble? To make it look like a \u201cverified\u201d review, since the review came from a \u201cbuyer\u201d who bought the product. \n\u201cAmazon is continuously developing algorithms to automatically detect these merchants, but it also relies on consumer awareness,\u201d [Kevin Lancaster, CEO of ID Agent] says. And what really can throw people off is that sometimes these con artists build up a couple months of legitimate sales, making a con artist\u2019s products appear reputable, Lancaster says. \u201cPeople buy from the fake listings, and instead of receiving a product in a few weeks, the scammer has already made off with the money,\u201d he explains.\n\nAt this juncture it appears true that the mysterious mailings of seeds sent with return addresses in China are real, but the specific motive behind them is as yet unknown. Evaluate the following assertion: Residents of various U.S. states have received unsolicited mailings of seeds sent from China with malicious intent. If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

Nancy Pelosi. You know who\u2019s actually empowering that very thing to happen? You know who\u2019s giving Trump the soldiers, the goons, and the money to send those people in there without stopping them? \u2026\nNancy Pelosi is giving Trump\u2019s Homeland Security, who those goons are, all the money they want with no strings attached. She could say, \u2018We\u2019ll fund you, but inside this funding bill you cannot send federal troops into local municipalities, unless you\u2019re invited.\u2019 She\u2019s not doing that \u2014 the Democrats aren\u2019t doing that. \u2026 There\u2019s Nancy Pelosi, one of the most powerful people in government, not doing anything but pretending to be outraged.\nThe claim at its core was multifaceted: that Pelosi made clear in public statements that she opposed the Trump administration\u2019s use of federal agents in American cities including Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Portland in the aftermath of Floyd\u2018s death, and that she was concurrently working on a policy proposal that would cover the cost of similar militarized efforts in the future.\nBelow examines the truth of those assertions based on federal legislative records; Pelosi\u2019s office did not respond to Snopes\u2019 request for comment on the accusations.\nIn an email to Snopes, a representative for Dore said he wanted to expose his viewers to the idea that House Democrats were \u201crefusing to use their majority status to counter Trump,\u201d and that he based his argument on an article by a former speech writer for 2020 presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders named David Sirota. That report alleged:\nIndeed, at times it almost seems as if Democrats are engaging in deliberate performance art to try to dare us to care about this bait and switch \u2014 as if they really cannot believe we are all this ignorant or asleep to not even notice the swindle.\nFirst, let\u2019s provide some context. Trump signed an executive order on June 26, 2020, giving several federal agencies the authority to join the Federal Protective Service \u2014 which is a section of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that aims to protect government properties \u2014 on patrols during demonstrations.\n\nNeither that order, nor other federal records, said how many agents would be participating in the effort, or what department they worked for. However, DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli told reporters tactical units from the DHS\u2019 Customs & Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) were part of the president\u2019s directive. Other reports said officers from a group known as BORTAC \u2014 the CBP equivalent of a SWAT team that normally investigates drug-smuggling crimes \u2014 was also deployed.\nThat said, the DHS was among the leading agencies in the federal government\u2019s response to the protests, making an investigation into that department\u2019s funding proposals the most appropriate avenue to determine the legitimacy of the claim. We reached out to DHS, asking for its response to critics like Dore who believed the DHS should not receive federal funding until it removes its officers from protest sites, but did not hear back as of this writing.\nDavid Lapan, a former spokesman for the DHS and Department of Defense, however, said in a blog post:\nThe creation of DHS [in 2002] was the federal response to the finding, after the 9/11 attacks, that no single agency within the government was responsible for securing the country. \u2026\nWhile the core mission of DHS remains essentially unchanged, its roles and responsibilities have grown in response to various threats including cyber-attacks, election interference, drug smuggling and transnational criminal organizations. None of these threats appear to be present in Portland\u2019s protests. So, at a minimum, whatever DHS is doing in Portland strays wildly from the reason DHS exists in the first place.\nNext, we\u2019ll address the first part of the claim: that Pelosi decried the Trump-led operation, which devolved into federal officers using tear gas and firing less-than-lethal rounds into crowds of people almost nightly in Portland, and an incident in which a federal officer threw an impact munition at a 26-year-old man, fracturing his skull and sending him to the hospital. (That incident was also captured on video.)\u00a0\nWhile individual offices of several Democratic leaders made public statements about the federal use of force against citizens, we are only focusing on comments specifically by Pelosi, since she is the only member of Congress with the legal authority to decide on what legislation the House votes on, and because she was the main target of Dore\u2019s video.\nUpon our analysis of Pelosi\u2019s press announcements, media appearances, and social media posts since Trump made the directive, a series of tweets from her official account on July 17, 2020, appeared to be the first record of the House Speaker\u2019s dissent from the presidential administration\u2019s plan.\n\nThe following day, her office sponsored a news release that said the House was committed to \u201cmoving swiftly to curb these egregious abuses of power\u201d by Trump, without providing specifics, and referred to reports of federal agents in Portland using unmarked vehicles to \u201ckidnap\u201d protesters. (See our investigation into the truth of that claim here).\nThen, five days later, Pelosi endorsed another statement alleging that the \u201canonymous federal law enforcement agents\u201d were silencing \u201cpeaceful protesters with violence,\u201d and made the following comment at a news conference:\u00a0\nThe use of storm troopers under the guise of law and order is a tactic that is not appropriate to our country in any way.\u00a0\nTo recap, it was truthful to say that Pelosi criticized how federal agents responded to American protests in summer 2020, and that at least some of those officers represented DHS.\nNow, we\u2019ll examine the more complicated aspect of the claim: that Pelosi was working under the public\u2019s radar to prepare legislation that would set aside taxpayer dollars to pay to deploy federal law enforcement officers in U.S. cities in line with Trump\u2019s June order. To explore that question, we analyzed the agendas of House committees in July 2020 and looked for proposals that would apply to DHS considering its role in the protests.\nWe learned the House Committee on Appropriations \u2014 to which Pelosi does not belong \u2014 released a more than $50 billion proposal on July 6, 2020, that explained how the committee would like to fund the department in 2021. The annual DHS budget bill was framed by the House committee as a compromise with Trump\u2019s wishes for all offices within the department, which included aggressive funding to continue building a concrete-steel wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. During our read of the draft legislation, we considered the various arms of federal government to which the DHS oversees, in addition to those that had provided law enforcement at protests, such as:\nAmong numerous provisions, the proposal would set aside roughly $14.6 billion for the CBP to hire new officers, among other border-security efforts, and about $7.4 billion for ICE. In total, it would set aside $50.72 billion in discretionary funding \u2014 including roughly the same amount as the country\u2019s 2020 budget for non-military units \u2014 while boosting funding for defense operations by roughly $250 million, disaster relief by $5.1 billion, and military operations overseas by $215 million.\nHowever, nowhere in the roughly 85-page piece of legislation did the committee request federal dollars in 2021 to cover the cost of sending federal agents to U.S. cities to mitigate damage to federal properties during protests.\nOn July 15, 2020, the House committee \u2014 which is comprised of 30 Democrats and 23 Republicans \u2014 amended the legislation so ICE would be unable to use 2021 funding for a public education program, among other changes that essentially added stipulations for how and under what circumstances DHS could use portions of the money. But no amendment pertained to the use of militarized tactics during protests in American cities.\nIn other words \u2014 yes, like Dore somewhat alleges \u2014 House Democrats could in theory include language in the proposal that would only allow the DHS to receive certain funding if it agreed not to participate in the controversial law-enforcement effort.\n\nThe committee approved the budget bill, and it was introduced to the House on July 20, 2020. But as of this writing, it was unclear when or if Pelosi would preside over a hearing in which the full House would consider the proposal, titled H.R. 7669. Also undetermined was if or to what extent representatives would lump the DHS spending plan into a wide-sweeping policy package governing other aspects of federal government \u2014 such as its response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic \u2014 which is typically the process for such budget-making.\nThe House clerk\u2019s online calendar for the week of July 27, 2020, listed the legislation as an item \u201cthat may be considered\u201d on the House floor in the coming days, without any more scheduling details.\nAt least two Democratic representatives, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, asked Pelosi not to schedule the bill for a floor hearing in light of the 2020 protests. They wrote in a statement:\nThe Progressive Caucus has long-standing objections to the DHS Appropriations bill, which would fund [Trump-sponsored] programs and thereby sanction the horrific violations of human rights and due process by ICE, CBP and other agencies. Without the inclusion of additional necessary reforms, we believe that the Democratic Leadership should not attempt to pass Homeland Security funding by tying it to essential coronavirus research, education, and housing funding.\nNow, back to the claim in question. Yes, it was accurate to say members of the House were working on a DHS budget plan in July 2020 \u2014 when Pelosi and other leading Democrats were issuing public statements against the very actions of federal officers who belonged to the department.\nHowever, Pelosi had not voted on or publicly discussed the budget bill as of this report, and given the fact that she did not respond to Snopes\u2019 request for interview, there was no available evidence to prove that she agreed \u2014 or disagreed \u2014 with the proposal. Put another way: It would be false to assert that Pelosi supported the funding proposal, as the claim stated, since it was so far only approved by the House Committee on Appropriations and awaiting a House vote.\nAdditionally, while H.R. 7669, as written, would not explicitly prohibit the use of DHS officers to protect federal properties during demonstrations, it would be misleading to claim the legislation would pump federal dollars toward such law-enforcement efforts directly. The bill, instead, would authorize the DHS to decide how to divvy up some parts of its budget \u2014 which could include funding DHS agencies that were involved in the 2020 protests \u2014 but we have no proof to affirmatively state that the proposal would pay for the controversial policing tactics in the future.\nIn sum, while it was unequivocally true to say Pelosi criticized the actions of federal agents in U.S. cities during protests in 2020, it was false to claim she simultaneously supported a budget bill that contradicted her public stance, and that that legislation would most definitely pay for militarized policing during demonstrations in U.S. cities \u2014 with the caveat that House leaders, including Pelosi, always maintained the authority to determine how and under what circumstances DHS could use federal dollars in the future. Evaluate the following assertion: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi publicly criticized the actions of federal agents in U.S. cities during protests in 2020 \u2014 while simultaneously supporting a budget bill that would fund such law enforcement efforts. If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

With the agitation came rumors and reports across the city of violence from federal agents, protesters being abducted in vans, tear gassing, and more, and the media and our readers continued to pay close attention to events in Portland.\u00a0\nAmong these stories, online video footage showing little children at one particular protest bearing signs that read \u201cFuck the police\u201d and \u201cEff Trump goons\u201d captured the internet and media\u2019s attention, as it was shared by conservative influencers such as Donald Trump Jr. and Andy Ng\u00f4. The video also showed children using curse words to refer to the police. \u00a0Snopes readers asked us if this actually took place.\n\nThe video appears to be genuine. We should note that we have obscured the faces of the children for privacy reasons, but have linked to the original video and photographs below.\u00a0\nWe found what appeared to be the original posted footage of toddlers holding these signs in a July 22 Facebook Live video filmed in a park in front of the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse in downtown Portland. Another sign held in the background by an older person read, \u201cFuck Ted Wheeler,\u201d referring to Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, who has been under fire for his response to security forces\u2019 violence against protesters. A Snopes staff member who resides in Portland confirmed the location of the gathering seen in the footage. Images showing the children from other angles appeared in Facebook posts as well.\u00a0\nFilmmaker Rod Webber confirmed to us that he filmed three toddlers holding these signs on Facebook Live while they were accompanied by adults. His footage appeared to be the same as that shared in Ng\u00f4\u2019s tweet, with Webber\u2019s voice addressing the children. He did not determine who the adults seen in the video were. The text on the signs in the video also showed up backwards because the filmmaker was apparently recording in selfie mode, which causes some cameras doing a Facebook livestream \u2014 depending on how old they are \u2014 to produce a \u201cmirror\u201d effect. Webber said he edited his livestream footage and posted his encounters with the children to Twitter, where it went viral. Below is a screenshot of his footage:\u00a0\n\nThe complete footage showed Webber walking around the park outside the courthouse as people gathered, painted protest signs on the ground, grilled food, and played the drums. At two points, around 12 minutes in, and a minute before the end of the livestream, he encountered the children in the park with the signs.\n\nBefore Webber signed off he walked toward the children saying, \u201cThese kids are the best.\u201d The children held up the signs, waved to the camera, and two of them repeated, \u201cFuck the police\u201d after being encouraged by the adults around them. Someone in the background said, \u201cPower to the people,\u201d as one child raised her fist in what some refer to as a Black power salute, a popular gesture during protests against racial injustice. Webber told Snopes that the adults gave permission: \u201cThe adults in the group saw that I was live streaming, made eye contact and we both went toward each other. Judging by nods, facial expressions and [their] guidance of the children, I interpreted this as consent.\u201d\nSince we confirmed the origins of the footage, the identity of the filmmaker who appeared in the footage himself, saw the children were walking around with adults while holding the signs in a clearly identifiable location, and the incident was reported by the news media, we rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: Video shows young children saying \"Fuck the police\" and holding signs that read \u201cFuck the police\u201d and \u201cEff Trump goons\u201d during protests against police brutality in Portland, Oregon, in July 2020.

The blog post\u2019s key claim was therefore false.\u00a0\nCanada Eh? has a penchant for publishing attention-grabbing and misleading articles about life in Canada.

Specifically, the social media posts stated that the \u201cmoisture and bacteria\u201d found in an anonymous woman\u2019s mask, which she wore daily, resulted in a misdiagnosis of COVID-19.\nMask wearers beware \u2026\nA caller to a radio talk show recently shared that his wife was hospitalized and told she had COVID and only a couple of days left to live. A doctor friend suggested she be tested for legionnaires disease because she wore the same mask every day all day long. Turns out it WAS legionnaires disease from the moisture and bacteria in her mask. She was given antibiotics and within two days was better. WHAT IF these \u201cspikes\u201d in COVID are really something else due to improper mask wearing??\nCopied and pasted\nThe claim in the social media post is false.\nAccording to Legionella, a nonprofit organization that shares educational material and scientific research about the disease, Legionnaires\u2019 is not contagious and cannot be transmitted by infected persons or their masks.\n\u201cYou cannot contract Legionnaires\u2019 disease from wearing face masks. Legionella bacterium is transmitted by aspirating drinking water or breathing in water droplets. Legionella is not spread from person-to-person in respiratory droplets nor does the bacteria survive on dry surfaces. Your mask would not be a source of transmission for the Legionella bacteria,\u201d wrote the organization on its website.\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease is a severe form of lung infection caused by breathing in mist or water that is contaminated with the bacterium. The condition is characterized by a cough, fever, headache, and shortness of breath \u2014 all symptoms that are also associated with COVID-19 and could potentially result in the misdiagnosis. Though Legionnaires\u2019 is treatable with antibiotics, about 1-in-10 infected people will die.\nHowever, as noted by Legionella, if a person were diagnosed with Legionnaires\u2019 disease, it would not be a consequence of wearing a mask. Water contaminated with the bacteria must be directly inhaled or drank by an individual in order to become infected. As such, a mask would theoretically need to come into direct contact with contaminated water in order for it to be inhaled. Even so, Legionella only grows in standing water under warm temperatures and cannot survive on dry surfaces.\u00a0\nIn May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidance for reopening buildings after widespread and abrupt COVID-19 shutdowns of businesses, schools, and other facilities. Those closures resulted in decreased water usage, which could contribute to pooling in water systems that are prime locations for the growth of Legionella bacterium. Combined with shutdown-related declines in water chlorination and regular cleaning, the agency noted that the bacteria may accumulate in standing water over the course of weeks or months before being aerosolized through devices like showers, hot tubs, fountains, and air conditioning cooling towers used once localities reopen.\nSnopes could find no mention of the radio show referenced in the Facebook posts, but we did track down an article published by the Naples Daily News Editorial Board that reported on a rumor of four Floridians who had been diagnosed with mask-related Legionnaires\u2019 disease at a local hospital. The hospital\u2019s CEO Paul Hiltz told Naples Daily News he knew of no such cases.\nA 2017 case study described a 67-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Legionnaires\u2019 disease after failing to clean the mask, tubing, and humidifier of her continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine used for sleep apnea, which suggests that there may be a link between plastic facial masks directly connected to contaminated water systems. However, CPAP masks are generally made of hard plastic with a silicone seal and not the same material as standard cloth filter masks used during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe CDC cautions that people at risk for Legionnaire\u2019s disease, such as those with weakened immune systems and previous smokers, should consult with a doctor before they flush toilets that have not been used recently or perform any sort of cleaning activities that might result in the production of aerosols. In fact, the agency notes that the use of purifying face masks may help to limit the risk of infection.\n\nThe CDC recommends that anyone in healthy respiratory health and over the age of 2 should wear a mask when in public. Masks should be worn over the nose and mouth, held snugly against the sides of your face, and feel secure under your chin. Cloth masks should be washed after each use. Evaluate the following assertion: Legionnaires' disease can be contracted from a face mask used repeatedly.

Joe Morrisey, disgraced former Subway ad spokesman Jared Fogle, and film director Roman Polanski. The cases listed are not connected to each other or to the Epstein case, but instead are a compilation of (mostly) influential men who have been accused and/or convicted of sexual misconduct.\nEpstein was arrested in July 2019 on sex-trafficking charges and committed suicide in jail while awaiting trial. The billionaire financier and previously convicted sex offender was accused of trafficking girls to be victimized by some of the most powerful people in the world. Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s ex-girlfriend, was arrested on related charges in July 2020; prosecutors claim she facilitated Epstein\u2019s sexual abuse of minors.\nBecause Epstein and Maxwell associated with the world\u2019s political and celebrity elite, their activities have been the subject of public fascination and rumor.\nIt\u2019s true that a federal judge made public previously sealed court documents from a defamation lawsuit against Maxwell filed by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre; among the documents were transcripts from a 2016 deposition given by Giuffre.

In 2020, we came across a similar photograph attached to a similar story. This time, however, the picture was real.\nThe above-displayed photograph was taken circa the summer of 2019 and shows a dog named Taka, a Shiba Inu who survived a house fire in Georgia the previous fall. The American Kennel Club (AKC) reported that when the fire broke out, the family was able to get their children out of the house but not 9-year-old Taka. As the fire burned, Taka managed to escape on his own:\nOn Oct. 23, 2018, a fire broke out in Georgia. The family had time to get their kids out, but there was no time to go back in for Taka, their nine-year-old Shiba Inu. The fire burned the entire porch, causing the floor to collapse and Taka to fall through. Taka was able to run to a neighbor\u2019s house. Upon seeing a dog on fire, the neighbors panicked and reached out to Crystal Lesley, a veterinarian at Care More Animal Hospital on Facebook.\n\u201cWhen I saw the picture I immediately called her and told her she needed to bring him to me!\u201d Lesley says. \u201cShe was able to get some help and they brought him in. He was still smoking when they found him. We had never encountered a burn victim as severe as Taka before and we were terrified that he wouldn\u2019t make it.\u201d\nThe road to recovery was reportedly long and painful. Since the Care More Animal Hospital was not equipped to aid the dog, veterinarian Lesley took Taka to a specialist in South Carolina. Taka needed some serious medical attention \u2014 the burns the dog suffered prevented him from blinking and required skin grafts on his face \u2014 so the family decided to sign the dog over to the vet\u2019s care.\nLesley, who saw the dog through months of treatment, would eventually give Taka a new, permanent home. Then, she started to train him as a therapy dog to help burn victims:\nAKC reported:\nIn order to work in the burn unit, Taka would need his Therapy Dog certification. This is what started Lesley on a journey of training Taka. She started working with trainer Mandy Foster, and Taka immediately loved it and was proud of himself.\nThe first step to therapy dog training is the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. The most difficult part of CGC training was teaching Taka to stay. \u201cHe took a little while to do that out in public,\u201d Lesley says. \u201cBut honestly, he has flown right through it. He is so smart!\u201d\nWhile the picture at the top of this article says \u201cTaka is now training\u201d to become a therapy dog for burn victims, this statement is out of date. According to the AKC, Taka obtained his therapy dog certification in July 2019:\nTaka took the CGC test on July 26 and passed. Lesley was beyond happy. \u201cI am so incredibly proud of him,\u201d she says. \u201cJust thinking back to how far he has come and where he is now, is just so emotional.

She said it showed Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies wrongly pointing guns at her 16-year-old son and two of his friends who she says were the victims \u2014 not the perpetrators \u2014 of an assault at a bus stop the day before in Santa Clarita.\nThe footage was viewed more than 275,000 times, and sparked a wave of social media posts denouncing the deputies\u2019 actions in the following days, including a tweet that said: \u00a0\nThe L.A. County Sheriffs are under fire again after point guns at [sic] black teens who actually needed their help following several 911 calls. deputies roll up as several other deputies are already pointing high-powered weapons at the teens, who have their hands up.\nBelow, we lay out an investigation into Collins\u2019 post and the claim that Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies had indeed held three teenagers at gunpoint after witnesses said the teens themselves were attacked by someone at a bus stop.\nWhat Did The Mother\u2019s Video Show?\u00a0\nTo begin, we analyzed Collins\u2019 Instagram video second-by-second. It was unclear whether she recorded the footage herself or if someone shared the footage with her after the incident. The post\u2019s caption read:\nHow will I help my son recover from this.\nI wanted to share what happened to my son yesterday in SCV when he was with a couple of friends sitting at a bus stop headed home. He was attacked by a gentleman (homeless guy) who approached them and first asked them if they had any crack then tried to take their things. The guy became so aggressive that he took his shirt off pulled out a knife and whip them tried to stabbed them. His friends only had their skate boards to cover them from the knife and whip so they held it out to keep distance from this guy. Several bystanders including the restaurant manager of Buffalo Wild wings called the police to get help for the boys but \u201cOne\u201d caller called the police and reported two black guys are attacking a homeless guy. This is how the police responded. \u2026\n\nTo summarize, Collins said the teens were sitting at a bus stop on Aug. 7, 2020, with their skateboards when a man allegedly approached them and asked if they had any crack cocaine. It\u2019s unclear from the Instagram post how the teens responded to the question, but then the man allegedly tried to rob the teenagers, though the post did not provide details about what, exactly, the man tried to steal.\nThen, as the encounter escalated, Collins said the man allegedly lunged at the teens with a knife, and they used their skateboards for protection and to separate themselves from the alleged attacker. Witnesses called 911 \u2014 at least one of whom, according to Collins, erroneously told officers, \u201ctwo Black guys are attacking a homeless guy.\u201d\u00a0\nFrom there, according to the video, two deputies drove to the street, got out of a squad vehicle, and pointed firearms in an off-camera direction. Seconds later, at least one other deputy arrived, and he exited his vehicle with what appeared to be a tactical rifle.\nMeanwhile, bystanders pleaded with deputies to put away the firearms, and the crowd repeatedly yelled, \u201cIt was the other guy!\u201d in reference to the man Collins alleged attacked the teenagers. Additionally, a witness said she told 911 dispatchers, specifically, there was \u201ca crazy man\u201d with a knife chasing three young skateboarders, and that he \u2014 not the trio of teenagers \u2014 was the problem, per the footage\u2019s audio.\nWe should note here: Snopes requested copies of all 911 dispatch audio related to the incident from both the sheriff\u2019s office and attorney Robert Brown, who is representing Collins\u2019 family, and we have not heard back. Under the California Public Records Act, 911 emergency calls must be made public unless specific exemptions apply.\nBy about the 1-minute mark of the Instagram video, the recording had showed three deputies pointing firearms \u2014 the rifle and two pistols \u2014 in the same off-camera direction. Then, the camera panned to show the area at which deputies were pointing: an area by a bus stop where two Black teens and one white teen were standing with their hands up.\nFollowing deputies\u2019 commands, one of the Black teens wearing black shorts and a dark-blue T-shirt at that point dropped to his knees, put his hands behind his head, and allowed a deputy to handcuff him, the footage showed. The deputy escorted that teen in an off-camera direction, while two other deputies continued pointing guns at the bus stop, where the other two teens remained with their arms raised.\nEventually, deputies handcuffed those teens, as well. By about the video\u2019s halfway point, deputies in the camera\u2019s view had seemingly put down their guns.\nOne deputy then told the crowd of bystanders that one 911 caller said \u201csomeone was hit with a skateboard,\u201d and the teenagers were taken into custody because of that report. The remainder of the video recorded the witnesses, including Collins, criticizing the deputies\u2019 actions.\nAfter that, the teens were reportedly held in deputies\u2019 vehicles for about 30 minutes and then released with no charges, Brown told The Los Angeles Times. They are considering filing a lawsuit over the incident but, as of this writing, no complaint had been filed.\n\nHow Did The Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Respond To The Footage?\nNext, we contacted the sheriff\u2019s department to learn under what circumstances deputies were called to the bus stop and to discuss if, or to what extent, the deputies\u2019 actions were appropriate from the agency\u2019s perspective and followed department protocol. Deputy Juanita Navarro-Suarez responded to our inquiry with an email that read:\nA call of an \u201cassault with a deadly weapon \u2013 just occurred\u201d was received by Santa Clarita Sheriff\u2019s Station on Friday, August 7, 2020 at approximately 5 p.m. \u2026\nThe informant stated that two male Black adults in their early 20\u2019s, hit a victim (male adult) with a skateboard.\u00a0 When deputies arrived to the location, they found two males matching the description provided by the caller. The males were detained.\u00a0\nAfter completing their field investigation, and talking to the parties, no arrests were made. Deputies were unable to locate the possible victim.\u00a0\nIn other words, the sheriff\u2019s department said deputies went to the bus stop under the impression that two Black men had whacked another man with a skateboard, and that deputies should try to arrest the skateboard-wielding men \u2014 despite witnesses\u2019 claims in the video that at least one person had, in fact, called 911 because someone had attacked the teenagers. The email made no mention of a knife, though it categorized the 911 call as an \u201cassault with a deadly weapon.\u201d\nSheriff Alex Villanueva acknowledged the popularity of Collins\u2019 footage in a video statement on Aug. 10, 2020, in which he said he had \u201cconcerns\u201d over the deputies\u2019 actions and that the encounter was under investigation, without elaborating further. He said:\nI\u2019ve seen the recent video involving a Santa Clarita incident, which has gone viral, and I have concerns regarding the tactics employed. The call for service was received regarding a felony assault, and the deputies detained those allegedly to be involved. The matter is currently being investigated.\n\nRoughly three hours later, Chief Dennis Kneer of the department\u2019s north patrol division said in a separate video statement that the sheriff launched a review of department policies that govern when, and under what circumstances, deputies should deploy AR-15 rifles, as seen in the video. \u201cWe will thoroughly review our actions related to this incident and take appropriate action as necessary,\u201d Knee said.\nWe reviewed the department\u2019s policy manual, which is available online, and learned existing rules on AR-15s require deputies to attend a two-day, 16-hour training at which they complete \u201clive fire exercises\u201d that are designed to teach \u201cthe basic fundamentals\u201d for using the guns on patrol. The manual stated:\n\nIn sum, considering the email from Navarro-Suarez \u2014 which confirmed deputies were indeed investigating an assault at the time of the controversial incident \u2014 as well as the video footage that showed three deputies pointing guns at teenagers, two of whom were Black, and recorded testimonies from bystanders, we rate this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: While responding to a 911 assault report, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies pointed firearms at teenagers \u2014 two of whom were Black \u2014 after witnesses said the teens themselves were the victims of an attack by a knife-wielding man.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In August 2020, readers asked us to examine the accuracy of claims that before he took office, U.S. President Donald Trump had made donations to a previous election campaign of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., whom presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden named as his vice-presidential running mate.\u00a0\nShortly after Biden named Harris as his running mate on Aug. 11, the president\u2019s reelection campaign denounced her as \u201cphony Kamala,\u201d claiming she was willing to \u201cabandon her own morals, as well as try to bury her record as a prosecutor, in order to appease the anti-police extremists controlling the Democrat party.\u201d\nIn an email sent to supporters, the Trump campaign also labeled Harris \u201ca corrupt former California Attorney General\u201d:\n\nPaul Begala, a former advisor to former President Bill Clinton, alluded to a degree of irony in this allegation, claiming in a tweet that \u201cTrump donated to Kamala Harris when she was [attorney general].\u201d\nIn widely shared tweets, NBC News correspondent Tom Winter claimed that Trump had twice contributed to Harris\u2019 election campaign, in 2011 and 2013, donating a total of $6,000. Winter also said that Trump\u2019s daughter and advisor Ivanka Trump had herself donated $2,000 to Harris\u2019 campaign in 2014:\n\nThose claims were accurate. Records available through the campaign finance database on the website of the California secretary of state show that Trump made two contributions to Harris\u2019 2014 campaign for reelection as California attorney general: a $5,000 donation on Sep. 26, 2011, and a $1,000 donation on Feb. 20, 2013. Harris first took office in January 2011, which means Trump contributed to her reelection when she had already been in office for eight months, and two years, respectively.\u00a0\nIn March 2019, The Sacramento Bee reported that a spokesperson for Harris\u2019 presidential primary campaign had said she \u201cdonated the $6,000 Trump had contributed to a non-profit that advocates for civil and human rights for Central Americans,\u201d with the newspaper adding that Harris\u2019 donation of the money took place in 2015.\u00a0\nWe contacted spokespeople for both Harris and Biden, requesting further details about that claim, including the name of the charity in question, and the date on which Harris purportedly donated $6,000 to the charity. We did not receive a response in time for publication.\nThe campaign finance database also reveals that the future president made several other campaign contributions in California, to both Republicans and Democrats. He donated $2,500 to the unsuccessful 2010 gubernatorial campaign of Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who was ultimately elected to that office in 2019; he gave a total of $3,500 to Democrat Jerry Brown\u2019s successful 2006 bid to become California attorney general; he donated a total of $12,000 to committees supportive of Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger; and gave $25,000 to the state\u2019s Republican party, in 2005.\n\nThe database also corroborates Winter\u2019s claim that in June 2014, Ivanka Trump \u2014 adviser to, and daughter of, the president \u2014 herself made a $2,000 donation to Harris\u2019 successful campaign to be reelected as the state\u2019s attorney general. She also contributed $500 to the unsuccessful 2010 gubernatorial campaign of Newsom:\n Evaluate the following assertion: U.S. President Donald Trump donated $6,000 to Kamala Harris' 2014 campaign for reelection as California attorney general.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: During August 2020, Snopes readers inquired about a Facebook post in which a Florida woman described on video her alarm at discovering the letters \u201cD\u201d and \u201cR\u201d displayed on mail-in ballot envelopes sent to her and her brother, who live at the same address.\nThe video was posted on Facebook by a Palm Beach County resident identified by local media as Tina Brown. It had been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, and it was even retweeted by U.S. President Donald Trump.\nIn the video, which lasted about two minutes, Brown pointed to a series of letters and numbers under the bar code on mail-in ballots sent to her, a registered Republican, and her brother, a registered Democrat, noting that on her envelope the series contains the letter \u201cR,\u201d while her brother\u2019s contains the letter \u201cD.\u201d\n\u201cSo a postal person could see this, if they\u2019re a Democrat, and say, \u2018oh, that\u2019s an R. Let\u2019s toss it, let\u2019s just chuck it,\u201d Brown stated in the video. She then added, \u201cIt is very important that we take these [ballots] and bring it to the voting places, and vote by person. Do not vote by mail. I\u2019m telling you guys, you need to listen to this, OK, please be wary, alright.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the Twitter post that included the video, which was retweeted by Trump:\nMore lies about \\\"Vote by mail\\\".\nThis is nothing but a Democrat attempt to cheat and STEAL this election.\nNothing they say about it will be true.\nMSM reporting on this matter will echo their lies, build upon them, and use every trick they know to mislead you!\nHere's one. pic.twitter.com/ez6IHMvw6d\n\u2014 Don Purser \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@DGPurser) August 16, 2020\n\nThe post likely attracted widespread attention because Trump had been making inaccurate statements casting doubt on the security of voting by mail, a process that would play a big role in the November 2020 general election due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhat was seen in the video \u2014 ballot envelopes with the letters \u201cR\u201d and \u201cD\u201d in their bar codes \u2014 was real. However, the commentary in the video was missing context, thus creating unnecessary anxiety about the labeling.\nAfter the video went viral, Wendy Sartory Link, supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, took to Twitter to explain why the political party-affiliated letters were present on the ballot envelopes.\nThe codes were there, she said, because Florida is one of nine states that holds closed primaries, meaning only people registered as Democrats or Republicans can vote in that state\u2019s primary elections, and the ballots for each party are different. Furthermore, Link added, tampering with mail is a federal crime, and as of this writing, her office hasn\u2019t received any reports of such tampering:\n(1/3) Florida is a \\\"Closed Primary\\\" state meaning voters can only vote for members of their party in the primary election. That is, Republicans can only vote for Republicans that are running against each other and Democrats can only vote for Democrats that are running against\n\u2014 Wendy Sartory Link, PBC Supervisor of Elections (@pbcelections) August 17, 2020\n\n(2/3) each other. Because of this, voters are sent ballots according to their party affiliation. It would be a federal crime for any post office employee to tamper with this process and we have received no such reports of anything like this happening.\n\u2014 Wendy Sartory Link, PBC Supervisor of Elections (@pbcelections) August 17, 2020\n\n(3/3) All ballots for the general election in November will look the same, as voters can vote for whoever they would like. There would be no way to tell the party affiliation of a voter based on their vote-by-mail ballot envelope for the general election.\n\u2014 Wendy Sartory Link, PBC Supervisor of Elections (@pbcelections) August 17, 2020\n\nIt\u2019s true that the letters \u201cR\u201d and \u201cD\u201d are on the outside of mail-in ballot envelopes that Brown and her brother received. However, those labels are only present on primary election ballots when registered Republican and Democratic voters receive different ballots in partisan elections. The labels are not present on general election ballot envelopes.\nFurthermore, the likelihood that ballots would be tampered with by Postal Service workers is highly unlikely. Andrea Avery, a spokesperson for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, pointed out in an email to Snopes that all mail is \u201cprotected by more than 200 federal laws enforced by the United States Postal Inspection Service, one of the nation\u2019s oldest federal law enforcement agencies.\u201d Avery said:\nThe Inspection Service maintains robust mail theft, mail fraud, and security programs that identify, prevent and mitigate issues that could undermine the integrity of election mail. The Inspection Service works closely with the Postal Service as well as our local, state and federal partners, to address customer concerns involving election mail. While election mail is in the hands of our hard-working postal employees, the Inspection Service stands ready to protect it regardless of public health emergencies or natural disasters. To report law enforcement matters relating to election mail, call the Postal Inspectors at 1-877-876-2455\nA statement posted by the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections office noted that voters who cast ballots by mail can track their votes on the office\u2019s website. Evaluate the following assertion: Mail-in ballots reveal the political party of the voter, meaning that Postal Service employees can tamper with election results.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In the summer of 2020, readers sent Snopes multiple inquiries about widely shared social media posts claiming that PepsiCo, the company that makes Pepsi, had donated $100 million to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.\nIn May 2020, a Black man named George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota, prompting a renewed wave of nationwide and international protests against racial injustice and police brutality. The BLM movement spearheaded much of that protest and debate, and in response, critics of the protests targeted BLM, often deploying false, exaggerated, or distorted allegations.\u00a0\nDuring the summer of 2020, those critics sought to target several major U.S. companies, including PepsiCo, by claiming they had each donated substantial amounts to BLM. Social media posts\u00a0in July read that:\nBankofAmerica Gave them $1 BILLION\nPepsiCo \u2013 $400 MILLION\nWalmart \u2013 $100 MILLION\nApple \u2013 $100 MILLION\nComcast \u2013 $100 MILLION\nRight-wing activist Charlie Kirk alluded to an incident in St. Louis, Missouri, in June 2020, in which local residents Mark and Patricia McCloskey pointed firearms at protesters, writing on Twitter:\u00a0\n\u201cIn America if terrorists show up to your home, you get charged for showing that you own a weapon after they tear down your gate. And the thugs who entered on to your property get $400 million from PepsiCo. as a reward.\u201d\nIn August 2020, social media users focused on PepsiCo, and the amount of the company\u2019s purported donation to BLM shifted from $400 million to $100 million, for reasons that are unclear, but may have resulted from a misreading of earlier posts that claimed Walmart, Apple, and Comcast had each donated $100 million to BLM.\u00a0\nA typical version of the post claimed that: \u201cPEPSI JUST GAVE BLM A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS\u2026 PLEASE BOYCOTT PEPSI!\u201d\n\nThe August posts that claimed PepsiCo had given $100 million to BLM appeared to have been based on the earlier claims that the company had donated $400 million. In turn, those earlier posts stemmed from an announcement the company made in June 2020. On June 16, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta wrote:\n\u201cToday, I am announcing the next step in PepsiCo\u2019s journey for racial equality: a more than $400 million set of initiatives over five years to lift up Black communities and increase Black representation at PepsiCo. These initiatives comprise a holistic effort for PepsiCo to walk the talk of a leading corporation and help address the need for systemic change.\u201d\nSpecifically, the company pledged to spend, over the course of five years:\nWe asked PepsiCo whether it, or any charitable entities associated with the company, had donated to groups or projects associated with BLM, including the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, a Delaware-registered entity that is one of the leading formal embodiments of the movement. We also requested a list of any recipients of charitable disbursements from the $400 million investment announced in June. We did not receive a response in time for publication.\nHowever, since $415 million was reserved for supporting Black-owned suppliers, restaurants, and small businesses, as well as starting a fellowship program, it was therefore mathematically impossible for $100 million to have been pledged for BLM.\nThe only component of that spending that appears to leave room for any involvement with BLM is the $6.5 million reserved for \u201ccommunity impact grants to address systemic issues.\u201d So even if that entire portion of funding went to BLM, it would still constitute only a small fraction of the $100 million and $400 million claimed in social media posts in the summer of 2020.\nNone of those who promoted those claims presented any evidence that linked PepsiCo\u2019s pledged investment with specific, named organizations or projects associated with the broader BLM movement or the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.\nThe claim that PepsiCo had donated $100 million (or $400 million) to BLM appeared to be based on a basic misunderstanding of the company\u2019s June 2020 announcement \u2014 or the false assumption that any investment associated with the Black community or rectifying racial injustice must be directly connected to BLM.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: In 2020, PepsiCo gave $100 million to entities or projects associated with the Black Lives Matter movement.

Those sharing this meme claimed that this term stood for either \u201c1 female 1 boy,\u201d or \u201c1 female 1 baby,\u201d and that cars were being tagged with these codes by sex traffickers. The meme received a viral boost when it was posted to actor James Woods\u2019 Twitter account:\n\nThe text read:\u00a0\nA very close friend of mine was out today doing shopping with her child at the Bricktown Walmart. When she left the store a lady stopped her and made her aware of what was written on her back window (1f1b) im just going to assume that it stands for 1 female 1 baby. She was then informed that this is now how sex traffickers are tagging cars.. please please mothers, fathers, grandparents.. aunts & uncles. Be AWARE!\nFeel free to share! Wont be tagging my friend for personal reasons.\nThe claims made in this viral social media post are unfounded.\nPolice in Bricktown, New Jersey, have said that they are unaware of any such activity. But before we get to the police statement about this matter, let\u2019s take a look at the game of telephone that helped this rumor go viral.\u00a0\nThe text of this post states that this happened to a \u201cfriend of mine.\u201d When we read a little further, we see that this \u201cfriend\u201d was warned about this new criminal tactic by a random stranger. Not a police officer, a news reporter, or even a Walmart employee \u2014 just an anonymous \u201clady.\u201d The original post received a few thousand shares, but this post received far wider circulation. And the farther we moved away from the rumor\u2019s origins, the muddier the details got. One poster, for instance, informed people that this incident took place in Bricktown, Oklahoma City, despite the fact that there is no Walmart in this location.\nWhen we try to boil down this rumor to its origins, we see that the claim is based on something someone saw on Facebook, written by a person claiming that their friend had heard from a stranger that the code \u201c1f1b\u201d was being used by sex traffickers to flag future targets. In other words, this rumor doesn\u2019t exactly have credible origins.\u00a0\nThe local Patch website reported:\nBrick Township Sgt. Jim Kelly said the department had not been notified.\n\u201cWe have no reports for anything like this,\u201d Kelly said.\nHe also said the department has not been alerted by state or federal authorities of any information that indicates criminals are marking vehicles \u201cas a method for anything.\u201d It\u2019s simply another Facebook rumor without any facts, Kelly said.\nThis is not the first time that this type of baseless warning has gone viral on social media. In July 2019, for example, we wrote about the false claim that sex traffickers were flagging targets by placing zip ties on houses, mailboxes, or vehicles. In December of that year, a false rumor circulated that sex traffickers were laying down in front of vehicles in order to trick them into stopping. That same month saw the spread of another false rumor holding that roses were being placed on cars to mark potential targets.\u00a0\nHuman trafficking is a real problem in the world, but the schemes described above are not based on any real-world threats. In fact, The Polaris Project, a non-profit that runs the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline, writes that the forced kidnapping aspect of the aforementioned rumors is one of the most prevalent myths when it comes to trafficking:\nMyth: It\u2019s always or usually a violent crime.\nFact: The most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it often involves kidnapping or physically forcing someone into a situation. In reality, most traffickers use psychological means such as, tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims into providing commercial sex or exploitative labor. Evaluate the following assertion: Sex traffickers are tagging vehicles as potential targets with codes such as \"1f1b.\" If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}

After the video went viral, Belafonte\u2019s spokesperson released a statement blaming the singer\u2019s \u201cnap\u201d on a technical glitch. The spokesperson said that Belefonte\u2019s earpiece wasn\u2019t working and that the singer was meditating while the issue was being worked out:\n\u201cAfter weeks of literally hundreds of interviews promoting his HBO documentary, memoir and CD, Mr. Belafonte had an early morning satellite TV tour this past Friday. True to form, there was a technical glitch in the feed to a local station in Bakersfield, CA. His earpiece wasn\u2019t working, so he decided to take the time to mediate before the rest of his Day-O. Mr. Belafonte is 84 years young, but sharper and more awake than most who have been interviewing him. Maybe the world would be a better place if more people took a moment to meditate.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the video from 2011:\nThe clip of Biden comes from the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The manipulated footage appears to show Biden sleeping, but it\u2019s clear in the original footage that Biden was never actually asleep.\u00a0\nThe segment used in the manipulated footage comes from the moment during the DNC in which former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton endorsed Biden for president. In the full video from C-SPAN, Biden can be seen momentarily looking downward, but it doesn\u2019t appear that he ever actually falls asleep.\u00a0\nThe video shared by Scavino loops together a few seconds of footage from this video in which Biden either has his eyes closed or is looking downward and then plays it beneath unrelated audio of a person snoring.\u00a0\nAlthough Scavino did help spread this manipulated footage, he didn\u2019t create it. It appears that this video was created by Twitter user @damonimani. When @damonimani was asked if this video was real on Twitter, he replied that it was \u201ctechnically\u201d real:\n\nWe\u2019re not sure how taking footage of someone who momentarily had their eyes closed, falsely claiming that they were sleeping, placing that footage into unrelated context, creating fake chyrons, adding a snoring sound effect, and then presenting the altered video as if it showed someone \u201ctaking a little nap\u201d during a live TV interview could be considered a genuine reflection of reality, technically speaking.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: On Sept. 2, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump made a statement about the upcoming general election that sowed confusion. Trump urged voters who cast mail-in ballots to also go to polling places and attempt to vote again on Election Day to \u201cmake sure\u201d that their ballot was counted.\nThe president\u2019s comments resulted in not just confusion, but widespread speculation that the President of the United States had just urged voters to commit a crime. Although Trump did suggest that people who vote by mail may need to again vote in person, his stated purpose was to ensure their ballot is counted, not elicit from them a double vote.\nTrump\u2019s statements were both incorrect and potentially harmful to voters, as we will explain below. But first let\u2019s review his exact statement.\nSpeaking while visiting North Carolina, Trump stated the following.\nOn your ballots, if you get the unsolicited ballots, send it in and then go make sure it counted, and then if it doesn\u2019t tabulate, you vote. You just vote. And then if they tabulate it very late, which they shouldn\u2019t be doing, they\u2019ll see you voted and so it won\u2019t count. So, send it in early, and then go and vote. And if it\u2019s not tabulated, you vote, and the vote is gonna count. You can\u2019t let them take your vote away. These people are playing dirty politics. Dirty politics.\nSo if you have an absentee ballot, or as I call it a solicited ballot, you send it in. But I would check it in any event. I would go and follow it and go vote. And everybody here wants to vote. We vote the old fashioned way. You know, we voted in World War I, we voted in World War II, we\u2019re gonna see some great World War II heroes right now. But we voted in World War II. And today they want to give everybody ballots. And every place where they\u2019ve done it, it\u2019s been a mess. It\u2019s been a mess. They don\u2019t know where they are. They don\u2019t know who they\u2019re sending them to, it\u2019s a terrible thing. Follow your ballot and vote. That\u2019s very important, I think everybody understands.\nThe president\u2019s remarks are captured in this video clip:\nAfter making this statement, Trump followed up with tweets that urged voters to do the same thing on a national scale, prompting Twitter to slap the tweets with warning labels indicating that they violated the platform\u2019s election integrity policy.\nVoting by mail will play a significant role in the Nov. 3, 2020, general election due to safety precautions amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Trump has been making comments suggesting mail-in ballots make elections less secure by causing widespread fraud \u2014 doubts that are not grounded in fact.\nThe North Carolina State Board of Elections issued a statement on Sept. 3, 2020, warning voters that voting twice \u201cwith intent to commit a fraud to register or vote at more than one precinct or more than one time\u201d is a felony, and that going to a polling place after already casting a mail-in ballot will only increase risk of COVID-19 transmission.\n\u201cAttempting to vote twice in an election or soliciting someone to do so also is a violation of North Carolina law,\u201d reads the statement issued by Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections.\nBrinson Bell stated that North Carolina has numerous safeguards in place to prevent double voting and urged people to sign up for BallotTrax, set to launch soon, which will allow voters to track their vote through the mail and confirm that it was received by their county\u2019s election officials.\n\u201cThe State Board office strongly discourages people from showing up at the polls on Election Day to check whether their absentee ballot was counted,\u201d Brinson Bell said in the statement. \u201cThat is not necessary, and it would lead to longer lines and the possibility of spreading COVID-19.\u201d\nWe asked the state board of elections about Trump\u2019s distinction between \u201csolicited\u201d and \u201cunsolicited\u201d mail-in ballots and were told that none of the state\u2019s voters are receiving \u201cunsolicited\u201d mail-in ballots.\nWhile some advocacy groups and political parties have sent absentee ballot request forms to voters, North Carolina State Board of Elections spokesman Patrick Gannon told us in an email, \u201cNo one is receiving an absentee by-mail ballot who did not request one through the proper process.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s mention of \u201cunsolicited ballots\u201d is likely a reference to universal mail-in voting, in which states automatically send registered voters mail-in ballots. This system is only in place in nine states and the District of Columbia. North Carolina is not one of them. Evaluate the following assertion: U.S. President Donald Trump told people they should vote twice in the 2020 presidential election.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In the lead-up to the 2020 general election, the internet was rife with political memes criticizing many candidates and campaigns. Among them was a widely shared photograph of U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado, at a September GOP event pictured wearing a T-shirt that read, \u201cKill \u2018em all. Let God sort \u2018em out.\u201d\n\nThe above meme was shared to Facebook in a post by Texas Rural Voices, a group that describes itself as rural Texans and has supported Democratic platforms.\u00a0\nReaders asked Snopes if the photograph of Buck\u2019s shirt was real, and it was. The images were shared by the Colorado GOP\u2019s official Twitter account on Aug. 29, 2020, which we have archived here for reference.\nGreat day in Mesa, Delta, and Montrose counties. People are energized and excited to vote for @realDonaldTrump, @CoryGardner, and @laurenboebert in November! #copolitics pic.twitter.com/jC850BLimd\n\u2014 The Colorado GOP (@cologop) August 30, 2020\n\n\u201cTo be honest, this isn\u2019t really a story or newsworthy,\u201d Joe Jackson, communications director for the Colorado Republican Party, wrote to Snopes in an email. \u201cThe saying on the shirt is well known as being associated with the Marines and Green Berets and the t-shirt was a gift to the Congressman from his son, who is a veteran and went to West Point,\u201d he added. Jackson included links to Twitter posts shared here, here, here and here to support this claim.\nMaj Salinas, branch head of media operations for the U.S. Marine Corps, told Snopes that the phrase was \u201cnever adopted as an official motto or slogan for the U.S. Marine Corps.\u201d Notably, Buck\u2019s T-shirt contains no direct references to the Marine Corps, but it does appear to feature a U.S. Army Special Forces crest insignia.\nThe phrase, \u201cKill \u2019em all. Let God sort \u2019em out,\u201d reportedly comes from the Latin saying, \u201cCaedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius,\u201d which translates to, \u201cKill them. For the Lord knows those that are His own.\u201d The Latin version of the phrase reportedly dates back to the Albigensian Crusade of the 13th century when Pope Innocent III launched a 20-year military campaign against the Cathari, a religious sect deemed heretics, that is described in an article published in the Annals of Burns and Fire Disasters. When the crusaders asked how they might distinguish true Christians from the heretics, a papal legate reportedly replied with the above phrase, according to a collection of writings known as a sourcebook that was published by Fordham University.\nThe U.S. Marine Corps is thought to have unofficially adopted the saying during the Vietnam War. However, Snopes was unable to independently verify whether the phrase is associated with the branch.\nSome social media users argued that Buck\u2019s wearing the shirt was in bad taste after months of clashes around the nation between police forces and protesters of racial injustice. Supporters of Buck countered that his wearing of the shirt showed solitary with U.S. military forces. Buck\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment at the time of publication.\nIt is not clear at what event Buck wore the shirt, but a look at the Colorado GOP event calendar for the month of August 2020 revealed party events held in Delta County on Aug. 3, Montrose County on Aug. 13, and Mesa County on Aug. 21.\u00a0\nThe images were shared once again with Colorado constituents in a Sept. 1 email campaign led on behalf of Ike McCorkle, a Democrat from Colorado who is running for the state\u2019s 4th Congressional District \u2014 Buck\u2019s seat. A spokesperson with the McCorkle campaign confirmed that the photo was taken by a photographer attending a GOP event and that to the best of his staff\u2019s knowledge, the image was authentic.\n\u201cThe image captured of Ken Buck was from a \u2018Guns and BBQ\u2019 rally held in Grand Junction,\u201d said Samuel Banick, the communications director for McCorkle\u2019s campaign.\u00a0\nAs for the other two candidates mentioned in the meme, Lauren Boebert, a Republican candidate for Colorado\u2019s 3rd congressional district, has made several references to QAnon, a fringe theory that has been connected to dozens of congressional candidates. In September, U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, who is also up for reelection, made headlines after he accused public health experts of politicizing the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 Evaluate the following assertion: U.S. Rep.

A 2016 Trump campaign ad featured an image of Russian military ribbons. When the campaign was alerted to the mistake, they replaced the ribbon image with an image supposedly showing Trump touching the face of a wounded veteran. That image, too, was misleading, since the \u201cwounded veteran\u201d in that image was not actually a veteran and did not lose his arms in combat.\nRuslan Pukhov, director of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies in Moscow, told Politico that the planes in this image were Russian MiG-29s. Politico also got in contact with Arthur Zakirov, the creator of the image, who confirmed that the image featured 3D models of the MiG-29. Zakirov went on to say that this image was a composite of several different elements. The mountains in the background, for instance, come from Greece, and the soldiers in the foreground are taken from various armies.\u00a0\nZakirov blamed the Trump campaign\u2019s error on \u201cbad fact-checking\u201d and \u201cinattention\u201d to detail:\n\u201cThis is a completely recreated scene from various photographs of mine \u2026 Everything happened through inattention.\u201d\nWhile the Trump campaign did use Russian planes in an advertisement encouraging United States citizens to \u201csupport our troops,\u201d it should be noted that this image is purposefully generic. It is available via Shutterstock along with the description, \u201cmilitary silhouettes of soldiers and airforce against the backdrop of sunset sky.\u201d\nA lightened version of these soldier silhouettes also carried a rather nondescript description: \u201cfive soldiers of different armies.\u201d Another version of the image shows these planes flying in front of a Syrian flag.\u00a0\nThe Trump campaign is not the only entity to use this generic Shutterstock image to illustrate information about the United States\u2019 military.

Either way, Trump was recognized by the Bay of Pigs Brigade 2506 Association in 2016 as part of the organization\u2019s endorsement for his first presidential campaign. It was the first time that the brigade had formally endorsed a presidential candidate.\n(An important distinction to note: The group that represents the remaining members of the failed 1961 invasion at the Bay of Pigs do not collectively stand for Miami Cubans, or the general Cuban population, as Trump alluded to in his tweet).\nThe controversy began shortly after the president tweeted about the recognition when several media reports claimed that he had mistaken the Bay of Pigs endorsement for an official award.\nThe Bay of Pigs Brigade 2506 veteran group is housed at the Bay of Pigs Museum and library in Miami\u2019s predominantly Cuban neighborhood, Little Havana, and described its association as a group of \u201cfreedom-loving, Cuban patriots from all walks of life.\u201d During the Cold War, U.S. Special Forces recruited and trained members of the Frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD), a group of Cuban exiles that left the island nation when revolutionist Fidel Castro took control of the Cuban government. These soldiers took part in the failed 1961 attack located in Cuba\u2019s Bay of Pigs, which was meant to catalyze an uprising in an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Castro, according to the CIA.\u00a0\nIn 2020, 537 of the original 1,414 Assault Brigade 2506 members remained.\nTrump first visited the Bay of Pigs veterans in 1999 when he was dancing with the idea of a presidential run on the Reform Party of the United States of America (RPUSA), a political party founded by Ross Perot in 1995 self-described as a \u201cmoderate, centrist and populist party that sits in the center of the political spectrum.\u201d During his 1999 visit, the billionaire was presented with a plaque of the shoulder patch worn by soldiers during the invasion, reported The Associated Press at the time.\nCNN reporter Daniel Dale first fact-checked Trump\u2019s claim about the award in September 2020, adding that it was likely his \u201cunprecedented endorsement\u201d from the Bay of Pigs veterans that the president was referencing but that an official Bay of Pigs Award per se does not exist. The president has a history of touting fake awards, including a digitally manipulated Time magazine cover that featured Trump, and multiple false claims that he had won Michigan\u2019s \u201cman of the year\u201d award.\u00a0\nContemporaneous news coverage of the 2016 event focused mainly on the endorsement and mentioned in passing that the group had honored Trump by presenting him with a framed image of the Shield of Brigade 2506. Notably, no one in the veterans group was quoted as describing it as an \u201caward\u201d at the time, nor was it described as such in any media coverage of the event.\u00a0\nTrump War Room, the official Twitter for the Trump campaign, responded to Dale\u2019s tweet by sharing a photo of Trump holding a \u201chand-painted Brigade 2506 shield\u201d while standing next to two unnamed men as evidence that he did, in fact, receive an award.\n\nA news release written by President of the Veterans Association-Brigade 2506 Juan L\u00f3pez de la Cruz on Sept. 13, 2020 \u2014 some four years after the fact \u2014 said Trump had received a \u201crecognition award\u201d from the group in 2016. The statement went on to say the following:\nIt was with great satisfaction that we read President Donald J. Trump\u2019s twitter mentioning the event in which the Veterans Association-Brigade 2506 presented a recognition award, consisting of the emblem used by our patriots during the battle of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Cuba, 1961.\nThe award was presented to President Trump for the purpose of recognizing his political and social platform, which is in line with the conservative beliefs of our organization and his objectives of ending totalitarian regimes, drug and human trafficking and human rights abuses in our hemisphere and beyond.\nWe know what it is to live under socialism and we reject the efforts and the terrorist tactics that the extreme left is using to transform this country, our adopted country, into a socialist state.

It relied on the juxtaposition of two factors: the use, by \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d of a still image from a \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d event in Phoenix, Arizona; and the chyron (or caption) at the bottom of the screen in that moment, which read \u201cBiden Pitches Crucial Latino Voters During Florida Campaign Stop.\u201d\nThe photograph was authentic. It was taken in Phoenix, Arizona, on Sept. 14, 2020, by Associated Press photographer Andrew Harnik with the caption: \u201cSupporters react as President Donald Trump speaks at a Latinos for Trump Coalition roundtable at Arizona Grand Resort & Spa \u2026\u201d\nThe screenshot from \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d was also authentic, and apparently undoctored. It originated in the Sept. 15, 2020, episode of the program, which can be watched in full here. The chyron can be seen throughout the segment in question, which is available to watch, below:\n\u00a0\nDuCharme\u2019s claim was that CBS had, through its use of the chyron, presented the photograph as depicting a Biden event, but that omitted one crucial element of any television news segment \u2014 audio.\nDuring the report, CBS correspondent Ed O\u2019Keefe was, in a voiceover, discussing concerns among Biden supporters that his campaign had not done enough grassroots outreach among Latino voters in Florida, and that the Trump campaign had been doing more. At the moment when the Phoenix \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d photograph shows up on screen, O\u2019Keefe says: \u201cThe president has cut into Biden\u2019s advantage by wooing conservative Latinos \u2026\u201d\nSo \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d actually used the \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d photograph for the exact opposite reason to the one falsely claimed by DuCharme and others: It showed up at a point in the report when O\u2019Keefe was mentioning Trump\u2019s support among Latino supporters \u2014 an entirely appropriate usage of that photograph.\nA considerable degree of irony exists in the fact that the false claim that CBS misrepresented the photograph by taking it from its original context, was itself perpetrated by taking the screenshot from the \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d report, and removing it from its proper context by stripping away the voiceover narration.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s true that the chyron \u201cBiden Pitches Crucial Latino Voters During Florida Campaign Stop\u201d remained present at the bottom of the screen during the moment in question, but it causes no confusion when viewed in its proper context, along with the voiceover. It\u2019s also standard practice for the same chyron to remain present throughout the course of a cable news segment, even if it doesn\u2019t describe or relate to each and every image shown.\nFor example, it could hardly be reasonably claimed that \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d engaged in dishonesty by having the chyron at the bottom of the screen while the following image of Trump showed up, on the basis that the image showed Trump, and not \u201cBiden pitching to Latino voters\u201d:\n\nAfter this fact check was published, Gateway Pundit completely overhauled their article, changing\u00a0the headline to \u201cTrump\u2019s Cut into the Hispanic Vote Leaves Democrats Panicked,\u201d removing DuCharme\u2019s tweet and stripping away any substantive mention of the CBS Evening News segment until the final line in the revised article, which read: \u201cCBS News had to use a photo from a Trump rally because virtually NO ONE was at Joe Biden\u2019s Latino event!\u201d\nDespite the radical edit to the article, and the substantially reduced word count, Gateway Pundit still managed to mislead readers with that claim. CBS News was not forced to use a photo from a Trump rally because a comparable Biden event had been poorly attended, the network used the \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d photograph because, as we have made clear, they were illustrating Trump\u2019s support among Latinos during that portion of the report.

Since he became president that year, Trump claimed numerous times that he was presented with a Man of the Year award by the state of Michigan a few years before he ran.\nWe looked into whether such an award existed, and if Trump actually was a recipient. No journalist or news organization has ever found this to be the case.\nTrump had told versions of this story since first bringing it up at a campaign rally in 2016. In August 2019, at a rally in New Hampshire, he even expressed confusion about receiving the award, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t even understand it myself, but I was named Man of the Year.\u201d On May 20, 2020, in a meeting with Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, Trump repeated the claim, saying:\nMichigan is a great state. I\u2019ve gotten tremendous business to go to Michigan. Michigan is one of the reasons I ran. I was honored in Michigan long before I thought about \u2014 I was honored as the Man of the Year in Michigan at a big event.\nAnd I got up \u2014 and I remember so well. I spoke \u2014 probably just five, six years before I even thought about running for President. And I got up and I spoke and I said, \u201cWhy are you allowing them to steal your car business?\u201d You know, we lost 32 percent of our car business to Mexico, and a lot of it came out of Michigan.\nNot only were multiple news organizations unable to find evidence of Trump winning such an award, but there was no proof the award existed in the first place.\nBack in 2016, The Huffington Post dove into the claim, and found no evidence of such an award existing in Michigan, including from the Michigan Chamber of Commerce. The Detroit News runs an annual list of Michiganians of the Year, but Trump wasn\u2019t on it. We reached out to them and a spokesperson confirmed to us that the winner must be from Michigan. They said:\nThe Detroit News does not award a Man of the Year honor. Our award, Michiganian of the Year, is picked from a selection of outstanding citizens who have helped make living in this state a richer experience for the rest of us, either by their good works or by the example they set [\u2026] President Trump has never been a Michiganian of the Year.\nEven Trump\u2019s Twitter archive did not mention such an award.\nFormer Republican Congressman Dave Trott told CNN in 2019 that Trump\u2019s claim originated from a 2013 event that Trott invited him to. But Trott added that there was no award presented to Trump at that particular dinner.\nThe president has received similar accolades, however.\nTrump was designated as Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year in 2016 and received the Statesman of the Year award from the Republican Party of Sarasota County, Florida.\u00a0\nCNN pointed out that Trump made a version of this claim in May 2020 after falsely stating that Michigan\u2019s secretary of state sent absentee ballots to all voters and had broken the law. (She had, in fact, sent ballot applications).\u00a0\nGiven that multiple news organizations tried and failed to find proof of Michigan\u2019s so-called Man of the Year award in the years since Trump first started making this claim, we rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: U.S. President Donald Trump was honored with a Man of the Year award at an event in Michigan five or six years before he \u201cthought about running\u201d for president.

{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a fake news detection task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepared to take office in December 2016, multiple news reports addressed the potential conflicts of interest he would face as he transitioned from a businessman to chief executive. Many critics urged Trump to divest himself of his businesses and cited former U.S. President Jimmy Carter\u2019s sale of his peanut farm as an exemplary model of how to head off such potential conflicts:\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2020, after an appeals court ruled that a lawsuit could proceed alleging that Trump had violated the constitution by receiving foreign money through his hotels, comparisons between Carter and Trump once again gained traction on social media:\n\nWhile Carter did place his businesses into a blind trust before he was elected president in 1977, he didn\u2019t actually sell his peanut farm until he left office in 1981.\u00a0\nOn Jan. 5, 1977, Carter released a plan detailing how his assets would be handled when he assumed office. Carter listed eight actions that he would take to avoid conflicts of interest, including transferring Carter\u2019s Warehouse, Carter Farms, and all funds related to those business ventures into a trust:\nThe transition group has studied existing laws and regulations bearing on conflicts of interest and the regulation of ethics of officials in the executive branch of government. The existing law is extremely strong in prohibiting outside earned income. Governor Carter heavily approves of that law and its policy \u2026\nIn order to prevent possible financial conflicts of interest while President, Governor Jimmy Carter is taking the following actions:\n1. All common stock is being sold, consisting of 100 shares of Rich\u2019s, Inc. and 956 shares of Advanced Investors. A small net loss on this stock is likely.\n2. Jimmy Carter\u2019s interest in (a) Carter\u2019s Warehouse and Carter Farms, Inc., and any funds related to them (b) all property except the private home and personal items, and (c) his father\u2019s estate will be transferred to a trust. Income or principal from the trust will be available to Jimmy Carter but only as distributions of cash.\nCarter\u2019s business suffered significantly while he served as president, but it wasn\u2019t until he left office in 1981 that the decision was made to sell the family farm:\nWhile he serves as president, Jimmy Carter placed the family farm supply business into the protection of a blind trust before he left for Washington, D.C. in 1977. This trust allowed for a law firm in Atlanta to take full administration of the farm supply business during his years in the White House. The Carters felt that relinquishing the business to someone else\u2019s care would separate them from these affairs and avoid the possibility of their financial holdings resembling any conflict of interest while President Carter was in office. Their personal counsel, Charles Kirbo of the Atlanta law firm, was their financial trustee. Following the election loss in 1981, the Carters were informed by Charles Kirbo that because of three years of drought and several changes in warehouse management, they were over $1 million in debt.\nAs they struggled to recover from the unexpected financial blow, the solution to their problem became evident. The Carters sold the family business and also began writing books, which helped them recover financially.\nIn regards to a meme\u2019s claim that Carter was still building houses at the age of 92, that is, for the most part, true. Carter has been building houses with Habitat for Humanity since 1984. At the age of 92, he was still actively participating in the construction of new homes. The above-displayed meme is a few years old, however, as Carter is 95 years old at the time of this writing in May 2020.\u00a0\nIf the text of this meme was altered to give Carter\u2019s current age, it would still be true. In October 2019, shortly after suffering a fall at his home that required stitches, Carter was back on the construction site. A Habitat for Humanity\u2019s Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project has also been announced in the Dominican Republic for November 2020, but it\u2019s unclear if Carter will travel to the country to take part in the construction:\nSince beginning their work with Habitat for Humanity in 1984, President and Mrs. Carter have helped to build, renovate and repair 4,390 homes in 14 countries alongside more than 104,000 volunteers through their annual work project. Since its founding in 1976, Habitat has served more than 22 million people around the world.\n\u201cWe are honored to host the 2020 Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project in the Dominican Republic,\u201d said Cesarina Fabi\u00e1n, national director of Habitat for Humanity Dominican Republic. \u201cPresident and Mrs. Carter are shining examples of service. We are so grateful to their commitment to building a world where everyone has a safe and decent place to live.\u201d\nIn summary, Carter placed his peanut farm into a blind trust when he took office in 1977. It wasn\u2019t until he left office four years later that the farm was sold. With that in mind, we rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d Evaluate the following assertion: Jimmy Carter sold his peanut farm before taking office as president in 1977. If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}
{"prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a fake news detection task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are only True and False categories, based on your knowledge and the following information: In August 2017, several news outlets reported that public health authorities in the state of Iowa had advised against serving certain alcoholic drinks in copper mugs:Iowa\u2019s Alcoholic Beverages Division did indeed publish an advisory bulletin on 28 July 2017:The bulletin goes on to explain that the Food and Drug Administration food code prohibits food or drink with pH levels of below 6 (that is, relatively acidic food and drinks) coming in contact with copper at a licensed premises like a bar or restaurant.\u00a0The reasoning behind this, according to\u00a0page 485\u00a0of the FDA food code, is that there is a slight but definite risk of poisoning:The FDA code adds that anyone serving beverages (including water) through pipes must also have adequate mechanisms in place to prevent copper from leaching into drinks. It also points out that while copper is an important part of the fermentation required to brew beer, too much copper (above 0.2 mg per liter) kills yeast, so the level of copper leached into successfully-brewed beer falls below what is toxic to humans (about 3.5 mg per liter and above).The 28 July 2017 statement by the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division does not contain new information, new research, or a new warning about drinking from copper mugs. It is effectively a reminder, in light of the recent popularity of the \u00a0Moscow mule, that Iowa has incorporated the federal regulations contained in the FDA food code. That code has contained the same restrictions on copper plumbing and containers, and the same rationale, since at least 1997.It\u2019s clear that although copper is an important naturally occurring trace element, it can also be toxic to humans. It is also clear that toxic levels of copper can leach into food and water through both copper containers (such as those used for acidic drinks like the Moscow mule and other beverages) and through copper or copper alloy plumbing.However, what\u2019s less clear is  copper is enough to make you sick, and how likely it is that you\u2019ll be harmed by drinking a cocktail from a copper mug.\u00a0In 1991, the Environmental Protection Agency established a \u201cmaximum contaminant level goal\u201d for copper of 1.3 mg per liter of fluid (page 130). According to the EPA, the MCLG is \u201cthe maximum level of a contaminant in drinking water at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons would occur, allowing an adequate margin of safety\u201d. A 1999 study in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives concluded that copper levels above 3 mg per liter of drinking water were associated with increased instances of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.The National Research Council\u00a0also lists several case reports and studies of outbreaks and incidences of copper poisoning. The details of these cases are not entirely reliable since they are not controlled experiments, and outcomes could have be affected by many variables.\u00a0The FDA forwarded our query to the Centers for Disease Control, whose spokesperson indicated it would be difficult to give a definitive answer:We also consulted Professor Marc Solioz, a leading microbiologist who has expertise in\u00a0copper toxicity; he told us that there is something of a biological early warning system that can often stop people from consuming copper-contaminated drinks:\u00a0Solioz was skeptical about the potential risk of poisoning and adverse symptoms (discomfort, nausea, vomiting) from the typical consumption of even acidic beverages like the Moscow mule from a copper container:We asked Solioz whether the risk of illness would also be low for a person drinking three to five acidic cocktails from the same copper mug over the course of several hours. He replied:Solioz emphasized that while the risk from typical consumption is probably low for most people, a small proportion of the population (around 1 in 30,000 people) have Wilson disease, which causes an accumulation of copper within the body, and could potentially be harmed by consuming acidic beverages from a copper container.\u00a0While most people are able to effectively secrete copper, Solioz said, those with Wilson disease struggle to do this, so even the relatively low level of copper leached into a drink could make them sick.reportThe cocktail was reconstructed, yielding the equivalent of 179 mg of copper per liter. Wylie concluded:It\u2019s very difficult to conclude anything from this about the rate at which cocktails might typically become contaminated in copper containers: this was a short and decades-old case report, not a scientific study (which could have controlled for various possible causal factors); the author does not make it clear whether he himself was present for the incident; and Wylie also suggests that the level of copper leaching in the cocktail was linked to significant damage to the container. Despite these serious shortcomings, the 1957 report formed the basis of the EPA\u2019s 1991 decision that the \u201cmaximum contaminant level goal\u201d for copper in drinking water should be 1.3 mg per liter. This recommendation remains in place in August 2017.\u00a0We also asked Iowa\u2019s Department of Inspections and Appeals for statistics on reports of copper poisoning in the state, in order to see whether there had been a spike in symptoms accompanying the increased popularity of the Moscow mule, but we were told that the state\u2019s Department of Public Health does not track such reports.Iowa\u2019s Alcoholic Beverages Division, meanwhile, recommends that if bar and restaurant owners are going to use copper mugs for highly-acidic drinks like the Moscow mule, they should use copper mugs lined on the inside with other metals like nickel or stainless steel. Evaluate the following assertion: Drinking cocktails from a copper mug can cause copper poisoning If possible, please also give the reasons. \n\n### Response:.", "chosen": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False.", "rejected": "I don't know."}
