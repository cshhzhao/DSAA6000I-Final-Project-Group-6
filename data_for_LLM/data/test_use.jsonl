It uses some deceptive editing, and it ignores the fact that Romney was pretty consistent in both of the comments to frame his support for an assault-weapons ban in the context of a compromise that also expanded other types of gun rights. The difficulty of analyzing this charge is that Romney's position on an assault-weapons ban in the 2008 debate was so muddled that it's hard to pin down whether he actually flip-flopped. It's more an example of an internal inconsistency than a flip-flop per se. In fact, the DNC might have made a more convincing argument simply by quoting the confilcting parts of Romney\u2019s 2008 debate comment.

Did spending growth cause the shortfalls? The answer is no. All of the budget growth occurred in the non-general fund and were largely the result of actions by the federal government and state universities. All of the shortfalls occurred in the general fund that depends on a separate set of revenues to pay for public education, public safety and health programs.

While the Dems are correct that the percentage of the state\u2019s working age population with a job was the same in June 2011 as it was when McDonnell took office, there is no getting around the fact that the state added 48,200 jobs.

It's possible that Thompson was referring to the Iraq Survey Group, a CIA panel that was formed to investigate whether there were weapons of mass destruction or the intent to produce WMDs in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The report found that Saddam did not produce or possess any weapons of mass destruction for more than a decade before the U.S.-led invasion, but that he \\\"aspired to develop a nuclear capability \u2014 in an incremental fashion, irrespective of international pressure and the resulting economic risks.\\\"", "claim": "The Iraq Study Group reported that (Saddam Hussein) had designs on reviving his nuclear program.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

We found that research has been done generally on the effectiveness of sex offender registration and notification laws. We found that studies indicate the laws have no clear effect on recidivism, or repeat offenses, which is their intended target, and are ineffective in assessing and managing risk.

Figures from the Office of Management and Budget do show 18 laws were signed to increase the debt limit during Reagan\u2019s eight years in office.

Tomei would not be correct, however, based on the intendedness question in the PRAMS survey, which limits results to new moms who gave birth in 2010.

In fact, more than half of the rebates went to the employers that run health plans for their workers.

{"evidence": "In arguing for the repeal of the federal estate tax, Hurt says the levy \\\"in many cases\\\" forces family farmers and small businesses owners to sell their holdings instead of passing them down. He presents no statistics -- or specific examples -- on liquidations under the federal estate tax structure that went into effect in 2011. The estate tax kicks in on individual assets worth at least $5.43 million and joint holdings of $10.86 million. Hurt ignores a body of research showing a tiny portion of deceased people -- only two tenths of 1 percent, according to a Congressional report -- leave estates that are subject to the tax. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates only 6 tenths of 1 percent of estates with farms qualified for the tax in 2013. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that there were 20 small, closely held farms and businesses that were subject to the tax that year.

{"evidence": "Santorum\u2019s ad says a machine-gun wielding Romney is firing mud to hide his own support of \\\"job-killing cap and trade.\\\" While Romney appears to have favored cap and trade in the past, his actions as governor better prove his skepticism of the policy than his support for it. When he could have signed it into law, he declined. And more recently, Romney has repeatedly said he\u2019s opposed to it. UPDATE, Feb. 22, 2012 After we published this story, a reader pointed us to an air pollution plan Romney proposed that was specific to Massachusetts power plants. It was separate from the regional compact that we noted in the original item. The state proposal set emissions limits on power plants and included a \\\"safety valve\\\" feature which allowed the companies to buy emission offsets from environmental programs rather than make the reductions in their own facilities. \\\"You could reduce your emissions or pay into some alternative compliance fund,\\\" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University professor who helped develop the plan. \\\"He (Romney) was looking for mechanisms that would still serve the goals of the program but would limit the financial exposure of the regulated firms.\\\" To Pizer, these carbon limits don\u2019t fit the definition of cap and trade. \\\"Maybe you\u2019d call it the same family, but it\u2019s different because you\u2019re telling each source, \u2018here\u2019s what your limit is, but you can buy reductions from these other programs.\u2019 This idea of trying to limit businesses\u2019 exposure from compliance costs is not a feature of cap and trade.\\\" We also talked to Fred Bayles, a former reporter for the Associated Press and USA Today who covered Romney\u2019s administration. He now teaches at Boston University. In Bayles\u2019 opinion, the Massachusetts pollution regulations \\\"fit the broad definition of cap and trade.\\\" But he added, \\\"it\u2019s in the eye of the beholder.\\\" We think the emission limits Romney put in place might still raise the hackles of Santorum and other critics of cap and trade. But his program lacked the feature most commonly associated with cap and trade -- namely, an allowance for companies that come in below their emission caps to sell credits to other polluters.

However, this clip did not air in 2020 (it\u2019s actually from 2018) and it doesn\u2019t capture Carlson\u2019s full comments about democratic socialism.\u00a0\nThe clip comes from a July 2018 episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight. While the above-displayed clip is genuine, the footage is cut off right before the \u201cbut\u201d Carlson was building to in his remarks and it doesn\u2019t fully encapsulate the Fox News host\u2019s position on democratic socialism. In the full clip, which can be viewed below, Carlson adds: \u201cBut the details matter [\u2026] Has it struck you as interesting that it\u2019s never actually worked anywhere?\u201d\nHere\u2019s the full clip from Fox News. Carlson introduces West around the 2:20 mark:\nA transcript of the relevant portions of this broadcast appears below. The first block quote shows the portion of this conversation that was included in the viral video. The first few lines (italicized) come just before the start of the viral video:\nCARLSON: So, give us some sense of what democratic socialism is. Can you point to an example, and extant example of it, that works? Venezuela seems like an example of democratic socialism? Would you say that it is? And if so, does it work?\nWEST: No, I don\u2019t think that democratic socialism as an ideal has been able to be embodied in a larger social context.\nThere\u2019s different forms of it. Some are bad, some are medium, some are better. But the fundamental commitment is to the dignity of ordinary people and to make sure they can live lives of decency.\nSo, it\u2019s not an -ism, no, brother. It\u2019s about decency. It\u2019s about fairness. It\u2019s about the accountability of the powerful vis-a-vis those who have less power \u2014 at the workplace, women dealing with a household, gays, lesbians, trans, black people, indigenous peoples, immigrants.\nHow do we ensure that they are treated decently and that the powerful don\u2019t in any way manipulate, subjugate and exploit them.\nCARLSON: I mean, if that\u2019s democratic socialism is, then I\u2019m basically on board. I do think that ordinary people, middle-class people ought to have dignity.\nWEST: Absolutely.\nCARLSON: And I think that our current systems make it hard for them to have dignity. So, I agree with all of that.\nThe following transcript shows the conversation that was left out of the viral video:\nCARLSON: But the details matter.\nWEST: That\u2019s precisely why \u2013 that\u2019s why Albert Einstein, Helen Keller, Norman Thomas, Eugene Debs, Martin Luther King Jr., Ella Baker, we can go on and on, they\u2019re all democratic socialists. Michael Harrington, one of the great founders of Democratic Socialism of America \u2014\nCARLSON: I understand. But has it struck you as interesting that it\u2019s never actually worked anywhere. So, the question is not what are our goals. Our goals are the same. How do we get there is the question.\nSo, what happened in Venezuela? They called that democratic socialism, but they don\u2019t have toilet paper, and it\u2019s less equal than ever.\nIn short, Carlson told West that he was \u201con board\u201d with the general goals of democratic socialism, which were defined by West in their exchange as making sure that ordinary people can live lives of decency.

Only 8% of black voters picked Mr. Trump in 2016, and his support among black voters was just 10% in a recent Quinnipiac poll.\nMr. Trump made the case that Democrats are only interested in African-Americans for their votes every four years, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t fight\u201d for the African-American community.

{"evidence": "Amid intensifying debate around the prospect of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment after it was revealed he had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated rumors about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s dealings with that country, Republicans and Trump supporters hit back by attempting to tie several high-profile Democrats and their families to Ukraine.\nRight-leaning websites scrutinized the purported business activities of Paul Pelosi Jr., son of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and attempted to draw a meaningful connection between Ukraine and the Clintons.\nOn Oct. 6, the Twitter account @RealJack posted a widely-shared tweet which claimed that the sons of Biden and Pelosi, as well as those of former Secretary of State John Kerry and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), had worked for \u201cenergy companies doing business in Ukraine\u201d:\nBiden\u2019s son\nPelosi\u2019s son\nRomney\u2019s son\nKerry\u2019s son\nAll are on the board of directors for energy companies doing business in Ukraine\u2026\nCoincidence?\nNo.\n\u2014 Jack Murphy (@RealJack) October 6, 2019\n@RealJack\u2019s claims were further promulgated when multiple Facebook accounts re-posted the wording of his tweet, including the group \u201cTexas for Donald Trump 2020\u201d:\nOn Oct. 8, the right-leaning, Trump-supporting Twitter account @Education4Libs attempted to draw all these strands together with a widely-shared, innuendo-laden tweet claiming that an unspecified conspiracy connected donations to the Clinton Foundation with the alleged business activities of the sons of prominent Democrats: \u201cFrom 1999-2014, Ukraine donated more money to the Clinton Foundation than any other foreign country. Biden, Pelosi, Kerry, & Romney all have children working for Ukrainian gas companies. And all of the people I mentioned want Trump impeached.

So @Education4Libs\u2019 claim that Ukraine as a country \u2014 rather than individual Ukrainian nationals \u2014 had topped the list of donations was not backed up by the Journal\u2019s research.\nHillary Clinton stepped away from her seat on the board of directors of the Clinton Foundation when she became Secretary of State in 2009. According to the foundation\u2019s website, neither she nor Bill nor Chelsea Clinton has ever derived any personal income from their involvement in the charity.\nThe Bidens\nHunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s 49-year-old son, served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a major Ukrainian natural gas producer, from 2014 until April 2019, according to multiple reports. His decision to join the company\u2019s payroll caused some political discomfort at the time, since Burisma\u2019s owner had recently been embroiled in a money-laundering scandal and Biden\u2019s father, the vice president, was heading the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to discourage and crack down on corruption in Ukraine.\nHowever, no evidence has yet emerged suggesting that either Biden engaged in any wrongdoing with regard to Burisma or Ukraine, despite President Trump\u2019s efforts to have both men investigated. It is accurate to say that Hunter Biden worked for and was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, but no evidence indicates any link between his work there and Ukrainian donations to the Clinton Foundation.\nFurthermore, @Education4Libs claimed in October that Biden is \u201cworking for\u201d a Ukrainian gas company, but that\u2019s not correct since he stepped down from his place on the board in April 2019.\nThe Pelosis\nPaul Pelosi Jr., son of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was at one time on the board of a California-based oil-processing company called Viscoil, according to the account he gave in a video recorded in 2010. The link between Viscoil and Ukraine is either tenuous or non-existent and does not appear to involve Pelosi at all.\nViscoil was linked to a somewhat shadowy figure going by the name \u201cAna Shell,\u201d who claims to be an investor and environmental entrepreneur, and claims to have provided funding to both Viscoil and another entity called NRG Lab. The purported Ukraine connection arose from a YouTube video posted by \u201cNRG Lab Research Council\u201d in 2013, whose caption stated \u201cMika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine.\u201d\nThat single line from the caption of an NRG Lab promotional video was cited by Patrick Howley, who writes for The Epoch Times, a website known for promulgating pro-Trump misinformation, in advancing a link between Pelosi and an energy company that \u201cdid business in Ukraine.\u201d However, the claim that Newton, a Ukrainian singer born Oksana Stefanivna Hrytsay, had any connection to NRG Lab or Viscoil, appears to be false.\nWe found a Facebook page labelled \u201cMika_Newton.official\u201d which appears distinctly unofficial, has very little content apart from \u201cAna Shell\u201d promotional imagery, and includes the following description: \u201cHi, my name\u2019s Mika Newton. This is my official page to support projects that NRGLab Singapore makes\u201d:\n\nNeither Newton\u2019s actual official Facebook page nor her Instagram account (where she engages in prolific product promotion) contain any mention of NRG Lab, Viscoil, or \u201cAna Shell.\u201d The link between NRG Lab, Newton, and production rights in Ukraine appears to be bogus.\nIn any event, Pelosi appears to have ended his involvement with Viscoil before the bogus Mika Newton connection was ever made. A spokesperson for Speaker Pelosi told PolitiFact that: \u201cThe company [Viscoil] was based in Southern California and focused solely on U.S. business. The company later reorganized under a different name [NRG Lab], but Paul Pelosi Jr. played no role in the new entity.\u201d\nPelosi Jr. did travel to Ukraine in 2017, but that trip related to his work for the Corporate Governance Initiative and had no discernible link to Viscoil, NRG Lab, or \u201cAna Shell.\u201d\nJohn Kerry\nThis claim is riddled with errors. First off, former Secretary of State and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry doesn\u2019t have a biological son.

{"evidence": "In the first half of 2018, gun violence re-emerged as a major political social issue in the United States amidst a series of high-profile mass shootings, including the 14 February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left seventeen students and staff dead (and a like number wounded).In the wake of a 28 June shooting spree at the offices of the  newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, public attention once again turned to some of the statistics involved in mass shootings and gun violence in the United States.On 2 July, the hyperpartisan left-wing Occupy Democrats Facebook page posted a widely-shared meme that made some striking factual claims about the race and gender dimensions of mass shootings, claiming that of the \u201c154 mass shootings this year \u2026 not one [was] committed by a black man or an illegal alien \u2026 [or] by a woman, either\u201d:The meme didn\u2019t cite any specific sources, but the number of shootings it cited (154) strongly indicated that it was based on data collected by the Gun Violence Archive, a Washington D.C.-based non-profit that tracks and records gun violence. In the aftermath of the  shooting, reports by NBC and  stated that that incident marked the 154th mass shooting of the year so far, and latter attributed that figure to the Gun Violence Archive.Categorizing and measuring gun violence \u2014 especially mass shootings \u2014 is therefore notoriously difficult due to varying definitions and incomplete data collection.No uniformly accepted definition of \u201cmass shooting\u201d exists. Historically, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) defined what they call \u201cactive shooter incidents\u201d as those that result in four or more people (not including the attacker) being shot dead in public through actions not related to terrorism, gang activity, or the commission of other crimes (such as robbery). Since 2013, the FBI has dropped that numerical threshold to incidents involving the deaths of three or more people.Everytown for Gun Control, a pro-gun control non-profit that collects data on shootings, also defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are killed (not including the shooter) but includes shootings taking place in private homes, a circumstance the FBI omits from their methodology. magazine, in their mass shootings database, defines such shootings as \u201cindiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker.\u201dStanford University\u2019s now-defunct Mass Shootings in America project defined a mass shooting as one in which three or more people were shot (but not necessarily killed), excluding the attacker. Stanford\u2019s definition excluded gang-, drug-, or organized crime-related shootings.The Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced project, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot, including the attacker.Of the major sources of data about mass shootings, the Gun Violence Archive has a relatively inclusive definition: \u201cIf four or more people are shot or killed in a single incident, not [including] the shooter, that incident is categorized as a mass shooting based purely on that numerical threshold.\u201d This includes shootings in private places, incidents involving gang activity and armed robbery, shootouts, and non-fatal shootings.These widely varying definitions explain why the Gun Violence Archive charted the number of mass shootings between 1 January and 28 June 2018 at above 150, while Mother Jones, for example, put it at a mere six.We\u2019re going to evaluate the Occupy Democrats meme first on its own terms \u2014 that is, using the apparent source of the claim, the Gun Violence Archive \u2014 and then examine it against some of the other major sources of data we have mentioned above.The meme makes four claims: that 154 mass shootings took place between 1 January and 28 June 2018; that black men didn\u2019t perpetrate any of them; that \u201cillegal aliens\u201d (undocumented immigrants) didn\u2019t perpetrate any of them; and that women didn\u2019t perpetrate any of them. (A spreadsheet containing our analysis can be downloaded here.)We downloaded the Gun Violence Archive\u2019s mass shootings database after the 28 June attack at the  newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, and thoroughly analyzed each incident, using news reports, police statements, and court and prison records to attempt to verify the race, gender, and immigration status of suspected perpetrators in every case. This is what we found.The Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as an occurrence in which four or more people (not including the attacker) are shot in a single incident, and they charted 153 such shootings occurring between 1 January and 28 June 2018. Using their definition and data, we find that:No cases of mass shootings taking place in 2018 through 28 June had yet resulted in any convictions as of 9 July 2018, so definitive identifications of mass shooting perpetrators (along with their race, gender, or immigration status) cannot yet be made. However, it is quite likely that at least some of the suspects so far charged with involvement in mass shootings will eventually be convicted, so it is also quite likely that at least some of the crimes defined by the Gun Violence Archive as mass shootings will prove to have been perpetrated by black men, contrary to the meme\u2019s claim.In fact, the trend is highly likely to be the opposite of that presented by Occupy Democrats, at least as far as the Gun Violence Archive data is concerned. Of the 59 named individuals suspected of involvement in mass shootings, two-thirds (40) were black men. Furthermore, many of the cases in which a suspect hadn\u2019t yet been identified or charged involved gang-related shootings taking place in predominantly black communities, with exclusively black victims.Violent crime, including gun crime, is highly racially linked in the United States. According to Department of Justice research, an estimated 83 percent of violent gun crimes involving black victims between 2012 and 2015 were perpetrated by black assailants. So it would be statistically unlikely that many of the remaining 102 mass shootings involving black victims did not also involve black perpetrators.Although we did not find any evidence that an undocumented immigrant was involved in any mass shooting, it is important to note that police statements, arrest warrants, criminal complaints, and prison records do not routinely specify a suspect\u2019s immigration status in the same way that they routinely specify the gender, race/ethnicity, and physical characteristics of a suspect.We checked multiple news releases published by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) but did not find any instances in which an undocumented immigrant was suspected of or charged with involvement in an attack that would match the Gun Violence Archive\u2019s definition of a mass shooting.In one case, an undocumented immigrant named Arnoldo Pompa-Rascon was charged in relation to a series of three non-fatal shootings on the same day in Kansas City, Missouri. However, that case would not qualify as a mass shooting under the Gun Violence Archive\u2019s definition because it involved fewer than four victims, and the shootings did not take place in \u201cone incident.\u201dSimilarly, the high-profile shooting at YouTube\u2019s San Bruno, California, campus in April 2018 was perpetrated by a woman, Nasim Najafi Aghdam, but because she shot three people (i.e., fewer than four) before taking her own life, this incident was not counted by the Gun Violence Archive.This source defines mass shootings as \u201cindiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker,\u201d and using their definition and data we find:This source defines mass shootings as incidents in which four or more people \u2014 potentially including the attacker \u2014 are shot (but not necessarily killed) in a single spree, and using their definition and data we find:The major difference in definitions between the Gun Violence Archive and the Mass Shooting Tracker is clearly (and tragically) borne out in the widely differing lists of incidents. Both sources have a numerical threshold of four victims, but only the Mass Shooting Tracker includes shooters themselves as victims, resulting in many entries in that source\u2019s database which don\u2019t appear in others.This trend was particularly prevalent among white suspects. Of the 30 white shooting suspects (male and female), more than half (16) took their own lives. All but one of those 16 suicides came after a suspect first killed at least one family member.We found no evidence of an undocumented immigrant\u2019s having been directly involved in any of the incidents recorded by the Mass Shooting Tracker, but it should be again noted again that a suspect\u2019s immigration status is not routinely published in police statements, jail records, or court documents.How a mass shooting is defined has a significant bearing on the statistics we often see on television and read about in the news. Too often, those nuanced distinctions and varying methodologies are not made clear.The Occupy Democrats meme, like much social media commentary on gun violence, does not serve the public well in presenting a full and accurate picture of the facts. The source it relied upon for the figure of 154 mass shootings, the Gun Violence Archive, includes 102 incidents in which the demographic profiles of the suspects are uncertain, so in most cases we can\u2019t glean anything definitive about the race, gender or immigration status of mass shooting perpetrators. Nonetheless, in those cases where suspects were identified, two-thirds of them were black men, a fact that significantly undermines the credibility of the meme.When we widen the definition to include shooters themselves as victims (as the Mass Shooting Tracker does), we observe a pattern of murder-suicides and family annihilations not represented in other sources \u2014 one which includes five female suspects (and little doubt among investigators about their culpability). And once again, black men represented a majority (58) of the 97 named suspects in the cases listed by the Mass Shooting Tracker. These two facts also significantly undermine the credibility of the Occupy Democrats meme.\u00a0When we consulted the  database, a source that strips away non-fatal, non-public, and gang-related mass shootings, we are left with only six incidents between 1 January and 28 June 2018. In five of those, the suspect was a white man, and in the remaining case the suspect was an Asian-American man. The absence of black, immigrant and female perpetrators from this list speaks in favor of the meme, but the total number of incidents (six) means it has little relevance to the 154 mass shootings mentioned by Occupy Democrats.", "claim": "Of the 154 mass shootings recorded in the U.S. in 2018 through 28 June, none of them were perpetrated by black men, undocumented immigrants, or women.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

{"evidence": "The use of child labor in cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where nearly 60% of the world\u2019s cobalt is currently produced, is certainly a major issue that deserves the attention of consumers, corporations, and governments. However, some media outlets and social media users have distorted the issue into a rallying cry against the use of electric cars and clean energy.\nIn February 2017, an investigation by Sky News revealed that children as young as 4 years old were working in horrid conditions in cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC):\nWhile the news outlet reported that cobalt was an \u201cessential part of most mobile gadgets sold around the world,\u201d the Daily Mail seized on another use of cobalt, the manufacturing of electric car batteries, when it repackaged the Sky News report in an August 2017 article entitled: \u201cChild miners aged four living a hell on Earth so YOU can drive an electric car: Awful human cost in squalid Congo cobalt mine that Michael Gove didn\u2019t consider in his \u2018clean\u2019 energy crusade.\u201d\nThe headline of the Daily Mail article may have left some readers with the impression that cobalt is used solely in the manufacturing of electric car batteries. This chemical, however, is also used to manufacture rechargeable batteries in cellphones, laptops, tablets, and other electronics. The Cobalt Institute reports that about 42% of all cobalt produced globally can be found in these rechargeable batteries. A quarter of that, according to a February 2018 article on Phys.org, is used for electric car batteries. In other words, only about 10% of all cobalt produced globally is used in electric car batteries.\nThe remaining 58% of the cobalt produced globally is used in industrial and military applications (super alloys, catalysts, magnets, and pigments, among others).\u00a0\nThe Daily Mail article also stated that \u201calmost every big motor manufacturer striving to produce millions of electric vehicles buys its cobalt from the impoverished central African state,\u201d but that is also misleading, because many electric car manufacturers have committed to procuring their cobalt from ethical sources. BMW, for instance, recently stated that it will purchase all of its cobalt from Australia and Morocco to ensure that child labor isn\u2019t used in the mining of this material.\u00a0\nBMW also insists on transparency in every step of the supply chain in order to ensure that the cobalt it procures comes from an ethical source:\nThe BMW Group currently only obtains cobalt directly through the purchase of battery cells. However, taking all stages of the value chain into account is an integral part of the company\u2019s corporate strategy. For this reason, the BMW Group also examines the origin of this raw material very closely and critically. This applies above all to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, from where two thirds of the quantities required worldwide originate.\n\u201cWe are working intensively on measures to ensure that our suppliers and their supply chain also consistently comply with the social and environmental standards we expect. This is currently only guaranteed in large-scale industrial mining. However, around 20 percent of cobalt produced in the Congo originates from artisanal mines where workers mine cobalt on a small scale using simple tools,\u201d says Claudia Becker, expert for sustainable purchasing at the BMW Group.\nIn order to prevent cobalt mined under adverse social and ecological conditions from being used by the BMW Group for batteries in the BMW i3 or the BMW i8 for example, the company demands absolute transparency \u2013 above all from every stage of the cobalt supply chain: \u201cWe only accept companies that extract cobalt from mines where employees are protected,\u201d emphasizes Becker. Moreover, BMW regularly publishes information on cobalt smelters and the raw material\u2019s countries of origin.\nTesla has also been working to both reduce the amount of cobalt needed to manufacture its batteries and to procure cobalt from more ethical sources. Since 2012, Tesla has reduced the amount of cobalt in its batteries from 60% to just 3%. Company Founder Elon Musk has also stated that he is hoping to eliminate cobalt altogether in the company\u2019s next generation of batteries. Tesla has also committed to sourcing its cobalt from more ethical sources in North America.\nSome industry experts, however, have expressed doubts that Tesla will be able to achieve these goals. Caspar Rawles, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence who focuses on the cobalt market, told The Verge in June 2018:\nA lot of companies, including Tesla, are interested in making the zero-cobalt battery. When do you think that will happen?\nTesla uses a formulation called NCA (nickel, cobalt, aluminum) that is already very low-cobalt. Over the last six years, Tesla and Panasonic [which supplies batteries to Tesla] have reduced cobalt dependency by about 60 percent already. That\u2019s already very low. We think it\u2019s going to be difficult for them to go much lower because you run into engineering problems.\nIn sum, it\u2019s true that the majority of the world\u2019s cobalt supply comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where numerous reports of child-labor and human-rights abuses have been uncovered. It\u2019s also true that cobalt is a chemical element that is used in electric car batteries. However, it\u2019s misleading to claim that these children are \u201cliving a hell on Earth so YOU can drive an electric car,\u201d because the majority of cobalt is not used for electric car batteries, and electric car manufacturers, such as Tesla and BMW, procure their cobalt from sources outside of the DRC.\u00a0", "claim": "Electric car manufacturers rely on child labor to extract cobalt for their car batteries.

{"evidence": "In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that they would be canceling a contract with a company called Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc. (ABR) to procure fetal tissue for federal medical research projects. The department alleged that they were not \u201csufficiently assured that the contract included the appropriate protections applicable to fetal tissue research or met all other procurement requirements.\u201dUsing this development as pretext, HHS announced that they would additionally be conducting \u201ca comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue to ensure consistency with statutes and regulations governing such research, and to ensure the adequacy of procedures and oversight of this research in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved\u201d \u2014 in effect putting a \u201cpause\u201d on all research that relied on fetal tissue.ABR supplied fetal tissue to two National Institutes of Health [NIH] laboratories, one of which uses the material to create what are known as humanized mice. In a broad sense, these mice have been bred, with the help of fetal human tissue, to express a human immune response, making them a cost-effective way to test the efficacy of immunotherapeutic drugs:ABR had been the supplier of fetal tissue to NIH\u2019s Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Montana, which had been using humanized mice to test potential HIV therapies. In a grant report on that laboratory\u2019s efforts to study HIV using humanized-mouse models during the 2016 fiscal year, NIH scientist Kim Hasenkrug indicated strong potential for their research methods to aid in the search for new treatments for HIV:Warner Greene, the director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research in San Francisco, had been collaborating with RML to test potential antibody therapies on humanized mice, and he first told  that the HHS \u201cpause\u201d on fetal tissue procurement meant that the researchers could not guarantee enough mice to complete a statistically robust study. In a phone call, he explained to us that:Speaking to  Greene said that \u201cHasenkrug had not yet launched the experiment, and [RML\u2019s] supplies of existing mice were too small to conduct the repeated experiments required to reach convincing scientific conclusions.\u201d In a 9 December 2018 statement provided to  after the publication\u2019s original 7 December 2018 reporting, HHS acknowledged that they had (at least temporarily) blocked staff scientists from procuring fetal tissue, but that they did not think \u2014 or realize \u2014 such a move would have affected the study in question:In his interview with us, Greene stated that this explanation made no sense. \u201cTo my knowledge \u2026 we were never made aware that we should approach the NIH to inform them of our need for more fetal tissue to complete this investigation.\u201d If such a request were required, Greene said, he and his team would have \u201cacted upon it in a millisecond.\u201d We also reached out to the director of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which oversees the Rocky Mountain Laboratory) for an update on the current status of the project and for clarification on the fetal tissue review\u2019s impact on the study but have not received a response.However, as HHS has acknowledged both that they \u201cput a pause in place\u201d on fetal tissue procurement, and that this pause resulted in the inability of a trial seeking an HIV cure to move forward, it is factual to state that the Trump administration\u2019s policies shut down (at least temporarily) scientists\u2019 efforts to find a cure for HIV. Greene told us that NIH has been extremely supportive of their work, and that he feels that this change is \u201cclearly a policy that\u2019s \u2026 reflective of a new political situation in Washington, D.C., that\u2019s now impacting our science.\u201dGreene is one of many who viewed the 24 September announcement regarding fetal tissue research as a proxy debate over abortion. Chronologically, the announcement that the federal government would cut ties with ABR followed a campaign by several anti-abortion groups who explicitly sought to have the government cancel its contract with ABR, as reported in :Greene told us that after much internal debate, he and Hasenkrug plan on running that initial experiment anyway, with the hopes that the political climate will change in their favor come January 2019.", "claim": "The Trump Administration\u2019s policies have halted a research effort seeking a cure for HIV.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}
{"evidence": "On Aug. 25, 2020 \u2014 one day after a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was captured on cell phone video shooting Jacob Blake, a Black man, multiple times as he was trying to enter his vehicle \u2014 social media users shared a video of what they said showed the aftermath of protests decrying the shooting.\nThe footage showed smoke rising from, the posts alleged, a facility run by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC) in Kenosha. Racial justice activist Shaun King, for example, shared the clip on Facebook with the caption: \u201cIn Kenosha, protestors burned down the ENTIRE Department of Corrections compound. And spray painted the question \u2018Are you listening yet?\u2019 on what remains.\u201d\nThe Wisconsin Department of Corrections building was set on fire during the second night of unrest in Kenosha.

This video was recorded before bulldozers were brought in. @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/x0voJ2xF4I\n\u2014 Vi Nguyen (@ViNguyen) August 25, 2020\n\nTo unpack the legitimacy of the claim, we considered it two-pronged: a facility run by the DOC in Kenosha was set on fire during the August 2020 protests against racism in policing, and the flames and smoke damage completely \u2014 not partially \u2014 destroyed the building.\nFirst, we considered the addresses of properties run by the DOC in Kenosha, specifically an office for processing paroles and probations, called the Community Corrections Division, at 1212 60th St., and the Kenosha Correctional Center, which is a prison that can house up to 115 male inmates, at 6353 14th Ave.\nA photograph taken by Ashlee Rezin Garcia, a Chicago Sun-Times photojournalist, showed a Kenosha building ablaze and confirmed it was the probation and parole office, not the prison, that was along the route of the protests on Aug. 24.\nNext, we considered Google Maps footage, which was captured in July 2012, to determine if the site depicted in the viral video was indeed the property on 60th Street. Several architectural elements such as the property\u2019s landscaping and building design seen on Google Maps\u2019 street view matched what was shown in the clip, eliminating any speculation that the video erroneously showed rubble and damage from a site that was not a DOC-operated facility in Kenosha.\nSo to recap, it was true to claim a DOC-run office in Kenosha was set on fire during the protests, and the viral video indeed depicted the aftermath of that site\u2019s damage.\nAfter that, we sought any evidence to confirm or deny that the fire destroyed the entire building.\nSnopes presented the question to the DOC\u2019S Office of Public Affairs, and Deputy Director of Communications Anna Neal responded to our inquiry with an email, which explained staff had indeed used the building to meet with people on probation, parole, or other types of court-mandated supervision. But since the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, she wrote, most staff had been working remotely, not in the office. Neal added:\nThe building was burned down and unfortunately was a total loss, however we are happy to note there was no one in the building at the time of the incident and there are no staff injuries reported. [\u2026] All essential operations are still being conducted, and public safety remains our number one priority.\nIn sum, considering the accurate documentation of the fire and its aftermath, as well as confirmation from a DOC spokesperson that the building sustained irreparable fire damage, we rate this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d", "claim": "During protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a Kenosha facility run by the state Department of Corrections was set on fire and completely destroyed.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}

It is part of a longer piece of text shared to his personal Facebook page on the night of the shooting. The entire statement can be viewed below or here on Wiles\u2019 Facebook page. We\u2019ve highlighted the portion of this message that went viral on social media:\nToday, El Paso families went to the store to shop as they have done many times in the past, but this time 20 El Pasoans never made it home and many others are fighting for their lives.\nFirst of all, I want to say that I have never been more proud of the El Paso Police Department than I am today. Their response to this dangerous and chaotic situation, as well as the arrest of the individual responsible, was nothing short of heroic. I would also be remiss if I did not mention all the other agencies (to include the El Paso County Sheriffs Office) that assisted and had the same heroic intentions as they searched for this armed subject, placing themselves in potential danger. Law enforcement in El Paso showed the entire nation what we are willing to do to protect our community.\nBut, like the rest of you, I am sad and hurt at the loss of innocent lives and the struggle their families are going through and will go through for years to come. Those who are injured and their families and how they are holding on to a hope that everything will be okay even though they will never be the same again. We are talking about innocent men, women and children.\nSo your first question may be why? Why in this great diverse city would someone come in from the outside to take the lives of our brothers and sisters.\nI love El Paso and it\u2019s diversity and believe that being raised here made me and my children who we are today. And I thank God for that.\nBut what happened today is beyond comprehension. This Anglo man came here to kill Hispanics. I\u2019m outraged and you should be too. This entire nation should be outraged. In this day and age, with all the serious issues we face, we are still confronted with people who will kill another for the sole reason of the color of their skin.\nI fear things will not get better. Not pointing out anyone in particular, but I\u2019m sick of people jumping in front of the cameras offering prayers and condolences as things just keep getting worse.\nIt\u2019s time to rise up and hold our representatives accountable at all levels. I want representatives who will stand up against racism. Who will stand up and support the diversity of our nation and our state. Who will stand up for a strong criminal justice system that holds criminals responsible and keeps violent individuals locked up and off our streets. Who support robust community mental health services. Who support keeping guns out of the hands of people who are just waiting for an opportunity to kill others.\nEl Paso will never be the same, because a racist came to our city to try and make a point. It didn\u2019t work though, because the backlash of this community, as we hold national, state and local politicians accountable, will be the only point that will be made.\nTo be clear, Wiles posted this message to his personal Facebook page \u2014 the El Paso County sheriff did not release this statement via the department\u2019s official social media channels.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to the El Paso Times, Wiles has been the El Paso County sheriff since 2009.

{"evidence": "One of the many political controversies surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 was U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated touting of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine for treatment of the coronavirus disease, despite a lack of scientific studies and evidence demonstrating its effectiveness for that purpose.\nOne item that circulated on social media played on that controversy by purporting to show two seemingly contradictory CNN articles about hydroxychloroquine, published three months apart and co-authored by the same person. One criticized Trump for being \u201cwrong\u201d about hydroxychloroquine, and the other acknowledged that a study had found hydroxychloroquine helpful in treating coronavirus patients:\n\nHowever, these articles were not contradictory in content, and they were presented in a misleading manner in the above example to make them seem so.\nThe first article, published on April 11, 2020, and written by Elizabeth Cohen and Dr. Minali Nigam, was headlined \u201cPresident Trump is wrong in so many ways about hydroxychloroquine studies. Here are the facts.\u201d This article did not assert that hydroxychloroquine had no value whatsoever as a treatment for the coronavirus disease. Rather, it pointed out four specific ways in which Trump had made claims about hydroxychloroquine studies that were contrary to what doctors were expressing about the subject at the time:\n1) How soon until we know if hydroxychloroquine works against coronavirus? Trump says \u201cdays.\u201d Doctors say weeks or months.\n2) French researchers have already done a clinical study showing hydroxychloroquine works as a treatment for coronavirus. Doesn\u2019t that tell us something? Trump says yes. Doctors say the study was terrible, so no.\n3) Have some people tried to delay hydroxychloroquine clinical trials? Trump says yes, and he came to the rescue. Doctors say they have no idea what he\u2019s talking about.\n4) Is hydroxychloroquine safe for coronavirus patients? Trump says yes. Doctors say the drug can have serious side effects.\nThe second article, published on July 3 2020, and written by Maggie Fox, Andrea Kane, and Elizabeth Cohen, had its headline deceptively truncated in the above example to remove the skepticism it expressed about a recent hydroxychloroquine study. The full headline read \u201cStudy finds hydroxychloroquine may have boosted survival, but other researchers have doubts,\u201d and the text of the article detailed the dispute over the study\u2019s findings:\nA surprising new study found the controversial antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine helped patients better survive in the hospital. But the findings, like the federal government\u2019s use of the drug itself, were disputed.\nA team at Henry Ford Health System in southeast Michigan said their study of 2,541 hospitalized patients found that those given hydroxychloroquine were much less likely to die.\nt\u2019s a surprising finding because several other studies have found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine, a drug originally developed to treat and prevent malaria. President Donald Trump touted the drug heavily, but later studies found not only did patients not do better if they got the drug, they were more likely to suffer cardiac side effects.\nResearchers not involved in the Henry Ford study pointed out it wasn\u2019t of the same quality of the studies showing hydroxychloroquine did not help patients, and said other treatments, such as the use of the steroid dexamethasone, might have accounted for the better survival of some patients \u2026 They noted that the Henry Ford team did not randomly treat patients but selected them for various treatments based on certain criteria.\n[Eli Rosenberg, associate professor of epidemiology at the University at Albany School of Public Health] also pointed out that the Detroit paper excluded 267 patients \u2014 nearly 10% of the study population \u2014 who had not yet been discharged from the hospital.\nHe said this might have skewed the results to make hydroxychloroquine look better than it really was. Those patients might have still been in the hospital because they were very sick, and if they died, excluding them from the study made hydroxychloroquine look like more of a lifesaver than it really was.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of loosey-goosiness here in all this,\u201d he told CNN.\nOther analyst likewise found the hydroxychloroquine study referenced by CNN to be dubious, for similar reasons:\nThe study that sparked the latest controversy was anything but randomized. Not only was it not randomized, outside experts noted, but patients who received hydroxychloroquine were also more likely to get steroids, which appear to help very sick patients with Covid-19. That is likely to have influenced the central finding of the Henry Ford study: that death rates were 50% lower among patients in hospitals treated with hydroxychloroquine.\nEvidence that hydroxychloroquine does not help hospitalized patients \u2014 the use in its original emergency use authorization, which was designed to allow doctors to access a national stockpile of the drug \u2014 is mounting.\nSaid [Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic and a longtime clinical trialist]: \u201cThe sooner we stop talking about hydroxychloroquine, the sooner we can focus attention on more promising therapies.\u201d\nIn short, information about hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, published by CNN in two articles in April and July of 2020, was neither contradictory nor inaccurate \u2014 despite deceptive attempts to make it look that way.", "claim": "A graphic shows contradictory CNN articles about hydroxychloroquine, published three months apart and co-authored by the same person.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "As the 4th of July approached in 2018, some social media users were surprised to learn about the existence of \u201csilent fireworks\u201d when they came across an article published by the web site \u201cDogTime\u201d a few years prior about a town in Italy which had supposedly switched to these seemingly noiseless pyrotechnic displays:The phrase \u201csilent fireworks,\u201d however, is a bit misleading.Many readers seemed to come away with the impression that these \u201csilent fireworks\u201d would appear just as big and bright as traditional fireworks, but without the loud explosive booms normally associated with them. That\u2019s not the case, however: No matter how advanced pyrotechnicians may be at developing fireworks, they haven\u2019t quite yet figured out a way to remove noise from these large explosions.In fact, these \u201csilent firework\u201d displays (which are probably better described as \u201creduced noise\u201d displays) don\u2019t typically include the big aerial explosions found in traditional fireworks shows. Rather than employing some new form of pyrotechnology that dampens the noise of traditional fireworks, such \u201cquiet\u201d displays mostly make selective use of existing non-loud forms of fireworks:As such, these types of displays are generally more appropriate for smaller crowds rather than for large, city-wide celebrations:Although many readers may have only recently learned about the concept of \u201csilent fireworks,\u201d most of them have probably already seen forms of these relatively noiseless displays, such as roman candles and sparklers.Here\u2019s a video of the \u201cflying fish\u201d firework referenced above:Thus, reports about \u201csilent fireworks\u201d are less about the development of new noiseless products and more about how some towns are focusing on putting on quieter displays. These shows range from nearly silent displays featuring large sparklers, fountains, and roman candles, to aerial shows that employ most everything other than the massively loud aerial \u201cskyrocket\u201d shells.Paul Singh, the director of Epic Fireworks in England, said that his quiet firework displays are typically softer than the accompanying music and are well below the 120 decibel limit placed on fireworks sold in the UK:A 2012 video from Gala Fireworks shows just how quiet (or loud) these \u201csilent firework\u201d displays can be. This footage was taken during a wedding at Browsholme Hall in England, and the company explained that they used \u201clow-noise\u201d fireworks because the venue was surrounded by farm land and they didn\u2019t want to scare the livestock:Although companies may bill these displays as \u201csilent\u201d or \u201cquiet,\u201d the fireworks can still generate a good bit of noise. In fact, when the\u00a0Birmingham Botanical Gardens advertised a quieter fireworks show in 2015, a number of parents still complained that the \u201csilent\u201d explosions were far too loud:So, the term \u201csilent fireworks\u201d does not refer to a new form of firework that produces huge explosions with little or no noise, but rather to shows that selectively utilize existing forms of relatively quiet fireworks.", "claim": "Several cities have started to use \"silent fireworks\" in order to make the shows more enjoyable for children, pets, and people with PTSD.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

That was until people sent me multiple screen shots of the same Twitter violation sent to them over having a Jewish Star of David in their profile pictures and [said] that this has happened before.\nWe are unsure if anti-Zionists are reporting these profile pictures to twitter, or if twitter is finding them by itself. Either way, someone on the twitter team is deeming the Star of David hateful imagery and forcing users to take their pictures down if they want to continue to use their platforms.\nTwitter explained via their Public Policy account that they had not intended to interfere with all depictions of the Star of David \u2014 specifically only those reminiscent of the yellow stars and badges used to identify Jews in Nazi Germany, symbols which are often employed in the modern era by anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi groups in a manner that violates Twitter\u2019s Hateful Conduct Policy:\nWe want to clarify some questions about hateful imagery on Twitter.

We have determined that this account violated the Twitter Rules. Specifically for: Violating our rules against posting hateful imagery. You may not use hateful images or symbols in your profile image or profile header. As a result, we have locked your account.\u201d\nThe social media platform advises users that if they delete the \u201chateful imagery\u201d, i.e. the Star of David, the account may be unlocked.\nThe Stars of David in the profile pictures of locked accounts vary from artistic blue Stars of David and graffitied white Stars of David to, most ironically, a portfolio of yellow Stars of David.\nArutz Sheva and others also stated that Twitter appeared to be taking action against accounts displaying the Star of David in ways that did not constitute \u201chateful conduct\u201d:\nThe only time twitter mentions in its rules that A Star of David is considered hateful is [in] \u201cimages altered to include hateful symbols or references to a mass murder that targeted a protected category, e.g., manipulating images of individuals to include yellow Star of David badges, in reference to the Holocaust.\u201d None of the users that were considered \u201cin violation\u201d of their rules had such a star. There\u2019s also a fine print in the twitter rules that allows exceptions if it is for educational purposes.

{"evidence": "In April 2020, millions of Americans who lost income due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic were waiting on promised relief payments from the United States government. So when news broke that U.S. President Donald Trump was making the \u201cunprecedented\u201d move of having his name added to these stimulus checks, a decision that could potentially delay the arrival of these checks by several days, many citizens took to social media to voice their displeasure, as in the example below:\n\nTrump\u2019s name is truly being added to the COVID-19 stimulus checks, otherwise known as Economic Impact Payments. As of this writing, however, officials at the U.S. Treasury Department insist this will not result in any delays.\u00a0\nThe Washington Post first reported on Trump\u2019s decision on April 14, 2020. According to the news outlet, Trump\u2019s name is expected to appear in the memo line of the check, not as the payment\u2019s official signatory, and that this will be the \u201cfirst time that a president\u2019s name appears on an IRS disbursement\u201d:\nThe Treasury Department has ordered President Trump\u2019s name printed on stimulus checks the Internal Revenue Service is rushing to send to tens of millions of Americans, a process that could slow their delivery by a few days, senior IRS officials said.\nThe unprecedented decision, finalized late Monday, means that when recipients open the $1,200 paper checks the IRS is scheduled to begin sending to 70 million Americans in coming days, \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump\u201d will appear on the left side of the payment.\nIt will be the first time a president\u2019s name appears on an IRS disbursement, whether a routine refund or one of the handful of checks the government has issued to taxpayers in recent decades either to stimulate a down economy or share the dividends of a strong one.\nTreasury officials disputed that the checks would be delayed.\nWhile Trump\u2019s name will appear on these stimulus checks, we can\u2019t predict whether these payments will be delayed or go out on time. A Treasury Department official said in a statement that \u201cabsolutely no delay whatsoever\u201d would occur:\u00a0\n\u201cEconomic Impact Payment checks are scheduled to go out on time and exactly as planned \u2014 there is absolutely no delay whatsoever \u2026 In fact, we expect the first checks to be in the mail early next week which is well in advance of when the first checks went out in 2008 and well in advance of initial estimates.\u201d\nIt should also be noted that many Americans will be receiving their stimulus payments via a direct deposit. It\u2019s unclear how many people will receive hard paper checks bearing Trump\u2019s name and how many will receive a digital payment.\u00a0\nAn IRS official told Fox News that the number of people who will receive paper checks was subject to a \u201cnumber of variables, including how much info the IRS obtains through the Non-Filers Enter Payment Info web portal and the Get My Payment portal launching [April 15] at IRS.gov.\u201c\nThese Economic Impact Payments were included in the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that Trump signed in late March 2020. According to the IRS, direct-deposit payments had already started going out as of the second week in April. Those waiting on a paper check, however, may not see their payments for several weeks. (If you\u2019re waiting on a payment, you can check the status of your check on a recently launched web app from the IRS.)\nTo sum up: It is true that in April 2020, the U.S. government made the unprecedented move of adding the president\u2019s name to stimulus checks issued by the IRS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

{"evidence": "U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings laid into Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan during a House Oversight Committee hearing on July 18, 2019, calling attention to the Trump administration\u2019s treatment of migrant children after reports they were being held in filthy, overcrowded conditions at border-detention facilities.\nSo began a snowballing reaction from U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters that started with attacks on Cummings, a long-serving Democratic congressman who represents Baltimore, eventually leading to pointing fingers at unrelated comments Sen. Bernie Sanders made in 2015.\nCummings, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, gave an emotional response when Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said the immigration agencies he oversees are \u201cdoing our level best\u201d to handle detained children at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\u201cWhat does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces, can\u2019t take a shower?\u201d Cummings asked, his voice rising. \u201cNone of us would have our children in that position.\u201d He added,\u00a0\u201cThey are human beings.\u201d\n\nCummings was responding to news reports of neglect and squalor at migrant facilities that have included details that children \u201cas young as 7 and 8, many of them wearing clothes caked with snot and tears, are caring for infants they\u2019ve just met, the lawyers said. Toddlers without diapers are relieving themselves in their pants. Teenage mothers are wearing clothes stained with breast milk.\u201d\nTrump responded to Cummings\u2019 criticism of his administration\u2019s treatment of migrants more than a week later by taking to Twitter to attack the congressman and the city of Baltimore, which is in Cummings\u2019 district. The Twitter tirade, in which Trump called Baltimore \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess,\u201d prompted some people to renew ongoing criticism that his recent comments targeting non-white leaders are racist.\nTrump found a new angle on the topic on July 29, 2019, six minutes after hosts on the Fox News morning talk show \u201cFox & Friends\u201d said during their broadcast that Sanders made disparaging comments about Baltimore while visiting the city in 2015.\n\nCrazy Bernie Sanders recently equated the City of Baltimore to a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet is misleading in that Sanders\u2019 comments weren\u2019t recent, and the speech in which Sanders made them occurred in a different context. Trump\u2019s complaint about being \u201clabeled a Racist\u201d reflects criticism he faced after he attacked several lawmakers of color, while Sanders, according to contemporaneous news reports, was attempting to win over potential black voters. The bulk of the race criticism came on July 14, 2019, after Trump tweeted that four female congresswomen, all of whom are people of color and U.S. citizens, should \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d\nSanders, an Independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats in Congress, gave the speech in question in Baltimore on Dec. 8, 2015. He said, \u201cThe fact of the matter is that America is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. But anyone who took the walk that we took around this neighborhood would not think you\u2019re in a wealthy nation. You would think that you\u2019re in a third world country.\u201d\nSanders was then, as he is as of this writing, running for president as a Democrat, and he gave the speech after he took a walking tour of the West Baltimore neighborhood where Freddie Gray was arrested. Gray died on April 19, 2015, from spinal cord injuries while in police custody, in a high-profile case that led to widespread anger and unrest over police violence directed at the black community.\nSanders\u2019 speech was not the equivalent in content or context to Trump\u2019s statement about Baltimore, despite efforts to paint it that way after the fact. Trump\u2019s comments were an attack on a political opponent, Cummings, who is African-American and who represents a city with a large black community. Sanders\u2019 speech, on the other hand, denounced structural racism in a reported effort to reach black voters.\nIn his speech, Sanders called out conditions in the community that were indicative of those faced by the broader African-American population, including economic inequality, higher unemployment, lack of educational opportunity, mass incarceration and even the lack of basic amenities, like grocery stores in some communities.\n\u201cThere is an enormous amount of work to be done and we have the people to do that work,\u201d Sanders said (his full speech can be viewed here.) \u201cWhat we need is changes in our national priorities and to stop ignoring those many, many millions of people who are hurting today, who are not receiving the kind of attention or redress that they are entitled to from their government.\u201d\nIn contrast, Trump\u2019s response to violence and unrest over the killing of Gray in 2015 was to blame then-President Barack Obama for it, again alluding to race.\nOur great African American President hasn\u2019t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 28, 2015\n\nSanders responded on Twitter on July 29, 2019, to Trump\u2019s comments about the 2015 speech:\nTrump\u2019s lies and racism never end.\nWhile I have been fighting to lift the people of Baltimore and elsewhere out of poverty with good paying jobs, housing and health care, he has been attacking workers and the poor. https://t.co/7N0K4GQgEO\n\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 29, 2019\nAlthough it\u2019s true that Sanders likened parts of Baltimore to a \u201cthird world country,\u201d he made the comments while visiting that city on the heels of racial unrest there to make a broader point about the need to fight structural racism.

{"evidence": "In the summer of 2018, many Americans were alarmed to read about the phenomenon of young immigrant children, without free legal aid, having to plead their cases before a judge in deportation and asylum cases.  For example, in a 27 June article,the  reported that:This report prompted inquiries from multiple skeptical and concerned readers asking us if it was true.The referenced practice does occur today and has taken place for years. We spoke with immigration attorneys who confirmed that immigrant children subject to deportation or asylum hearings are not entitled to court-appointed lawyers, and they recalled having represented clients as young as two and three years old.In the United States, any defendant in a criminal case is constitutionally entitled to be represented by a court-appointed attorney at no cost if they cannot afford to hire their own. However, this constitutional guarantee does not extend to civil cases or immigration courts (although in some states and some circumstances, state law does entitle individuals to free legal aid in civil cases).Instead, those who find themselves before immigration courts, whether adults or children, have the right, if not always the wherewithal, to obtain legal representation from one of a number of non-profit organizations and law firms who work on a pro bono basis.Although defendants do not have a right to court-appointed free legal aid in immigration court, the federal government does indirectly contribute to their assistance. The Office for Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, contracts with the non-profit Vera Institute for Justice, which in turn sub-contracts with more than a dozen organizations around the country to provide free legal representation and advice to immigrants facing deportation and other legal issues.In April 2018, during the same week that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented the \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy, the Executive Office for Immigration Review \u2014 which oversees the U.S. immigration court system \u2014 reportedly informed the Vera Institute that these legal assistance programs were to be put on hold pending a cost-effectiveness review.Sessions later announced that the programs would not be paused, but a review of their costs would still be taking place.According to statistics collected by Syracuse University, 58,015 unaccompanied children (i.e., juveniles under the age of 18 separated from their legal adult guardians) were subjected to deportation hearings in American immigration courts in 2017.That figure was 61,254 in 2016, and 35,113 in 2015. Between 2005 and 2017, some 300,000 unaccompanied children have had to appear in court in deportation hearings, and according to the data around half of children in deportation cases do not have legal representation. A child who doesn\u2019t have a lawyer is over four times more likely to receive a removal order (deportation) than a child who does. Between 2005 and May 2018, a total of 93,767 children left the United States, either through removal orders or voluntary departure, after being detained and subjected to immigration court deportation proceedings without legal representation.The figures from previous years, which related only  to unaccompanied children, can\u2019t be directly compared to those from 2018, which do not distinguish between children who arrived into the United States unaccompanied and those who arrived with their parents and families.However, we know that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy caused at least 2,342 children to be separated from their parents at the border, and since many of these children will be subject to deportation proceedings, it is quite plausible that an increase in the number of unaccompanied children appearing in immigration courts has occurred in 2018.In 2014, the American Immigration Council, the American Civil Liberties Union, and other non-profit organizations sued the U.S. government for alleged violations of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act, demanding that immigrant children be given court-appointed free legal aid in immigration proceedings.Thsee organizations brought suit () on behalf of fourteen immigrant children (some as young as four, three, or even one year old), all of whom were facing deportation hearings, before the case was certified as a class action and the group of plaintiffs expanded to thousands of children in similar circumstances. Attorneys for the children argued that:The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the lawsuit in 2016 on a question of jurisdiction and rejected a similar high-profile lawsuit in January 2018, leaving in place the status quo: thousands of children with no right to court-appointed attorneys in immigration court.Megan McKenna is communications director at Kids in Need of Defense, a charity devoted specifically to advancing and upholding the rights of children in immigration policy. She told us that the youngest child the organization had formally represented in immigration court was just two years old.No rules or guidelines currently in place establish a minimum age below which children can\u2019t be forced to defend themselves in court, according to McKenna. The court does provide a translator, if necessary, but most protections and services for children are at the discretion of judges who can, for example, delay a hearing to give a child time to find legal representation but are not obliged to do so.McKenna described the process as \u201cunforgiving,\u201d adding that \u201cThey\u2019re all coming for a very difficult reason. No child would come on their own, hundreds or thousands of miles, unless something was really wrong.\u201dThe debate over whether children (as opposed to adults) should be entitled to taxpayer-funded free legal aid in immigration cases partially revolves around the question of whether children, as a category, are less capable than adults of both understanding their circumstances and the questions put to them by a judge, performing the logical processes required to put together an argument on their own behalf, and verbalizing that argument with sufficient clarity and impact.In 2016, Jack Weil, a U.S. Justice Department official responsible for training immigration judges, sparked controversy with remarks he made during a deposition in the  class action case. Weil suggested that three- and four-year-old children could be \u201ctaught immigration law,\u201d although he later maintained that his comments had been taken out of context.\u00a0During Weil\u2019s deposition, ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham questioned him as follows (page 69):We posed a series of questions to the U.S. Department of Justice relating to the presence of children in immigration courts, including whether any rules prevented children with intellectual disabilities from being ordered to defend themselves, what the specific criteria are for a judge to determine whether a child is capable of functioning in court, as well as the number unaccompanied children who have been subject to immigration court proceedings so far in 2018, but did not receive a response by press time.", "claim": "Children in immigration court do not have the right to free, court-appointed attorneys.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}

{"evidence": "After Illinois teen Kyle Rittenhouse was charged with fatally shooting two people and wounding another during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug. 25, 2020, Snopes received numerous inquiries from readers wondering if a self-described Christian crowdfunding website was hosting a fundraiser to supposedly help pay Rittenhouse\u2019s legal defense.\nThe killings occurred during a chaotic confrontation between people protesting the Aug. 23 police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, and armed vigilantes who claimed to be patrolling the lakeside city to prevent looting and property destruction. Rittenhouse, 17, was captured in video footage carrying a military-style rifle, marching alongside members of the latter group, and putting his hands up after shots were fired. Authorities arrested him on Aug. 26 in connection with the deaths in Antioch, Illinois, where he was being held without bail and awaiting his next court hearing on Sept. 25.\nThe charges against Rittenhouse included first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a life sentence. The Chicago Tribune reported:\nRittenhouse\u2019s case immediately became a popular cause in conservative circles, where pundits began defending the teenager before he had even been charged. At least two defense funds have been launched in his name in recent days, though it\u2019s unclear if the Rittenhouse family supports either of those efforts.\nThat brings us to the question from Snopes readers: Was a website that brands itself as Christian called GiveSendGo hosting an apparent online fundraiser to help Rittenhouse pay court costs?\nFirst, we searched several crowdfunding sites for online campaigns with a similar stated goal: to raise money to help Rittenhouse or his family fight criminal charges against him. None appeared on GoFundMe, as of this report.\nSeveral crowdfunding pages, however, were active and allegedly supporting Rittenhouse\u2019s case on Fundly (see partial search results below). Additionally, a conservative student group at Arizona State University pledged to donate half of its future fundraising dollars to the cause. \u201c[Rittenhouse] does not deserve to have his entire life destroyed because of the actions of violent anarchists during a lawless riot,\u201d the college group tweeted.\n\nNext, we considered crowdfunding platforms that describe themselves as Christian and researched GiveSendGo at readers\u2019 requests. According to the website, which describes itself as the \u201c#1 Free Christian Crowdfunding Site,\u201d users can organize and run crowdsourcing campaigns for free by using personalized logins and donate to GiveSendGo directly. The website\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d page stated:\nGiveSendGo is meant to give Christians the opportunity to be supported by the body of Christ. A place for the body of Christ to get out from their comfortable pews and support people in God\u2019s family that they might not have ever known about. [\u2026] A place for Christians.\nBased on that evidence, it was accurate to claim GiveSendGo describes itself as a website that promotes Christianity.\nThen we looked for proof of pages supporting Rittenhouse on the platform. A keyword search for \u201cKyle Rittenhouse\u201d uncovered several pages, including a fundraiser titled \u201cRaise Money For Kyle Rittenhouse Legal Defense\u201d that had raised more than $314,000 as of this report.\nIt was the most popular and active GiveSendGo campaign created to supposedly help the teen or his family. The page included the following the description:\nKyle Rittenhouse just defended himself from a brutal attack by multiple members of the far-leftist group ANTIFA \u2013 the experience was undoubtedly a brutal one, as he was forced to take two lives to defend his own.\nNow, Kyle is being unfairly charged with murder 1, by a DA who seems determined only to capitalize on the political angle of the situation. The situation was clearly self-defense, and Kyle and his family will undoubtedly need money to pay for the legal fees.\nLet\u2019s give back to someone who bravely tried to defend his community.\nOn Aug. 28, 2020, the page\u2019s organizers \u2014 \u201cFriends of the Rittenhouse family\u201d of Atlanta, Georgia \u2014 wrote an update to the page in which they claimed they had spoken with Rittenhouse\u2019s mother and legal team and that that party was raising money via multiple methods. The organizers of the GiveSendGo campaign pledged: \u201cAll of the money donated \u2026 will go to Kyle\u2019s defense, as it is likely to be an expensive and protracted affair.\u201d \nNo specific details on the GiveSendGo page\u2019s organizers were known, including how or under what circumstances they started the alleged fundraiser. Anyone can establish a campaign on the site; donors are encouraged to report pages that appear suspicious or fraudulent, and there was no evidence to confirm or deny the organizers of the campaign for Rittenhouse were indeed giving the payments to help his legal defense, aside from the above-described pledge from them. That update also read:\nKyle is reportedly in good spirits, and I\u2019m told that the incredible support shown by you good people is what\u2019s keeping him going.\n\u2026 This young man has reinvigorated the faith of many that this country and its founding principles are indeed founded upon the rock, not built upon the sand.\nHowever, a city upon a hill cannot be hid; Kyle now faces the wrath of those who would see us stripped of our God-given rights and reduced to servitude. He is in dire need of our help.\nThe GiveSendGo page collected more than 7,330 donations as of this report, some of which included messages of support for Rittenhouse. \u201cThis young man is a hero. Give him a medal and make him a millionaire. Every patriot can spare him a few bucks\u201d said an anonymous donor who contributed $10, per the page. Another donor said:\n\nBased on those findings \u2014 yes, a self-described Christian crowdfunding website GiveSendGo was hosting a campaign to supposedly help Rittenhouse \u2014 we reached out to the website\u2019s administrators to learn under what terms it hosts campaigns on its platform. Jacob Wells, a co-founder of the site, told us via email:\nGiveSendGo allows campaigns from all kinds of different people and political/religious ideologies. Just because we are Christians does not mean every campaign on our site has to be one or that we agree with its campaign premise.\n[\u2026] We will withhold judgement and leave that for the courts and God. Our judicial system works on the principle of innocence until proven guilty. As a veteran owned platform we recognize the freedoms we have in the USA came at a very high price and we will not just trample on them to satisfy political correctness.\nAdditionally, he said site administrators were conducting a review of the page involving Rittenhouse to make sure it follows site guidelines, though they \u201ccurrently believe the campaign is eligible like any other campaigns because it does not violate our terms of service.\u201d\nOn Aug. 27 the crowdfunding site posted the following statement to Twitter:\n\nThe campaign stoked controversy online among people who believed it wrongfully celebrated the actions of an alleged killer and should be removed from the crowdfunding website. Referring to Blake, who was paralyzed from the waist down after a white police officer shot at his back multiple times on Aug. 23, one Facebook user alleged:\n\nIn response to those critics, Wells told Snopes:\nWe recognize that we live in a world of diverse ideas and opinions and that part of our strength is in that diversity. We will respond with grace to those that disagree with us. We will give grace to ourselves to not always get it right as we learn and grown. Finally we will give grace to the campaign owner, those that support the campaign, and Kyle as he walk out [sic] the ramifications of his actions.\nIn sum, given how GiveSendGo describes itself \u2014 the \u201c#1 Free Christian Crowdfunding Site\u201d \u2014 as well as evidence of listed donations on a webpage that says it will give all contributions to help fund Rittenhouse\u2019s legal defense, we rate this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d", "claim": "A crowdfunding campaign on the Christian site GiveSendGo solicited donations to help Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old accused of killing two people at a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}

{"evidence": "In the midst of an ongoing public debate about national anthem protests by NFL players that grew to involve even President Donald Trump in September 2017, Internet users were reminded of an infamous 1980s lawsuit involving the now-defunct United States Football League and the NFL in which Trump had played a key role:Trump repeatedly called for the upstart league to go head-to-head with the NFL by switching its playing season to the fall and winter, once saying: \u201cMy attitude has always been [that] the spring was a wasteland, and I came into this league on the basis [of], and predicated on the fact, that I thought the league would move to the fall.\u201dOn this point, Trump faced opposition from others within the USFL, in particular John Bassett, the influential owner of the Tampa Bay Bandits. Ultimately, Trump\u2019s view won out, and in 1984 the USFL announced that their 1986 season would begin in the fall.Trump later described  himself as the \u201cleading catalyst\u201d for the decision to move to the USFL season to the fall, although in 1987 the USFL\u2019s former director of communications, Jim Byrne, presented an account of the spring/fall schism within the league that emphasized the role of Harry Usher, who had become USFL commissioner in 1985.However, the planned change in seasons did not work out so well in practice, as the USFL faced severe difficulties in obtaining contracts with major television networks (a key source of revenue), among other problems, which brings us to the lawsuit now so frequently connected with Donald Trump.The source provided for the meme displayed above was a 25 September 2017  article that extensively quoted business journalist Joe Nocera, who offered his recollections about the USFL\u2019s scheduling problems and their response to them:According to a 30 July 1986 report from the , the jury ruled that the NFL had violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by retaining a monopoly power \u201cto control prices or exclude competition\u201d in the country\u2019s professional football market. But jurors awarded such low damages because Judge Peter Leisure had told them they should do so if they were not able to say definitively that the losses suffered by the USFL were caused by the NFL\u2019s control of the market, as opposed to the USFL\u2019s own poor management.Trump hailed the verdict as a \u201cgreat moral victory,\u201d and the USFL launched a series of motions and appeals that culminated in 1990. But on the playing field, the 1986 USFL was postponed just days after the trial concluded, and the USFL never staged another game.Donald Trump was not a plaintiff in the USFL lawsuit in a personal capacity, but the team he owned, the New Jersey Generals, was one of the plaintiffs.  Moreover, Trump\u2019s long-time personal lawyer, Roy Cohn, was one of the attorneys for the USFL, and both Trump and Cohn gave press conferences and interviews about the case, criticizing the NFL and supporting the USFL\u2019s arguments. And Trump himself testified during the trial.So while Donald Trump may not have been a plaintiff in the ultimately disastrous lawsuit against the NFL, a team he owned was, and it would be entirely reasonable to say he was a driving force behind the litigation.The final component of the meme, that the NFL levied a \u201clifetime ban\u201d against Donald Trump for his role in the USFL lawsuit, is difficult to rate.  Presumably it refers to Trump\u2019s efforts to obtain an NFL franchise, something then-commissioner Pete Rozelle stated he would never allow, according to Leslie Schupak, senior managing partner at KCSA Worldwide, the USFL\u2019s marketing and public relations firm:So, this aspect boils down to a second-hand account (which was contradicted by one of the participants) of former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle\u2019s supposedly telling Trump in private that he would never allow Trump to own an NFL franchise.  However, any such personal feelings that Rozelle (who died in 1996) may have held along those lines is not codified or enforceable as an NFL rule today.  Moreover, Rozelle reportedly formed his opinion of Trump\u2019s undesirability as an owner back in 1984, two years prior to the USFL\u2019s filing their anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL, so that litigation could not have been the motivation behind Rozelle\u2019s purported \u201clifetime ban\u201d of Trump from the NFL.On the whole, there are elements of this meme that are accurate: the existence of the lawsuit, the amount of damages, the involvement of Donald Trump. But the meme also fails to make it clear that Trump did not sue the NFL in a personal capacity, and the claim about the NFL\u2019s giving the future president a \u201clifetime ban\u201d is questionable.", "claim": "The NFL gave Donald Trump a \"lifetime ban\" after he was involved in a disastrous lawsuit against the league.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "On 27 August 2017, as the full damage to Texas from a storm of historic proportions was not yet fully known, a number of social media posts began to spread, alerting readers to a change in Texas law around insurance claims in the event of weather damage.\u00a0One Facebook user\u00a0posted\u00a0the following:Former Texas state representative Glen Maxey wrote:And on 29 August, Rep. Joaqu\u00edn Castro encouraged Texans affected by Tropical Storm Harvey to file their claims before 1 September:Texas House Bill 1774 does indeed introduce changes to the way property damage insurance claims are dealt with in the state, but only in the event of a litigated dispute over a claim. Most insurance claims are settled out of court, and so the potential benefit in filing a claim before 1 September 2017 (which is itself marginal) will likely not apply in most cases.The real benefit would be in filing a  before 1 September, but for obvious practical reasons, it is extremely unlikely that someone whose home has been destroyed or extensively damaged days earlier, would be in a position to do this.\u00a0The law was signed by Governor Greg Abbott on 26 May 2017.The first major provision in the law is that an individual or business filing a lawsuit in relation to a weather-related property damage insurance claim (including flood damage) will have to give their insurance company 61 days\u2019 notice before initiating litigation.According to an analysis published by the independent House Research Organization in the Texas House of Representatives:The second major provision in HB 1774 is that it imposes a claim recovery threshold in order for individuals to recover the full amount of their attorney\u2019s fees, if they decide to go to court. If, in the event of a lawsuit, a jury decides to award a plaintiff 80 percent or more of the amount they are claiming, then all that individual\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees will be covered. If a jury decides to award 20 percent or less, none of their attorney\u2019s fees are covered:We consulted two experts on insurance: Etti Baranoff, an associate professor of finance at Virginia Commonwealth University and a former regulator at the Texas Department of Insurance, and Dalit Baranoff, a historian of insurance policy who runs the Risks and Consequences blog.\u00a0They told us the bill is designed to discourage consumers from taking a claim to court and filing exaggerated claims, but otherwise doesn\u2019t change the process of settling claims out of court.\u00a0This is where the 61-day waiting period comes into play, which the Baranoffs say is \u201cmeant to encourage mediation and out-of-court settlement\u201d, and the 80/20 rule in the new law will make it harder for people to recoup their legal costs if they decide to sue. The reasoning behind this, according to the Baranoffs, is to discourage inflated or exaggerated claims, since claimants will be less likely to be awarded 80 percent or more of a relatively large claim and are therefore more likely to have to pay some attorney\u2019s fees if they do.\u00a0Indeed, the stated purpose of HB 1774 was to stop a historic increase in the number of hailstorm-related property damage insurance claims, something the bill\u2019s sponsor State Representative Greg Bonnen called \u201cthe worst lawsuit abuse we have in the state\u201d (Relevant portion begins at\u00a03:50).Tanya Pierce, Associate Professor of Law at Texas A&M University, previously practiced in the area of complex litigation and insurance coverage. She told us there is only one potential benefit to homeowners in filing a written claim before 1 September 2017:Again, however, this benefit only accrues if the homeowner later decides to sue the insurance company.Under current law, Pierce says, an insurance company would have to pay 18 percent interest on whatever they owed in the event that a consumer successfully sues them for a delayed payment. Under the new law, she points out, companies would have to pay a  rate of interest arrived at by adding 5 percent to the interest rate determined under Sec. 304.003, Financial Code (Sec. 2c).\u00a0So there is a potential benefit in filing a claim before 1 September 2017, but only if you then later file a successful lawsuit in the event of a dispute over your payment.\u00a0The new law will not have a direct effect on insurance claims that are settled out of court, and most insurance claims are settled out of court. However, the law could make it slower and more difficult for homeowners to get paid what they believe they are owed if they start litigation after 1 September 2017. It will also make suing insurance companies more financially risky.If a consumer were to file a lawsuit against their insurance company before 1 September, they could experience a significant benefit from having done so. However, if their home has been extensively damaged just before 1 September 2017 (by historically catastrophic flooding, for example), it is extremely unlikely they would be able, practically speaking, to find and hire an attorney and file a suit before 1 September.\u00a0They would also have to have a reasonable basis to sue \u2014\u00a0a dispute over their claim, or an insurance company\u2019s refusal to pay, for example \u2014\u00a0a process that there simply wasn\u2019t time for between the arrival of Tropical Storm Harvey on 26 August and the enactment of the new law on 1 September.The only potential benefit from filing a claim before 1 September is that if someone later decides to sue the insurance company and wins, the company will be obliged to pay them the higher, pre-September rate of interest on what they owe.\u00a0The claims contained in viral Facebook posts on 27 August 2017 are a largely accurate description of the provisions of HB 1774, but they do lack important context and do not make it clear to readers that the law only affects how claims are dealt with in the event that someone decides to sue an insurance company. These posts do not include that most insurance claims are settled out of court, and will therefore not be directly affected by the change in the law.\u00a0", "claim": "On 1 September 2017, a new law will come into force in Texas, making it harder for consumers to get paid for property insurance claims related to weather.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "In late June 2018, a number of media sources relayed a warning from the City of Buckeye (Arizona) Fire Department to the effect that residents should watch for rattlesnakes hiding in pool noodles (long, cylindrical pool toys, usually hollow, made of polyethylene foam).\u00a0According to , the warning \u2014 which was issued on Facebook\u00a0\u2014 was based on a report the fire department received from a local resident:The Facebook alert was posted\u00a0on 23 June 2018, and was later edited to clarify a confusing statement suggesting that rattlesnake eggs had been found in a pool noodle (rattlesnakes\u00a0don\u2019t lay eggs):It was unclear whether the entire post was written by someone at the fire department, however, or parts of it were simply copied from the message passed along to them. It was also unclear whether firefighters had personally investigated and verified the details of the incident. (We reached out to the City of Buckeye Fire Department for clarification on these points but did not hear back by publication time.)Rattlesnake experts interviewed by various news venues seemed to find it plausible that rattlesnakes would seek refuge from extremely hot weather inside pool noodles, though none cited specific instances of it having occurred before.\u00a0There is evidence that other kinds of snakes have been found in or near pool noodles, including a photo posted on the fire department\u2019s Facebook page showing what appears to be a harmless water snake  one of the pool toys:We also found a YouTube video uploaded in May 2018, which shows a snake (though it does not appear to be a rattler) being shaken out of a pool noodle:Hughes\u2019s safety suggestions included storing pool toys well off the ground or in a box, and installing snake fencing to keep snakes away from the pool in general.

{"evidence": "On July 16, 2020, as the U.S. recorded its single highest number of COVID-19 cases since the coronavirus health crisis began, U.S. President Donald Trump spoke at an event held on the South Lawn of the White House, ostensibly on the subject of \u201cRolling Back Regulations to Help All Americans.\u201d During his talk, according to a meme, Trump allegedly tackled the subject of energy-efficiency standards which have supposedly resulted in home appliances that do not function properly due to requirements aimed at conserving the amount of water and power they consume:\n\nThis was an accurate reproduction of a portion of Trump\u2019s talk, according to a White House transcript of the event:\nWe\u2019re bringing back consumer choice in home appliances so that you can buy washers and dryers, showerheads and faucets. So showerheads \u2014 you take a shower, the water doesn\u2019t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn\u2019t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair \u2014 I don\u2019t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect.\nDishwashers \u2014 you didn\u2019t have any water, so you \u2014 the people that do the dishes \u2014 you press it, and it goes again, and you do it again and again. So you might as well give them the water because you\u2019ll end up using less water. So we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water. And in many places \u2014 in most places of the country, water is not a problem. They don\u2019t know what to do with it. It\u2019s called \u201crain.\u201d They don\u2019t have a problem.\nThis was far from the first time the president had riffed on poorly functioning appliances. In December 2019, as Trump spoke in the Roosevelt Room of the White House amidst an impeachment inquiry, he digressed into railing about toilets and other bathroom fixtures that allegedly frustrate their users due to the use of low-flow technology. CNN reported:\nThe President claimed Americans are flushing their toilets \u201c10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once\u201d and argued that they are having difficulty with washing their hands in what appeared to be a tangent about low-flow sinks and toilets.\n\u201cWe have a situation where we\u2019re looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on \u2014 and in areas where there\u2019s tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don\u2019t get any water,\u201d the President said during a roundtable with small business leaders about deregulatory actions.\n\u201cYou turn on the faucet and you don\u2019t get any water. They take a shower and water comes dripping out. Just dripping out, very quietly dripping out,\u201d the President continued, lowering his voice as he spoke about the drips. \u201cPeople are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t entirely clear what he was talking about, but it appeared to have to do with bathroom fixtures with low-flow appliances. He said the Environmental Protection Agency was looking into the issue on his suggestion.\n\u201cThey end up using more water. So (the) EPA is looking at that very strongly at my suggestion,\u201d Trump said, though he did not give details on what suggestions, if any, he made.\nNPR quoted the Pacific Institute, a non-profit research institute with a focus on global and regional freshwater issues, as asserting that Trump\u2019s statements did not comport with reality:\nPeter Gleick with the Pacific Institute in Oakland considers this all to be Trumpian nostalgia for a time when showers were strong, toilets used 4 gallons a flush and lightbulbs burned your hands when you touched them.\nGleick said these newer household items are part of an \u201cefficiency revolution,\u201d doing the same tasks with less and halting the upward trajectory of water and energy consumption in America. And, yes, a dishwasher cycle takes longer, and incandescent bulbs are cheaper to buy upfront.\nBut in the long run, \u201cThey\u2019re much more expensive, because they use a huge amount of energy, which we pay for over time and they burn out 20 times faster,\u201d Gleick said.\nBased on the way Trump talks about efficient lightbulbs, it seems his complaint is with compact fluorescent bulbs, which were the only low-energy bulbs widely available 10 years ago. But today, store shelves are full of LED bulbs with warmer-looking light and even longer life spans. Gleick suspects Trump\u2019s toilet complaints are outdated as well, because low-flow toilet technology has come a long way in recent years.\n\u201cSome people got bad toilets, but that was 15 and 20 years ago,\u201d Gleick said. \u201cAnd now the new toilets not only use a tiny fraction of the water the old toilets used to use, but the truth is they flush better \u2014 and if you have a bad toilet that doesn\u2019t flush, well, that\u2019s because you have a bad toilet.\u201d\nA video of the portion of the speech reproduced in the above meme can be viewed here:\nTrump: So shower heads, you take a shower, the water doesn\u2019t come out.

{"evidence": "In the summer of 2018, President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy was met with widespread criticism, prompting the Trump administration to scale back elements of the plan (which saw thousands of children separated from their parents at the southwestern border) after less than three months.However, the opposition to that policy prompted allegations of hypocrisy leveled by supporters of President Trump against his predecessor, Barack Obama. Some of those comparisons were inaccurate and misleading, as we have examined here previously.Commentators and social media users brought up an old statement made by Barack Obama back when he was a U.S. Senator representing Illinois, in which he expressed opposition to \u201cundetected, undocumented, unchecked\u201d immigration. The highlighting of that statement was intended to create an equivalence between the views expressed by Barack Obama in 2005 and the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy enacted by his successor in the White House in 2018, and (either explicitly or implicitly) level the charge of partisan opportunism and hypocrisy against liberal opponents of Trump\u2019s policies.On 23 June, Fox News contributor Gary Kaltbaum appeared on  and read out the statement in question:On 18 June 2018, the quote was posted on the popular pro-Trump Reddit forum /The_Donald, and on 23 July, Val DiGiorgio (chairman of the Chester County, Pennsylvania Republican party) posted a meme showing a photograph of Obama along with the same quote that Kaltbaum read out on Fox News:Obama did indeed speak these words in 2005, and also said something very similar in 2006, although his expressed opposition to unchecked illegal immigration in 2005 was not the same as support for the \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy implemented by the Trump administration in 2018.On 15 December 2005, Barack Obama joined Republican Senator Mel Martinez of Florida in a press conference about bipartisan efforts to bring about immigration reform, during which the former stated:Obama then laid out the three basic principles of his preferred approach to immigration reform: enhanced border security and enforcement, a guest worker program and electronic verification capabilities for employers, and an \u201cinterim legal status\u201d for the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States whereby those who entered the country illegally would pay a \u201chefty fine\u201d and \u201cgo to the back of the line\u201d before applying for U.S. citizenship.The future president repeatedly criticized any approach to immigration reform that focused only on enforcement measures. Immediately after uttering the words that would be recirculated in 2018, Senator Obama continued on to say:On 3 April 2006, Senator Obama spoke from the floor of the Senate on the subject of immigration reform. In the time-honored tradition of politicians everywhere, the senator re-used many of the phrases and arguments he had deployed a few months earlier:However, Obama again emphasized that enhancing enforcement alone would not, in his opinion, be an effective way to reform the U.S. immigration system. He also again underscored his support for a three-pronged approach: better border security and enforcement, a guest worker program with enhanced protections for the rights of immigrant workers and a system for employers to check the legal status of would-be employees, and a conditional path to citizenship for immigrants who had entered the country illegally.(A full transcript of Obama\u2019s 2006 remarks is available here, on page 24.)In 2005, Obama did say: \u201cWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States, undetected, undocumented, unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country.\u201d And he said something very similar a few months later, in 2006.However, in doing so he was merely articulating an orthodox, relatively uncontroversial position among most American politicians: that the U.S. ought not to have open, unmonitored borders, and immigrants who applied for a visa to live and work in the U.S. should be treated preferentially to those who simply crossed the border without legal status.At no time during the 2005 or 2006 speeches in question did Obama advocate the equivalent of a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy of processing even first-time \u201cimproper\u201d border crossings via criminal trials, a prosecutorial shift which has necessitated the mass separation of children from parents at the southwestern border (a system we have written about in greater detail elsewhere).During his tenure as president, Barack Obama did oversee the criminal prosecution of some illegal border crossers (as opposed to the traditional approach of administrative removal), under a program known as Operation Streamline begun in 2005 during the administration of President George W. Bush. However, this approach was still largely limited to repeat offenders or those with criminal records, and first-time \u201cimproper\u201d entrants into the United States typically continued to be processed administratively before being deported.Crucially, the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April 2018 prescribed the criminal prosecution of  individuals crossing the border unlawfully, even for the first time \u2014 a distinctive characteristic of the Trump policy, and the one that brought about the separation of thousands of families at the border, during the spring and summer of 2018.President Obama also oversaw an increase in the rate of deportations during his tenure as president, something that brought about the separation of some immigrant families already residing in the United States. But those families were not typically separated at the border, and this increase in deportations was partly attributable to a change in definitions used in compiling immigration statistics.", "claim": "In 2005, Senator Barack Obama expressed his opposition to \"undetected, undocumented, unchecked\" immigration.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}
{"evidence": "In February 2020, news outlets such as The Intercept, CBS News, and The BBC published articles reporting that Native American burial sites in southern Arizona were at risk of being, or had already been, damaged during construction of a section of the U.S.-Mexico border wall in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.\u00a0\nThe Intercept, for instance, reported on Feb. 6:\nContractors working for the Trump administration are blowing apart a mountain on protected lands in southern Arizona to make way for the president\u2019s border wall. The blasting is happening on the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a tract of Sonoran Desert wilderness long celebrated as one of the nation\u2019s great ecological treasures, that holds profound spiritual significance to multiple Native American groups.\nThese reports originated with credible news outlets, yet some readers found the news hard to believe. We received several queries asking if the reports were true. While we recommend reading the articles published by The Intercept, CBS News, and The BBC, we\u2019ll respond to readers\u2019 most pressing questions below.\u00a0\nIs There a Native American Burial Site on Monument Hill?\nIn early February 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) started construction on a segment of border wall inside Arizona\u2019s Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. CBP officials confirmed that \u201ccontrolled blasting\u201d had started in an area within the Roosevelt Reservation at Monument Mountain, which is also known as Monument Hill.\nThe Intercept reported:\n\u201cIn a statement to The Intercept, U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that the blasting began this week and will continue through the end of the month. \u201cThe construction contractor has begun controlled blasting, in preparation for new border wall system construction, within the Roosevelt Reservation at Monument Mountain in the U.S. Border Patrol\u2019s Tucson Sector,\u201d the statement said, referring to an area also known as Monument Hill. \u201cThe controlled blasting is targeted and will continue intermittently for the rest of the month.\u201d\nOrgan Pipe Cactus National Monument is located in southern Arizona and sits just above the border of the United States and Mexico. To the east of this national park is the Tohono O\u2019odham Indian Reservation. According to tribe leaders, as well as archaeologists, Monument Hill is home to a Native American burial site.\u00a0\nIn January 2020, Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva surveyed the area with Ned Norris Jr., the chairman of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, Peter Steer, the tribe\u2019s historic preservation officer, and a group of archaeologists. Here\u2019s how Monument Hill was described in a set of briefing notes compiled by Grijalva\u2019s staff after the visit:\nArchaeologists noted that Tribal elders were interviewed and identified this hill as sacred to the O\u2019odham. This hill is first documented and mentioned in Father Kino\u2019s letters when there was no Sonoita. During Apache raids, if a body was found after battle the tribe would place the bodies on this hill. Meaning there are bodies of other tribes in Arizona among this Hill with bone fragments. DHS mentioned that they would back off on developing the Hill, but the work is still being done (as you can see the road is widened in the photos/video) even after the tribe mentioned the cultural and historic significance of this area in a letter. Archeologist Edward Abbey also mentioned Monument Hill and its significance to the tribe in his archeology papers published in 1960s.\nSteer provided similar information to AZ Central. According to Steer, Monument Hill was once used for religious ceremonies and was also the resting place of fallen soldiers. Steer said that bone fragments had also been found on the hill and that the tribe has been able to date back mentions of the hill to the 1600s.\nAZ Central reported:\n\u201cThis hill, from the information we\u2019ve been able to gather, was used by Hia-C\u2019ed O\u2019odham for religious ceremonies,\u201d Peter Steere said. \u201cThis is also a place, when the Apache were raiding out here, if the Apache warrior was killed, his body was placed on this hill.\u201d\nHe added that the tribe is able to track mentions of the hill dating back hundreds of years. They have found possible references in letters written by Father Eusebio Kino, the famed Jesuit missionary that proselytized the area in the late 1600s.\nThe tribe has documented information about the hill from O\u2019odham elders, as well as archaeologists who have worked in the area.\n\u201cWe have found a couple of places with bone fragments up here,\u201d Steere said.\nWhen Rep. Grijalva visited the area in January 2020, construction had not yet started. The Arizona congressman sent a letter to acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf expressing concern over the border wall\u2019s potential impact on the national monument and asked the government to address certain issues, such as the location and schedule for construction and the protection of groundwater resources. Grijalva said that he never received a response to his letter and in February 2020 construction crews began \u201ccontrolled blasting\u201d in the area.\u00a0\nGrijalva told The Intercept: \u201cIt\u2019s been really frustrating. [\u2026] You would think that in a situation like this, that involves human remains, burial sites, bone fragments that are traced and dated a thousand years or more back, that there would be some sensitivity, for lack of a better word, on the part of DHS and the administration. There is none.\u201d\nOn Feb. 9, 2020, Grijalva posted an update on social media stating that two of the four burial sites that he visited had already been disturbed by the construction of the border wall:\nI just got back from the border. \nThis week, Trump blew up a sacred Native American hill on public land to build his racist wall. \nWatch my new update and join the growing movement to stop the wall. #NoBorderWall pic.twitter.com/YgmS94vAwO\n\u2014 Raul M. Grijalva (@RepRaulGrijalva) February 9, 2020\n\nAren\u2019t Native American Burial Sites Protected?\nThe U.S. does have laws such as the Environmental Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Native American Graves Protection Act. However, these laws can be circumvented if the government deems that they are at odd with national security.\nCBS News reports that the 2005 REAL ID Act gives the government \u201cbroad power to waive\u201d laws that stand in the way of national security:\nThe Trump administration has been able to legally construct the border wall over public land due in large part to a little known law passed in the wake of the 9/11.\nThe REAL ID Act of 2005 gives the federal government broad power to waive other laws that stand in the way of national security. Under REAL ID, the Trump administration has waived dozens of laws \u2014 including the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Environmental Protection Act \u2014 in its bid to construct the border wall.\n\u201cOf the 21 times the (REAL ID) waiver has been enacted since 2005, 16 of those instances have occurred in the last two and a half years,\u201d reads the letter Grijalva sent to Homeland Security.\nWhat Has CBP Done to Minimize the Impact of the Border Wall in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument?\nCBP does have an \u201cenvironmental monitor\u201d present during construction; an agency official also said that crews identify the \u201cbest construction management practices to minimize impacts on the environment to the greatest extent possible.\u201d\nWe reached out to CBP for more information about their efforts to minimize the environmental impact of the border wall and will update this article when more information becomes available.\u00a0\nGrijalva was skeptical that these environmental monitors would do anything to prevent further damage to these sacred sites.\u00a0\nGrijalva told The Intercept that he had zero faith that the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s \u201cenvironmental monitor will do anything to avoid, mitigate, or even point out some of the sacrilegious things that are occurring and will continue to occur, given the way they\u2019re proceeding.\u201d\nAre Other Native American Burial or Archaeological Sites at Risk?\nGrijalva was not the first to raise concerns about the border wall\u2019s impact on the area. A 123-page internal report from the park service obtained by The Washington Post via a Freedom of Information Act request warned that the border wall\u2019s construction could damage 22 archaeological sites at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument:\nBulldozers and excavators rushing to install President Trump\u2019s border barrier could damage or destroy up to 22 archaeological sites within Arizona\u2019s Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in coming months, according to an internal National Park Service report obtained by The Washington Post.\nThe administration\u2019s plan to convert an existing five-foot-high vehicle barrier into a 30-foot steel edifice could pose irreparable harm to unexcavated remnants of ancient Sonoran Desert peoples.

{"evidence": "During the coronavirus pandemic of spring 2020, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York remained at the top of the news cycle for two reasons: His state saw by far the largest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and his daily press briefings were a staple of television news coverage of the crisis. The New York governor was also praised as a model of political leadership during an emergency by those who were highly critical of President Donald Trump and his handling of the U.S. federal response to COVID-19.\nDuring that period, a meme circulated via social media stating that Cuomo had recently requested and been granted a $71,000 pay raise that made him the highest-paid governor in the U.S., and that this activity had taken place \u201cwhile most NYers were sleeping\u201d:\n\nIt was true that Cuomo had been granted a pay raise that would make him (at least temporarily) the highest-paid governor of any state. But that pay adjustment had been recommended and enacted a year earlier (i.e., in 2019, not 2020), the $71,000 increase was phased in across the span of three years (rather than given all at once), and the matter involved multiple recommendations and approvals from state authorities (largely given because the governor\u2019s salary not increased since 1999) which were openly publicized and not hidden from New York residents.\nOn April 1, 2019, both houses of the New York Legislature (Assembly and Senate) approved a pay hike that would increase Cuomo\u2019s compensation from $179,500 to $200,000 in 2019, $225,000 in 2020, and $250,000 in 2021. In terms of base salary, that raise created the potential for Cuomo to become the nation\u2019s highest-paid governor in 2020, out-earning Gov. Gavin Newsom of California (assuming that no other state raised its chief executive\u2019s pay to a higher level before then).\nThe gubernatorial pay hike was one of several salary increases that had been recommended back in December 2018 by the New York State Compensation Committee, which \u201cafter months of research and public hearings,\u201d advocated substantial pay raises for multiple high-level state officers \u2014 many of whom would, like the governor, would see phased pay increases eventually garnering them well over $200,000 per year:\nA four-member committee has recommended substantial pay raises for members of the state Legislature, the governor, lieutenant governor, state comptroller and state attorney general.\nThe New York State Compensation Committee \u2014 consisting of current and former New York state and New York City comptrollers \u2014 unveiled their recommendations Monday, December 10, 2018, after months of research and public hearings.\nThe Compensation Committee recommends that, starting on Jan. 1 of 2019, state legislators will receive an annual salary of $110,000.\nBeginning on Jan. 1, 2020, lawmakers will receive an annual salary of $120,000 and their outside income would be capped at $18,000, which 15 percent of their legislative pay.\nBeginning on Jan. 1, 2021, lawmakers would receive $130,000 a year and their outside income would be capped at $19,500, which is 15 percent of their legislative pay. This would be the long-term compensation for state legislators moving forward.\nThe Compensation Committee is also recommending pay increases for the governor, who would receive an annual salary of $250,000 after a three-year phase-in; the lieutenant governor, who would receive $220,000 after a three-year phase-in; and an annual salary of $220,000 for both the state comptroller and state attorney general after a phase-in period.\nExecutive branch commissioners and department heads would also receive pay raises under the plan, with Tier A commissioners making $220,000 after a three-year phase-in.\nAs the New York Post reported, some legislators \u201cgrumbled that the [pay raise] measure was thrown in at the last minute\u201d while they were working overtime to pass a state budget, but Cuomo and others defended it by noting that the compensation committee\u2019s recommendations had been published and accepted months earlier:\nBecause the governor can\u2019t sign off on his own pay hike, the raise required legislative action.\nThe state Senate approved the increase at 2:45 a.m. and the Assembly acted a few hours later.\nSome lawmakers grumbled that the measure was thrown in at the last minute, while they were grappling with the new $175.5 billion state budget.\n\u201cThe salary adjustments were done last December by the pay commission which publicized and put out a report, which was accepted by the legislature,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThat was published and discussed in December, so there\u2019s nothing new on that.\u201d\nAssembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) backed up Cuomo.\n\u201cIt has a fiscal component to it, so there\u2019s always the realization to do it,\u201d Heastie told reporters. \u201cWe felt that all the statewide officials were able to get raises \u2026 the governor and the lieutenant governor\u2019s salaries aren\u2019t fixed by statute, they have to be done by a concurrent resolution between the Assembly and the Senate and that\u2019s the reason why they were done.\u201d", "claim": "Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York recently received a little-publicized $71,000 pay raise that made him the highest paid governor in the U.S.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "In August 2020, as states and school districts in the United States grappled with whether and how to reopen schools for the fall semester, multiple readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of a social media post, shared widely by users in the United States, that claimed children who showed symptoms of COVID-19 could lawfully be quarantined outside their family home without the consent of their parents or guardians.\u00a0\nThe post, which typically began \u201cFor all the caring parents out there\u201d and often warned \u201cTHEY WILL BE REMOVING YOUR KIDS & YOU CANT [sic] DO OR SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT!\u201d consisted of an imagined conversation between a school teacher and a parent, as follows:\nTeacher: Sorry we have had to take your child to a testing centre [sic] as they were showing symptoms of corona (that means they could have a cold, temperature, a cough)\nParent: Right so where is my child?\nHT [Head teacher]: I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t disclose that information\nP [Parent]: Is my child ok?\nHT: I can assure you your child is in safe hands, in the mean time you need to self-isolate with your family for 14 days\nP: No I\u2019m coming to get my child now\nHT: I\u2019m sorry but if you arrive at the school we will have no choice but to call the police and have you removed from the premises.\nP: is this a joke? that is my child\nHT: I\u2019m sorry but under the new covid act we have the power to remove your child without your consent if we feel the have symptoms.\nP: So when will I see my child next\nHT: We will have a child service officer contact you.\nNow imagine this was a call from your Childs Headteacher\nI suggest every parent on my facebook gets off there [sic] ass and do some real research on the legislation of the covid act 2020 regarding the laws for children in school!!!!\n\nVersions of the post were originally shared by users in the United Kingdom earlier in August. Clues that the post originated outside the United States could be found in the use of the term \u201chead teacher\u201d (the British equivalent of an American school principal) and in the British spelling of \u201ctesting centre.\u201d The post also referred to a piece of legislation called the \u201cCOVID Act,\u201d claiming that the law authorized school authorities to \u201cremove\u201d children without parental consent if they presented symptoms of COVID-19.\u00a0\nA \u201cCoronavirus Act\u201d was passed by the U.K. Parliament in 2020, but it did not give school officials the powers claimed in the viral Facebook post. Versions of the post were subsequently shared by users in Canada, and its claims about the \u201cCOVID act\u201d were also false in that context.\nThe U.S. Congress passed no law in 2020 called the \u201cCoronavirus Act\u201d or the \u201cCOVID Act\u201d or \u201cCOVID-19 Act,\u201d so that particular aspect of the post was also false in the U.S. context on the federal level. We also checked the actions of state legislatures around the country. Based on our examination of the National Conference of State Legislatures database of COVID-19-related legislation, no state had enacted any law that conferred on educational authorities the power to quarantine children with symptoms outside their family home without their parents\u2019 or guardians\u2019 consent.\u00a0\nAs a result, the \u201cCOVID Act\u201d Facebook post shared widely by users in the United States in August 2020 was not only based on an earlier set of claims that originated in an entirely different jurisdiction (the U.K.), but it also did not inadvertently refer to a different recently enacted law that authorized school officials to quarantine pupils. The post\u2019s claims were false.\nA law that empowers educational authorities to quarantine children outside their home without their parents\u2019 consent does not exist and is also highly unlikely to be passed in the United States. Several decades of federal court precedents have established that parents and children have a constitutionally protected right not to be separated. In 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit wrote that:\n\u201cParents and children have a well-elaborated constitutional right to live together without governmental interference [\u2026]. That right is an essential liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that parents and children will not be separated by the state without due process of law except in an emergency.\u201d\nLike all rights, the right of parents and children to live together is not absolute, and can be curtailed, suspended, or outweighed by competing rights or by a broader public interest.\nFor example, while the law recognizes an individual\u2019s fundamental right to move about as they please, there are circumstances in which state and local officials have the authority to temporarily restrict that right. That includes a quarantine or self-isolation order in which an individual who is known or suspected to have contracted a dangerous and contagious illness \u2014 like COVID-19 \u2014 is legally forced to stay home because of the risk posed to the broader community. State and local authorities can restrict fundamental freedoms in this way on the basis of something called the \u201cstate police powers doctrine,\u201d which we have discussed at greater length elsewhere.\nSimilarly, the right of a parent to live with and raise a child is not absolute. A child also has a fundamental right to be free from physical, sexual, and emotional harm, as well as a right to a basic level of nutrition, shelter, and safety. Where those rights come into conflict, such as in cases where a parent neglects or abuses a child, or is proven incapable of providing care, state authorities can and do intervene to protect the rights of the child, and states can, and sometimes do, involuntarily terminate the parental rights of adults.\nHowever, because parental rights are regarded as fundamental, any law or official action that abridges those rights can be subjected by the courts to what is known as \u201cstrict scrutiny.\u201d Roughly speaking, this means that an especially high standard of justification is required any time the state seeks to curtail a fundamental right, and the state has the burden of proving that its actions or policies are not unconstitutional.\nCarlton Larson, Martin Luther King, Jr. professor of law at the University of California-Davis, told Snopes the type of law described in the Facebook post shown above would be very unlikely to survive that kind of judicial scrutiny:\nSuch laws would restrict the fundamental right of parents to raise their children [\u2026]. To infringe such a right, the government would have to satisfy strict scrutiny, meaning the law must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. Typically, this means if there are less restrictive alternatives available, the government must first use those.\u00a0 Fighting Covid would clearly be a compelling state interest, but this doesn\u2019t seem narrowly tailored.\u00a0 Quarantining at home with parents seems just as safe as quarantining in some government-run facility.\u00a0 So I suspect a court would quickly declare any such law unconstitutional.\nSimilarly, Barbara Bennett Woodhouse, a law professor and director of the Child Rights Project at Emory University, told Snopes that:\nThe U.S. Constitution protects parents from having children removed from parental custody without a showing that the parent is either unfit or poses an imminent danger to the child. The scenario you describe [the conversation presented in the viral Facebook post] is not consistent with any laws, either state or federal, of which I am aware. In the case of a parent suspected of extreme child abuse or endangerment, the authorities might prevent that parent from taking the child home from school, until an investigation and court hearing could establish the facts. In a medical emergency, if a child\u2019s quarantine or hospitalization were deemed necessary, the parent would be involved in any decisions and would have decision-making authority over where and how the child was to be quarantined.", "claim": "Under the \"COVID Act,\" school officials in the U.S. can quarantine children with COVID-19 symptoms outside their family home without their parents' or guardians' consent.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "In September 2018, Nike\u2019s announcement of a commercial deal with free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick prompted fierce debate over the national anthem protests led by Kaepernick, as well as widespread calls for a boycott of Nike products.Kaepernick began to \u201ctake a knee\u201d during the playing of the national anthem in 2016 as a protest against racial injustice and police brutality and was at the forefront of such protests among National Football League players and staff.In the days following the announcement, we received multiple enquiries from readers about a letter purportedly written by the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) which called upon its members to boycott Nike.The letter is authentic and was issued by NAPO president Michael McHale, addressed to Nike CEO Mark Parker. NAPO is a law enforcement union founded in 1978 and described as representing 241,000 officers from more than 1,000 police organizations. The letter, dated 4 September, read as follows:NAPO was joined in critizing Nike and Kaepernick by the National Fraternal Order of Police, whose president, Chuck Canterbury, issued a press release addressing (but not calling for) a boycott of Nike:These vehement criticisms sparked something of a controversy among police unions, with the National Black Police Association (NBPA) issuing a strong rejection of McHale\u2019s letter.

{"evidence": "In January 2020, readers asked us about the accuracy of reports that authorities in Australia had announced their intention to cull (kill) around 10,000 camels due to the pressure the animals were placing on drinking water supplies.\u00a0\nFor example, on Jan. 7, the Weird World Facebook page posted a widely shared meme that contained the following text:\n\u201cMore than 10,000 camels to be killed because they drink too much water.\u00a0Feral camels in South Australia are set to be killed in a bid to stop them drinking too much water as droughts and fires ravage the country. More than 10,000 camels will be shot by professional shooters in helicopters starting Wednesday.\u201d\n\nAlso on Jan. 7, the London Evening Standard published a story with a headline similar to that contained in the meme: \u201cOver 10,000 Australian Camels to Be Shot Because They Drink Too Much Water.\u201d The article reported that:\n\u201cOver 10,000 camels will be shot from helicopters to stop them drinking water in drought ravaged South Australia. Professional shooters will move in on Wednesday, after orders from Aboriginal leaders in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands (AYP). The culling, expected to take about five days, follows complaints from locals about animals looking for any available water source, including tanks and taps in properties.\u201d\nSimilar stories, with similar headlines, were published by the Independent, the Daily Mail, and IndiaTimes.com. Those reports, and the Weird World meme, were broadly accurate, though the specific claim that \u201cmore than\u201d 10,000 camels would be culled as part of the plan appears to have been contradicted by a local official who said the number would be between 5,000 and 10,000. They also failed to mention that a small number of wild horses would be targeted in the kill, as well.\nThe APY local government authority, in the state of South Australia, announced the cull in a Jan. 6 news release that read, in part \u201cThere will be a feral animal kill across the APY lands. Feral animals, but specifically camels, are the primary target \u2026 The cull (kill) will occur the week of 8th January, 2020, when the aerial operations will commence (expected to go over five days).\u201d\nIn a supplementary news release published the following day, APY officials explained the reasoning behind the cull:\nThe region\u2019s first major cull of feral animals is in urgent response to threats posed to communities by an increase in the number of feral camels, and some feral horses, due to drought and extreme heat. Thousands of feral camels are emerging from an arid landscape and moving into communities looking for water, while doing significant damage to infrastructure and housing, and creating serious safety hazards.\u00a0\nTraditional owners, who have been widely consulted about the cull, have reported extremely large groups of camels and other feral animals in and around communities and in specific hot spots across the APY Lands. The APY Executive Board of Management held an urgent meeting on December 11 about the impact of feral animals on communities and pastoral operations, and approved a resolution for an aerial cull of camels and other feral animals across the APY Lands.\u00a0\n\u2026 Richard King, APY\u2019s general manager, said traditional owners recognized the need to manage feral owners, despite a camel cull presenting a spiritual conflict for some indigenous groups, because of serious risks to community safety and damage to important economic, natural and cultural assets. \u201cThere is extreme pressure on remote Aboriginal communities in the APY Lands and their pastoral operations as the camels search for water,\u201d Mr. King said.\u00a0\n\u201cThe dire situation is compounded by dry conditions, animal welfare issues, threats to communities, scarce water supplies, health and environmental impacts, the destruction of country, loss of food supplies and endangerment of travellers on the Stuart Highway and across the APY Lands. Given ongoing dry conditions and the large camel congregations threatening all of the main APY communities and infrastructure, immediate camel control is needed.\u201d\nSeparately, APY\u2019s General Manager Richard King told CBS News that the number of camels being targeted in the cull was between 5,000 and 10,000 \u2014 a range that somewhat contradicts the claim, repeated in several news articles, that \u201cmore than\u201d or \u201cover\u201d 10,000 camels were to be killed. If the number ends up being 10,000, those reports will transpire to be rather accurate. However, according to King, the number could be as low as half of that figure, a detail noted by none of the articles or the meme mentioned above.", "claim": "In January 2020, officials in the state of South Australia announced a plan to cull around 10,000 feral camels in response to concerns over public safety and environmental resources.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}
{"evidence": "During the summer of 2019, remarks by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg prompted a wave of reports, mainly by right-leaning and pro-life websites, that the social network founder had \u201cadmitted\u201d to having banned pro-life advertising in the lead-up to Ireland\u2019s May 2018 referendum on abortion, and even that he had \u201cbragged\u201d and \u201cboasted\u201d about it.\u00a0\nThe conservative PJ Media website published an article with the headline \u201cMark Zuckerberg Brags: We Didn\u2019t Allow Pro-Life Groups to Advertise Before Ireland\u2019s Abortion Vote.\u201d That article cited a tweet posted by pro-life activist Lila Rose, who wrote that Zuckerberg had \u201cblocked pro-life ads ahead of Ireland\u2019s abortion vote\u201d:\nFB CEO @MarkZuckerburg blocked pro-life ads ahead of Ireland\u2019s abortion vote\nFB COO @sherylsandberg donated $2M to Planned Parenthood\nTwitter CEO @Jack banned my & @LiveAction\u2019s pro-life ads, allows @PPFA ads, & says legal protections for preborn babies are \u201cbad for business\u201d pic.twitter.com/ZkrLoY9H2b\n\u2014 Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) July 8, 2019\n\u00a0\nThe pro-life website Life Site News similarly published an article with the headline \u201cFacebook Intentionally Blocked Pro-Life Ads During Irish Abortion Vote, CEO Admits.\u201d The conservative website The Blaze, founded by former Fox News presenter Glenn Beck, also claimed that Zuckerberg had \u201cbragged\u201d\u00a0that his company \u201cblocked pro-life ads ahead of Ireland\u2019s vote,\u201d reporting that: \u201cFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg boasted last month about his company\u2019s decision not to allow pro-life ads from American groups to run in Ireland ahead of the country\u2019s referendum vote on abortion last year.\u201d\nIrish Central, an Irish diaspora news website based in New York, reported that:\n\u201cFacebook deliberately banned pro-life advertisements from the US during the Irish abortion referendum after the Irish government told them they had no laws on the books either way to cover such foreign advertising. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has admitted his company deliberately blocked pro-life ads from American groups seeking to influence the recent abortion referendum in Ireland.\u201d\nEach of these reports significantly distorted and misrepresented what actually happened, by leaving out two crucial facts. Firstly, that Facebook banned all advertising \u2014 both pro-life and pro-choice \u2014 that originated from outside Ireland and had to do with the country\u2019s contentious abortion referendum in May 2018. Secondly, that Facebook continued to host both pro-life and pro-choice advertisements in the lead-up to the referendum, provided they originated within Ireland.\nNone of the articles cited above made any mention of these crucial facts, thereby creating the false impression that Facebook had exclusively targeted pro-life advertising on its platform. Facebook did not do that.\nHowever, the wording of Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks in June 2019 could reasonably create the impression that the catalyst for Facebook\u2019s blanket ban on foreign, abortion-related advertising may have been an influx of pro-life ads, many of them created by U.S. actors, on the Facebook feeds of Irish users, in the early days of the referendum campaign.\u00a0\nOn May 25, 2018, the Irish electorate voted in favor of repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Irish constitution, by a margin of 66.4 percent to 33.6 percent. (Under Ireland\u2019s constitution, any constitutional changes must be ratified by referendum).\u00a0\nAfter the repeal of the Eighth Amendment, Ireland\u2019s parliament was free to pass its own laws on the availability of abortion services, which it duly did in December 2018, legalizing abortion up to 12 weeks, and after that point in cases where a risk exists to the life of a woman, or a serious risk to her health.\u00a0\nThe Eighth Amendment had been passed in 1983, enshrining in Ireland\u2019s constitution the \u201cequal right to life\u201d of \u201cthe unborn\u201d and \u201cthe mother,\u201d and giving constitutional backing to Ireland\u2019s existing and long-standing ban on abortion. However, the inherent tension in the law between the rights to life of the unborn child and its mother created ambiguity and uncertainty in how it should be interpreted, especially in cases where a pregnancy posed a threat to a woman\u2019s life.\nIn 1992, Ireland\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that a threat to the life of a mother, including the risk of suicide, was a legitimate ground for abortion. However, Irish lawmakers did not implement that ruling in legislation until 2013.\u00a0\nAfter five years of activism and debate, and following lengthy consultations involving a parliamentary committee and a \u201ccitizen\u2019s assembly,\u201d in March 2018 the Irish government set the date for a vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment, formally launching the referendum campaign.\u00a0\nIrish election and referendum campaigns are very short in comparison with campaigns in the United States (the second phase of Ireland\u2019s 2018 presidential election lasted only 30 days, for example). As a result, the period between late March and late May 2018 saw a flurry of intense campaigning and debating on both sides of the abortion-referendum campaign, including targeted social media activism and paid advertising on Facebook and Google (including YouTube).\u00a0\nUnlike in the U.S. and other countries, political advertising is banned on radio and television in Ireland, and broadcast media are also governed by strict regulations around fairness and balance in hosting political debates, especially once a campaign has been formally opened.\nSocial media, by contrast, is not governed by any law when it comes to political content, and that gap in Irish regulations prompted concerns about a lack of transparency about the identity, affiliations and funding of those who created various referendum-themed social media pages, posts and paid advertisements. In particular, the role of foreign actors became a cause for concern among some transparency activists and political commentators in the lead-up to the May 25 vote.\u00a0\nAs part of that push for enhanced transparency, on April 25 Facebook expanded its \u201cView Ads\u201d feature (which had been tested in Canada) to Ireland, meaning only authorized advertisers could purchase political and \u201cissue\u201d advertisements. (In order to become authorized to publish political advertisements, individuals must verify their identities and location with Facebook).\nThe expansion of the \u201cView Ads\u201d feature also meant Irish Facebook users who were targeted with an advertisement on a particular page could also see a list of all the other advertisements published by that page, in principle creating further context and transparency around political advertising.\u00a0\nOn May 8, Facebook went further, announcing it had decided not to accept any further advertisements relating to the Eighth Amendment referendum campaign, if those advertisements were being sought by actors based outside Ireland. In a news release, the company wrote:\n\u201cFacebook will no longer be accepting ads related to the forthcoming referendum if they are from advertisers based outside of Ireland. Concerns have been raised about organisations and individuals based outside of Ireland trying to influence the outcome of the referendum on the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Ireland by buying ads on Facebook. This is an issue we have been thinking about for some time. Today, as part of our efforts to help protect the integrity of elections and referendums from undue influence, we will begin rejecting ads related to the referendum if they are being run by advertisers based outside of Ireland.\u201d\nThe announcement made no reference to the viewpoint of those \u201cindividuals based outside of Ireland,\u201d meaning the claim that Facebook targeted or banned pro-life advertisements, in particular, was false. Facebook also continued to allow referendum-related advertisements from authorized advertisers, regardless of their viewpoint on the issue of abortion, but provided Facebook determined they were based inside Ireland.\u00a0\nThe Transparent Referendum Initiative, a crowdsourcing project overseen by volunteer transparency advocates and technology experts, collated a database of referendum-related advertisements that appeared on the Facebook feeds of Irish users during the campaign.\u00a0\nThat database contains multiple examples of pro-life paid advertisements being posted to Facebook after the company announced its crackdown on foreign advertising purchases on May 8. This further disproves any claim that Zuckerberg had either admitted, bragged or boasted that Facebook \u201cdidn\u2019t allow pro-life groups to advertise\u201d before the referendum. Facebook did allow that, but simply barred actors based outside Ireland \u2014 whether pro-life or pro-choice \u2014 from doing the same, after May 8.\nFor its part, Google went a step further than Facebook on May 9, banning any and all referendum-related advertising from YouTube and Google AdWords.\u00a0\nOn June 26, 2019, Zuckerberg appeared at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado and made remarks about how Facebook operates in countries where certain regulations are lacking, particularly around political advertising. The company\u2019s CEO encouraged national governments to pass their own laws regulating political content and advertising, rather than relying on large technology companies such as Facebook to intervene in the interests of transparency. He offered the Eighth Amendment referendum campaign in Ireland as an example:\nThere are other types of laws around the world that I think would be positive as well. For example, we had an issue \u2014 this is not an American example \u2014 but we had an issue in Ireland. In the last year there was a referendum on abortion, and during that election [sic], leading up to that referendum, a bunch of pro-life American groups advertised, leading up to this Irish election [sic], to try to influence public opinion there.\nAnd we went to the Irish and asked folks there, \u2018Well, how do you want us to handle this? You have no laws on the books that are relevant for whether we should be allowing this kind of speech in your election, and really this doesn\u2019t feel like the kind of thing that a private company should be making a decision on.\u2019 And their response at the time was, \u2018We don\u2019t currently have a law, so you need to make whatever decision you want to make.\u2019\nWe ended up not allowing the ads, but at the end of the day, that feels like the kind of thing, around the world in different democracies, that you\u2019d really want the local countries to be deciding for themselves \u2014 what kind of discourse they want and what kind of advertising they want in their elections \u2014 not a private company.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThe first thing to note about Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks is that he is clearly not \u201cbragging\u201d or \u201cboasting\u201d about Facebook\u2019s intervention during the abortion referendum in Ireland. In fact, he expressed reticence on the part of Facebook about having a decisive role in regulating political advertising in the country in that case, and he was using the Eighth Amendment campaign as an example of why it would be better, in his view, for individual national governments to use local statutes, rather than private companies, to regulate that kind of content.\u00a0\nFurthermore, some reports have assumed that in describing consultations between Facebook and \u201cfolks\u201d in Ireland, Zuckerberg was saying that Facebook intervened in the Eighth Amendment campaign after conversations with members of the Irish government, which had proposed the repeal of the constitutional ban on abortion.\u00a0\nIn fact, a spokesperson for Facebook clarified that the company had not had any conversations with members of the Irish government on the issue, but rather consulted with an electoral watchdog called the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO). SIPO is independent of the government of Ireland, and operates on a strictly non-partisan basis. It is responsible for investigating and enforcing laws around political ethics, election spending, donations, and so on.\u00a0\nSo it is false to claim, as some reports did, that Facebook had consulted with the Irish government who, motivated by a desire to see the Eighth Amendment repealed, persuaded Facebook to intervene by specifically targeting pro-life advertisements. \n(After the publication of this fact check, LifeNews.com edited a report which had claimed Zuckerberg told the Aspen Ideas Festival that Facebook \u201casked pro-abortion politicians last year whether it should ban pro-life ads\u201d during the campaign. The amended article subsequently stated that Facebook had put that enquiry to \u201can Irish government agency,\u201d an apparent allusion to SIPO. The article did not include a correction, or an explanation of the source of that detail, since Zuckerberg did not mention any \u201cIrish government agency\u201d in his Aspen remarks).\u00a0\nRather, in April 2018 Facebook raised concerns with SIPO that it may have discovered evidence of a violation of Ireland\u2019s law against foreign donations to political campaigns, in the form of a U.S.-based actor paying Facebook to \u201cboost\u201d a post that had been created by an Irish-based abortion-campaign page.\nThe case was rather complicated, and involved several inter-connected Facebook pages that shared the same administrators, one of whom was Irish and one of whom was American, and in the end SIPO reached no clear conclusion about whether a breach of the law against foreign campaign donations occurred. In email correspondence released under Ireland\u2019s Freedom of Information law, Facebook representatives were scrupulous in not revealing to SIPO the nature or viewpoint of the campaign pages in question.\nSeparately, a spokesperson for Facebook told us that in the first weeks of the campaign, Facebook had become aware of several concerns about foreign actors attempting to influence the campaign, and that one of those concerns related to U.S.-based, pro-life groups paying for advertising on the platform. That concern, the spokesperson told us, partly informed Facebook\u2019s later decision to implement a blanket ban on all foreign referendum-related advertising, but only because of an overarching concern for the integrity of the election, and not because of the views those U.S. groups happened to hold.\u00a0\nIt was to this that Zuckerberg was referring in his Aspen remarks, when he said \u201cleading up to that referendum, a bunch of pro-life American groups advertised \u2026 to try to influence public opinion there.\u201d The prospect of undue influence from foreign actors, who happened to hold pro-life views, was one of the catalysts for the later blanket ban on foreign advertising, rather than their pro-life stance being its target.\u00a0", "claim": "Mark Zuckerberg admitted or bragged that Facebook banned pro-life advertising, in particular, during Ireland's 2018 abortion-referendum campaign.

{"evidence": "Sitting in front of a mock pharmacy and flanked by people in white lab coats, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders on July 24, 2020, that he framed as end-all solutions for Americans who struggle to pay high premium prices for prescription drugs. Of one of the directives, specifically, Trump told a crowd of supporters and reporters at the ceremony:\nUnder this order, the price of insulin for affected patients will come down to just pennies a day \u2014 pennies a day from numbers that you weren\u2019t even able to think about. It\u2019s a massive cost savings.\nNews outlets such as The New York Times and Washington Post described the signing event like it was largely symbolic, since the executive orders are unlikely to take effect this year, if at all (we explain more below).\nMeanwhile, at least two conservative media sources, Ben Shapiro\u2019s Daily Wire and CNSNews \u2014 which claims to balance \u201cliberal bias\u201d in mainstream news with its coverage \u2014 reported on the president\u2019s pledge to slash prescription prices at face value, and highlighted the above-mentioned quote by Trump regarding insulin.\nCNSNews published the story, \u201cTrump Says Executive Order Will Drop the Price of Insulin Down to Pennies a Day,\u201d which mainly quoted the president verbatim, and numerous Snopes readers reached out to us to investigate the claim\u2019s accuracy. Namely, diabetic patients wondered whether they would indeed pay less for insulin syringes or insulin cartridges for their pens or pumps because of the president.\n\nAccording to a Congressional analysis in September 2019, insulin averaged $34.75 per dose in the U.S. \u2014 a total that\u2019s almost 2.5 times higher than the average price in other countries.\nFirst, we\u2019ll lay out what was unequivocally true: Trump issued Executive Order on Access to Affordable Life-saving Medications\u00a0during the July 24, 2020, signing event, and that directive authorized the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make certain changes regarding the cost of EpiPens for Americans with severe allergies and the cost of insulin for those who suffer from diabetes, specifically. It stated:\nThe price of insulin in the United States has risen dramatically over the past decade. \u2026 While Americans with diabetes and severe allergic reactions may have access to affordable insulin and injectable epinephrine through commercial insurance or Federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, many Americans still struggle to purchase these products.\nHere\u2019s some more context: Medicare, the federal program that covers the majority of Americans over age 65 and those with disabilities, offers plans that help diabetic patients cover the cost of some insulin products. Meanwhile, policies for Medicaid, the government-run health insurance system for low-income people, vary state by state \u2014 variances that include whether or not the program covers the cost of diabetic enrollees\u2019 insulin, or to what extent.\nTrump\u2019s directive pertained to \u201cfederally qualified health centers\u201d (FQHC), which are about 1,400 community health care clinics nationwide that treat low-income patients on sliding fee scales and purchase discounted drugs from pharmaceutical companies under an existing federal program, known as 340B. The July 2020 executive order was worded like this:\n\nIn other words, the president\u2019s order requires participants of the 340B Program to offer insulin at greatly reduced prices to patients with no or little insurance coverage, without providing specifics on how or when the change would take effect. Advisory Board, a news site for health care providers, said in a statement: \u201cOnly patients with low incomes; those with high cost-sharing requirements for insulin or epinephrine; those with high, unmet deductibles; and/or those without health insurance would be eligible for the discount.\u201d A\u00a0news release from the HHS said:\nThis will increase access to life-saving insulin and epinephrine for the patients who face especially high costs among the 28 million patients who visit FQHCs every year, over six million of whom are uninsured.\nFor perspective, about 34.2 million Americans had diabetes as of 2018, which represented about 10.5 percent of the population, according to the American Diabetes Association. So, hypothetically, if the same proportion of people had diabetes within the FQHC population of 28 million patients (a total reported by the HHS), then Trump\u2019s executive order could help about 2.9 million people, depending on whether their insurance already covers the treatment.\nSo to recap, in regard to the claim in question, it was true to state Trump signed an executive order in July 2020 that aimed to make it easier for low-income diabetic patients to pay for insulin.\nBut nowhere in the federal document did the presidential administration explain its plan for implementing the change, nor the level to which insulin prices would drop. There was no proof that the order would allow any American to someday pay \u201cpennies a day\u201d on the protein hormone.\nWe should note here: In addition to that previously explained executive order, a separate directive signed by Trump on July 24, 2020, touched on a yet-to-be-finalized initiative by the White House to relax international drug importation rules and added insulin to a list of prescription medications that can be imported from Canada. The president characterized that directive, too, as a positive step for people who want lower insulin costs.\nAnd that brings us to our final point: Much of what Trump celebrated in the July 2020 executive orders had been proposed by his administration prior to the signing ceremony but stalled amid opposition from pharmaceutical companies and political barriers. \u201c[None] of these ideas put forth are new, or in fact any more implementable than before, especially without congressional action,\u201d an investor told FeircePharma, a trade publication for the pharmaceutical industry.\nFor instance, in May 2020, Trump unveiled a plan to cap the cost of insulin for Medicare recipients at $35 per month beginning in 2021 (even that initiative would cost patients more than \u201cpennies a day\u201d). But as of this writing, it was unclear exactly how that directive would roll out, and when or if qualifying seniors with diabetes would notice a price difference. The Washington Post reported on July 24, 2020:\nThe moves [by Trump] are largely symbolic because the orders are unlikely to take effect anytime soon, if they do so at all, because the power to implement drug pricing policy through executive order is limited. Voters will not see an impact before the November elections, and the drug industry is sure to challenge them in court.\nA couple days after the July signing ceremony, for example, Politico reported that representatives of major drug lobbies refused to meet with the president to discuss one of the four executive orders: a non-specific and controversial proposal to link Medicare payments for certain medicines to lower costs that people pay in other countries. After that refusal on industry leaders\u2019 part, investors told MarketWatch that the executive orders were \u201clargely campaign fodder\u201d and \u201ccome without the necessary force to meaningfully change prices in the U.S.\u201d\u00a0\nIn sum, while it was truthful to claim Trump issued an executive order in July 2020 that was intended to lower the price of insulin for some Americans, it was misleading to claim that all diabetic patients would save money as a result of the directive \u2014 the directive only targeted\u00a0 low-income patients who are uninsured or underinsured and seek help from certain federal community health providers. Additionally, it was unclear as of this report when, if at all, that group would actually reap the benefit of the cost savings, and the estimated amount of such was unknown. It would be wrong to state based on available evidence that the executive order alone would drive down prices to \u201cpennies a day.\u201d For those reasons, we rate this claim a \u201cMixture\u201d of truth and falsehoods.", "claim": "U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in July 2020 that will lower the price Americans pay for insulin to \"pennies a day.\"", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "In June 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that the animated children show \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d had been canceled due to its portrayal of puppy police officers:\u00a0\n\n\u201cPaw Patrol\u201d has not been canceled.\nThis rumor started as social media users debated the impact of how police officers were portrayed on television and in movies in light of\u00a0widespread protests against police brutality and racial injustice across the country. That led to long-running shows such as \u201cCops\u201d and \u201cLive PD\u201d getting canceled, and spurred a number of people who worked on TV shows about law enforcement to donate to causes related to the Black Lives Matter movement.\u00a0\nAs protests nationwide gained momentum, some social media users posted tongue-in-cheek messages calling for the cancellation of the animated children\u2019s show. This led to a think piece published in The New York Times that stated \u201cit was only a matter of time before the protests came for \u201cPaw Patrol.\u201d\u00a0\nThe excerpt from the Times story:\n\u201cPaw Patrol\u201d is a children\u2019s cartoon about a squad of canine helpers. It is basically a pretense for placing household pets in a variety of cool trucks. The team includes Marshall, a firefighting Dalmatian; Rubble, a bulldog construction worker; and Chase, a German shepherd who is also a cop. In the world of \u201cPaw Patrol,\u201d Chase is drawn to be a very good boy who barks stuff like \u201cChase is on the case!\u201d and \u201cAll in a police pup\u2019s day!\u201d as he rescues kittens in his tricked-out S.U.V.\nBut last week, when the show\u2019s official Twitter account put out a bland call for \u201cBlack voices to be heard,\u201d commenters came after Chase. \u201cEuthanize the police dog,\u201d they said. \u201cDefund the paw patrol.\u201d \u201cAll dogs go to heaven, except the class traitors in the Paw Patrol.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a joke, but it\u2019s also not. As the protests against racist police violence enter their third week, the charges are mounting against fictional cops, too. Even big-hearted cartoon police dogs \u2014 or maybe especially big-hearted cartoon police dogs \u2014 are on notice. The effort to publicize police brutality also means banishing the good-cop archetype, which reigns on both television and in viral videos of the protests themselves. \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d seems harmless enough, and that\u2019s the point: The movement rests on understanding that cops do plenty of harm.\nShortly after the Times story was published, conservative figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s son Eric and Dana Loesch, sometime spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, said that the \u201crage mob\u201d was making an effort to cancel the show.\nAs far as we can tell, earnest calls to have \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d canceled due to its portrayal of police officers have been few and far between. While the vast majority of the posts calling for the cancellation of \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d were made in jest, they were prompted by a genuine conversation concerning the impact of how police officers are portrayed in television and movies.\nAn old article from the satirical news publication The Onion may have contributed to some confusion over whether or not \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d got canceled. In 2018, The Onion published an article claiming that a \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d writer was defending an episode in which a German shepherd shot a black Lab 18 times in the back.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Nickelodeon, the network that airs \u201cPaw Patrol,\u201d has also released messages in support of the protests. It should also be noted that on June 7, 2020, the show went silent on social media in solidarity, muting its content:\nIn solidarity of #amplifymelanatedvoices we will be muting our content until June 7th to give access for Black voices to be heard so we can continue to listen and further our learning. #amplifyblackvoices pic.twitter.com/NO2KeQjpHM\n\u2014 PAW Patrol (@pawpatrol) June 2, 2020\n", "claim": "The kids' TV show \"Paw Patrol\" was canceled in June 2020 due to its portrayal of police.

Gordon\u2019s team also gave Paradise Adventist new jerseys, shorts, and knee pads to use for the contest, which was a semifinal match in the Northern California Division VI regional tournament.Forest Lake also received permission from the CIF to forego charging admission to the game in favor of donating all tickets sales to help victims of the fire.\u201cI\u2019ve never been so overwhelmed by so many things I would have never thought possible, and this is one of the most amazing things I could ever have thought would happen,\u201d Paradise Adventist head coach Jason Eyer said following the announcement. \u201cYour community is awesome.

But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now: pity,\u201d O\u2019Toole wrote. \u201cHowever bad things are for most other rich democracies, it is hard not to feel sorry for Americans. Most of them did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Yet they are locked down with a malignant narcissist who, instead of protecting his people from Covid-19, has amplified its lethality. The country Trump promised to make great again has never in its history seemed so pitiful.\u201d\nAs of this writing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports there are more than 980,000 known COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and upwards of 55,000 fatalities.", "claim": "The Irish Times newspaper published a column by Fintan O\u2019Toole expressing \"pity\" for the United States over U.S. President Donald Trump's leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}

{"evidence": "On 13 July 2018, MGM Resorts International, the entertainment corporation that owns Mandalay Bay Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, filed federal lawsuits in California and Nevada naming over a thousand victims of the 1 October 2017 Route 91 Harvest Festival concert mass shooting as defendants.The lawsuits do not seek compensation from the victims. Instead, MGM argues that litigation should proceed at the federal level because under the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies (SAFETY) Act, the massacre that killed 58 people and wounded roughly 500 was an act of terror. MGM maintains that by the terms of the SAFETY Act, the security firm hired for the concert, Department of Homeland Security-certified Contemporary Services Corporation, is the liable party and not MGM. Court documents note that the shooting victims named in the suit have either filed or have threatened to file lawsuits.Robert Eglet, a Las Vegas attorney representing multiple shooting victims, blasted the lawsuit, saying it has caused survivors to relive the horror of that night. He also said state court in Nevada is the proper venue for litigation because MGM is incorporated there, and that the blame for the massacre lies not with the security firm hired for the concert grounds, but with lapses at the Mandalay Bay hotel where gunman Stephen Paddock fired down on the crowd from a room on the 32nd floor:A representative for MGM described the lawsuits as procedural, with the goal of bringing litigation resulting from the mass shooting into the federal court system and expediting the process for quicker resolution. In a statement, MGM Resorts spokesperson Debra DeShong said of the lawsuit that:Eglet accused MGM of \u201cjudge shopping\u201d for a favorable courtroom and said some of the lawsuits that have been filed so far are already in federal court: \u201cTo suggest that MGM and Mandalay Bay are doing this in the interest of victims is a big fat lie.

In the worst mass shooting in modern history, he killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more. Paddock took his own life when he was surrounded in his hotel suite by law enforcement. Investigators discovered he had amassed 23 firearms in his suite, barricaded the door leading from a stairwell to his room, and set up cameras so he could spot anyone approaching the suite.The massacre resulted in a slew of conspiracy theories and hoaxes about non-existent second shooters and fantastical plots by a secret globalist cabal.

{"evidence": "A smear piece targeting U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff swept a California businessman and engineer into the mix and, in doing so, potentially endangered his child.\u00a0\nOn Sept. 29, 2019, the right-leaning website The Gateway Pundit posted a story headlined, \u201cEXPLOSIVE REPORT: Rep. Adam Schiff Linked to Prominent Ukrainian Arms Dealer!\u201d The purported \u201carms dealer\u201d in the story is Igor Pasternak, who is neither a prominent arms dealer nor a Ukrainian.\nSoon after the Gateway Pundit story was published, Fox News primetime host Laura Ingraham\u00a0boosted the same narrative on her own widely watched program. Both outlets were lashing out in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry spearheaded by Schiff, a Democrat from California who chairs the House Intelligence Committee.\nTrump is accused of using his office to obtain damaging information on a political rival from the Ukrainian government. Thus both The Gateway Pundit and Ingraham attempted to make the case that Schiff had equally inappropriate dealings with Ukraine. But the story is thin, based entirely on the fact that Pasternak, an engineer and business owner, hosted a fundraiser for Schiff in 2013.\nFox News falsely reported that Pasternak \u201cmoved his corporation into [Schiff\u2019s] California district\u201d and stated without proof that Schiff \u201ccould have\u201d traded political favors for campaign donations.\u00a0\nPasternak\u2019s company, Worldwide Aeros Corp, is based in Montebello, California, and is not in Schiff\u2019s Congressional district (Pasternak\u2019s district is the 38th, represented by Linda Sanchez). Pasternak, who spoke to us by phone, said neither Fox nor The Gateway Pundit reached out to him for his side of the story.\nThe Gateway Pundit story claims Pasternak \u201csold arms in places like Syria\u201d and \u201chas also been connected to [billionaire philanthropist] George Soros.\u201d This is a laughable fantasy, Pasternak said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like stretching of the truth or a misrepresent the facts,\u201d Pasternak told us. \u201cIt just has nothing to do with reality.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also not a new narrative. The same story floated in 2018 on a different website, that time in response to a memo authored by Schiff detailing Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\u00a0\nPasternak did host a fundraiser for Schiff in 2013, but he told us he has donated to multiple politicians, both Democratic and Republican, a statement that can be confirmed by searching his name on the government transparency tool Open Secrets. And he did design some military hardware, including small arms and surveillance equipment, which were used by the Ukrainian military in that country\u2019s conflict with Russian forces.\nBut his company\u2019s main occupation is the manufacture of airships, also known as lighter-than-air aircraft. Furthermore, Pasternak was raised in Ukraine but was born in Kazakhstan. He is also an American citizen. His mother tongue is Russian, he told us. He doesn\u2019t speak Ukrainian.\nPasternak took The Gateway Pundit\u2019s smear against him in stride, joking that the website had publicized \u201cthe best picture of me.\u201d\nBut what attracted his concern was that the story included a collage of images, some of which Pasternak believes were taken from his Facebook account. In that collage were not only pictures of his young son but the boy\u2019s name. The story also contained the family\u2019s home address. The information has been posted by various troll accounts on social media, prompting Pasternak to contact authorities.\n\u201cIt really to me is not a joke,\u201d Pasternak told us. \u201cIf it was just me, then OK, thank you for publicizing my best picture.\u201d\u00a0But Pasternak, who like Soros\u00a0is Jewish, read it in a threatening light, noting the collage contained more images of his child than of him. \u201cThey clearly understand he\u2019s the most vulnerable point for me.\u201d\nSoros, whose foundation donates money to progressive causes, is the frequent target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\nPasternak said he didn\u2019t make any money off the equipment sent to the Ukrainian military and elected to do so after becoming emotionally moved while visiting Maidan square shortly after deadly clashes with protesters and police in 2014. Pasternak said it\u2019s possible he has been the target of disinformation because his pro-Ukraine activities in the face of Ukraine\u2019s conflict with Russia got him on \u201cPutin\u2019s bad list.\u201d\nSince at least 2014, the Russians have harnessed social media in the U.S. to spread disinformation to influence public opinion, a technique they deployed in their 2016 U.S. election-interference operation.\nWe reached out to Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft, asking why the story on his website included the identity and photograph of an uninvolved child, but received no response.\u00a0\nAlthough we normally link to stories we fact check, we chose not to do so in this case because the Pundit story identifies a child and contains his picture and address.", "claim": "U.S. Rep.

{"evidence": "On 11 October 2018, a Crown Court judge handed down a sentence of life imprisonment to Karen White of West Yorkshire, England, who had pleaded guilty to multiple counts of rape, sexual assault, and unlawful (malicious) wounding.The case was unusual, to say the least. As the  reported, White is a transgender female who committed at least one of the rapes years ago when she still identified as a male. Stranger still, she committed the assaults on female inmates after being transferred from a men\u2019s to a women\u2019s jail due to her declared gender change:White was actually accused of perpetrating four sexual assaults on female prisoners, though she only confessed to two, after previously claiming that she suffered from erectile dysfunction and couldn\u2019t have assaulted anyone at all. A report in the  enumerated White\u2019s offenses:The rapes White confessed to occurred in 2003 and 2016. White (then known as Stephen Wood) was placed under arrest in the first instance, an attack on the pregnant wife of a friend, but the case wasn\u2019t prosecuted at the time for reasons that weren\u2019t divulged in the 2018 trial. The second occurrence came to light when police questioned a woman who had returned a letter White wrote to her from jail. She told them White had violently raped her five or six times over the course of a year.Prior to 2003, White had served jail time for indecent exposure and sexual assaults on children. More recently, according to the , she admitted to probation officers that she was still sexually interested in minors and would \u201cthink nothing\u201d of abusing a child.The prosecuting attorneys openly questioned the sincerity of White\u2019s gender change in court. Prosecutor Chris Dunn referred to White as an \u201calleged\u201d transgender female, pointing out that \u201cthere is a smattering of evidence in this case that the defendant\u2019s approach to transition has been less than committed.\u201dAddressing the defendant during sentencing, Judge Christopher Batty said: \u201cYou are a predator and highly manipulative and in my view you are a danger. You represent a significant risk of serious harm to children, to women and to the general public.\u201dIn any case, White will serve out her sentence in a men\u2019s prison. Although the decision to move her to a women\u2019s jail pending trial was rendered in accordance with a 2017 policy update emphasizing the right of prisoners to be treated \u201caccording to the gender in which they identify,\u201d the Prison Service admitted that mistakes were made in White\u2019s case and publicly apologized.Jenny-Anne Bishop, a member of the transgender rights group Transforum, said the local board charged with deciding where prisoners should be incarcerated ought to have taken White\u2019s entire history of criminal offenses into account but didn\u2019t. Moreover, certain procedural steps that could have ensured White was placed in a facility where she wouldn\u2019t pose a risk to herself or others weren\u2019t taken.Despite what happened in White\u2019s case, Bishop defends the system, which is meant to protect transgender people from harm as well as the general prison population, as workable. \u201cIt is almost the exception that proves the rule,\u201d she told the , \u201cyou\u2019ve just got to look at what went wrong and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. No system is perfect.\u201dAccording to a government survey, there are 125 known transgender prisoners in England and Wales, though the Ministry of Justice says the actual number is probably higher.

{"evidence": "As an impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s actions commenced in October 2019, so did partisan invocations of whataboutism \u2014 a logical fallacy that involves \u201ca reversal of accusation, arguing that an opponent is guilty of an offense just as egregious or worse than what the original party was accused of doing, however unconnected the offenses may be.\u201d\nOne example of such was a video clip posted to C-SPAN\u2019s website on Sept. 21, 2019 under the title \u201cJoe Biden Confesses to Bribery.\u201d The video was accompanied by a caption reading \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden confesses to being in charge of Ukraine for the Obama Administration, and withholding $1 billion in loan guarantees from the USA to force Ukraine to fire prosecutor who was looking into the company that Hunter Biden was receiving $83,000+ PER MONTH from\u201d:\nThe user-created clip fostered a false impression by pairing a misleading caption with an excerpt from a much longer video with no context. (The video carries a statement from C-SPAN noting that \u201cThis clip, title, and description were not created by C-SPAN.\u201d)\nPresident Trump has been accused by a whistleblower, and is under a House-led impeachment inquiry, for allegedly attempting to coerce Ukraine into provide damaging information on Trump political rival Joe Biden by withholding crucial military aid from that country. The video on C-SPAN\u2019s website attempted to show Biden, a potential political rival for the presidency in 2020, admitting to a parallel wrongdoing during a trip to Ukraine in 2016:\nAnd I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev. And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn\u2019t.\nSo they said they had \u2014 they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I\u2019m not going to \u2014 or, we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You\u2019re not the president. The president said \u2014 I said, call him. I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\nThe video clip was taken from a portion of a talk Biden gave in January 2018 at a Council on Foreign Relations meeting in Washington, D.C., which was held in conjunction with the publication of the January/February issue of Foreign Affairs magazine. Biden had co-authored an article for that month\u2019s issue with former White House official Michael Carpenter, titled \u201cHow to Stand Up to the Kremlin: Defending Democracy Against Its Enemies.\u201d\nIn the excerpted portion of the clip, Biden was discussing his efforts on behalf of the Obama administration to pressure Ukraine into prosecuting corruption and firing Viktor Shokin, an ineffective prosecutor. That effort by Biden has been used by Trump supporters to argue, inaccurately, that Biden single-handedly had Shokin fired because Shokin was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian group of energy exploration and production companies of which Biden\u2019s son Hunter was a board member.\nHowever, Shokin was not fired for investigating Burisma, but for his failure to pursue corruption investigations \u2014 including investigations connected to Burisma. And Biden wasn\u2019t alone in the effort to push Shokin out, but rather was spearheading the Obama administration\u2019s policy, which represented a consensus among diplomats, officials from various European countries, and the International Monetary Fund that Shokin was an impediment to rooting out corruption in his country, according to Bloomberg:\nShokin became prosecutor general in February 2015. Over the next year, the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund criticized officials for not doing enough to fight corruption in Ukraine \u2026\nThe U.S. plan to push for Shokin\u2019s dismissal didn\u2019t initially come from Biden, but rather filtered up from officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. Embassy personnel had called for U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine to be tied to broader anti-corruption efforts, including Shokin\u2019s dismissal, this person said.\nBiden\u2019s threat to withhold $1 billion [in U.S. loan guarantees] if Ukraine didn\u2019t crack down on corruption reportedly came in March [2016]. That same month, hundreds of Ukrainians demonstrated outside President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s office demanding Shokin\u2019s resignation, and he was dismissed.\nMoreover, among the reasons the U.S. and others sought Shokin\u2019s ouster was his failure to assist with or pursue an investigation of Burisma Holdings\u2019 owner:\nHunter Biden joined [Burisma\u2019s] board in April 2014, two months after U.K. authorities requested information from Ukraine as part of a probe against [Burisma Holdings owner Mykola] Zlochevsky related to money laundering allegations. Zlochevsky had been minister of environmental protection under then-President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in February 2014 after mass protests.\nAfter the U.K. request, Ukrainian prosecutors opened their own case, accusing Zlochevsky of embezzling public funds. Burisma and Zlochevsky have denied the allegations.\nThe case against Zlochevsky and his Burisma Holdings was assigned to Shokin, then a deputy prosecutor. But Shokin and others weren\u2019t pursuing it, according to the internal reports from the Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s office reviewed by Bloomberg.\nIn a December 2014 letter, U.S. officials warned Ukrainian prosecutors of negative consequences for Ukraine over its failure to assist the U.K., which had seized Zlochevsky\u2019s assets, according to the documents.\nShokin took no action to pursue cases against Zlochevsky throughout 2015, said [Vitaliy] Kasko, who was Shokin\u2019s deputy overseeing international cooperation and helping in asset-recovery investigations. Kasko said he had urged Shokin to pursue the investigations.\n\u201cThere was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close cases against Zlochevsky,\u201d Kasko said in an interview. \u201cIt was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say the former vice president\u2019s 2018 commentary at the Council on Foreign Relations meeting was worded well. Before his remarks morphed into \u201cevidence\u201d for claims that Biden ordered Ukraine to fire Shokin for investigating Burisma, they were picked up by Russian government-controlled outlets such as RT and Sputnik to levy accusations that the Obama administration was engaged in heavy-handed meddling in Ukraine\u2019s affairs.\nBiden\u2019s remarks can bee seen in full in the video below:", "claim": "A C-SPAN video shows former Vice President Joe Biden confessing that he \"bribed\" Ukraine to drop the Burisma investigation.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "Some critics of Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded with a measure of ridicule and criticism in the Spring of 2019, after remarks she made about the introduction of the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which imposed a two-term limit on the U.S. presidency.The , for example, wrote:That article was re-published on the website of Fox News, along with the headline \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez alsely claims Republicans amended Constitution to kick FDR out of office.\u201dThe  joined in the criticism, writing:A video clip of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remarks was prominently shared on Twitter by Tom Elliott, who added: \u201cAccording to AOC, Congress amended the Constitution to prevent FDR from being re-elected: \u2018They had to amend the Constitution of the United States to make sure Roosevelt dd not get reelected.\u2019 (Reminder, FDR died in office in 1945; the 22nd Amendment came in 1947).\u201d\u00a0Critics of Ocasio-Cortez pounced on her remarks as evidence of a purported lack of historical knowledge on her part. However, the Congresswoman\u2019s subsequent comments on the subject, along with clarification provided by her spokesperson, indicated the intended meaning of her remarks was that the  behind the development of the two-term limit (which was ultimately enshrined in the 22nd amendment) had been Roosevelt\u2019s repeated re-elections during the 1930s and 1940s, and not that the introduction of the 22nd amendment (as opposed to Roosevelt\u2019s death) prevented what would have been his fourth re-election.The Congresswoman\u2019s remarks came during a web-only question-and-answer session recorded during her appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In\u201d with Chris Hayes on 29 March, whose focus was the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d a plan put forward by Ocasio-Cortez ;and fellow Democrat Senator Ed Markey to tackle climate change and create jobs centered around renewable energy.Mark Paul, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning think tank, asked Ocasio-Cortez what lessons she had learned from the \u201cNew Deal,\u201d the series of economic projects FDR introduced in the 1930s with the intention of helping the U.S. economy to recover from the Great Depression, and the program to which the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d is an allusion.One of the points Ocasio-Cortez made in response to that question was to highlight the importance of Democratic success in facilitating the passage of legislation that introduced New Deal programs. Here\u2019s a (lightly edited) transcript of that segment, which can be viewed below:The point Ocasio-Cortez was making in that section of the interview was to highlight the role that electoral success for Democrats \u2014 not least of which was FDR\u2019s repeated presidential victories during the 1930s and 1940s \u2014 played in facilitating the introduction of major reforms such as the New Deal programs. FDR was first elected in 1932, then re-elected three times, in 1936, 1940, and 1944.To illustrate the extent of FDR\u2019s power and popularity at that time, the Congresswoman said: \u201cThey had to amend the Constitution of the United States to make sure Roosevelt did not get re-elected.\u201dThe manner in which she phrased that statement (\u201cThey had to \u2026 to make sure\u201d) indicated, on its face, that Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0was saying that the introduction of the two-term limit in the 22nd Amendment was  in order to prevent FDR from being re-elected a fourth time.It is therefore understandable that some commentators seized upon her remarks and made the rather obvious point that the 22nd Amendment was not required to prevent FDR\u2019s fourth re-election, because FDR died in 1945, six years before the amendment was ratified and came into effect.(FDR died two years before the U.S. Congress passed the amendment, but it was not  until it was ratified by the requisite number of states six years after his death, contrary to the \u2018s inaccurate statement that he had died \u201ctwo years before presidential term limits were implemented.\u201d)However, that was not the intended meaning of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remarks, according to a spokesperson for the Congresswoman. The spokesperson told us it was \u201cpretty clear\u201d that her intention was simply to point out that FDR\u2019s repeated re-elections, and the sustained implementation of his policy agenda, had been the  for Republican efforts to introduce a term limit on the U.S. presidency, a plan that began while FDR was still alive.That this was Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s intended meaning is also supported by the fact that the Congresswoman approvingly tweeted out a  article\u00a0that presented the \u201cfull story\u201d behind her remarks, which reported that:It is unquestionably true that efforts to introduce a two-term limit on the U.S. presidency began before FDR\u2019s death and were intensified by his unprecedented third and fourth elections in 1940 and 1944.FDR\u2019s decision to break precedent and seek a third term in 1940 was in itself a significant part of Republican candidate Wendell Willkie\u2019s platform that year. In a speech accepting his party\u2019s nomination in August 1940, Willkie said: \u201cI should like to debate the question of the assumption by this President, in seeking a third term, of a greater public confidence than was accorded to our presidential giants, Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson.\u201dIn a newspaper advertisement published days before the election, Republicans put \u201cThe Third Term\u201d at the top of a list of major issues, writing: \u201cViolating all principles of freedom, and a sacred American tradition of 150 years standing, the President forced his own nomination for a third term at the Chicago convention \u2026 and gave as an excuse I was drafted.\u2019 Are we Americans that gullible? \u2026 Let us say together, \u2018There is no indispensible man. There shall be no third term.'\u201d(In order to avoid the controversy of actively seeking to break the two-term tradition, FDR coyly declined to openly declare himself a candidate in 1940, and instead his supporters arranged for him to be \u201cdrafted\u201d as a nominee by delegates at the 1940 Democratic National Convention.)In a statement issued the day before the election, Willkie called specifically for a constitutional amendment to limit the presidency to eight years, saying that \u201cWhen elected, in order to prevent any subsequent demonstrations of such ambitious views, in my first message to Congress I shall recommend that they submit a constitutional amendment limiting the time any one president may serve to eight years or less.\u201dBefore FDR\u2019s third re-election in 1944, his Republican opponent, Thomas Dewey, also called for a term limit of the kind ultimately encapsulated in the 22nd Amendment. In a speech delivered in Buffalo, New York, just days before the election, Dewey said a fourth term for FDR would be \u201cthe most dangerous threat to our freedom ever proposed,\u201d adding, \u201cI believe that two terms must be established as the limit by constitutional amendment.\u201dFDR won his fourth presidential election that year, but he died just five months later, in April 1945, leaving Vice President Harry Truman to serve out nearly all of what would have been his fourth term.After the House of Representatives and Senate switched from Democratic to Republican control in the 1946 mid-term elections, the path was cleared for the 22nd amendment, which was passed by Congress in 1947. It eventually entered the U.S. Constitution in February 1951, when Nevada and Utah became the 35th and 36th U.S. states to ratify it, providing the required approval by three-quarters of the states. (The U.S. comprised only 48 states in 1951, with Alaska and Hawaii joining the Union in 1959.)The 22nd amendment states, in part:What Rep. Ocasio-Cortez said on MSNBC on 29 March was that, \u201cThey had to amend the Constitution of the United States to make sure Roosevelt did not get re-elected.\u201d It is understandable that some of her critics viewed this as her saying that the introduction of the 22nd Amendment was  to prevent FDR\u2019s fourth re-election, an assertion which would make no sense because FDR died in 1945, six years before the amendment entered into force.However, according to clarification provided to Snopes by her spokesperson, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s intended meaning was simply to point out that the  for efforts to amend the U.S. Constitution and impose a two-term limit had been FDR\u2019s repeated re-elections during the 1930s and 1940s. As we have shown, that is certainly true, and calls for such a constitutional amendment began to intensify even before FDR\u2019s second re-election in 1940, almost five years before his death.", "claim": "The U.S. Congress passed the 22nd Amendment in order to \"make sure President Franklin D.

{"evidence": "In November 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about a widely publicized anecdote that claimed a film studio executive in the 1990s once demonstrated such ignorance as to propose casting Julia Roberts as the 19th-century black abolitionist activist Harriet Tubman.\u00a0\nThe claim was made by the screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard, who famously wrote the screenplay for the 2000 film \u201cRemember the Titans\u201d and co-wrote the script for \u201cHarriet,\u201d a 2019 film about the life of Tubman released in late 2019.\nThe \u201cJulia Roberts\u201d proposal was widely reported, with articles and television segments repeating the claim published by TMZ, CNN, WXIA-TV, The Guardian, and Us Weekly. Wendy Williams also devoted a segment of her Nov. 20 talk show to the claims, calling them \u201creally disgusting\u201d:\n\u00a0\u00a0\nWe were unable to verify the accuracy of claims that a Hollywood film executive in the mid-1990s earnestly proposed casting Roberts as Tubman. As such, those claims remain unproven. If information or evidence emerges that definitively corroborates Howard\u2019s claims, we will update this fact check accordingly.\u00a0\nIn an interview with the film distribution company Focus Features, published on Nov. 1, 2019, Howard described the many difficulties he had encountered in getting his screenplay about the life of Tubman produced. He said:\n\u201cHarriet,\u201d which was set up at Disney 26 years ago, was my first assignment. When I got in the business, I wanted to tell these historical stories by turning them into entertainment. I didn\u2019t want to give history lessons. I wanted to turn Harriet Tubman\u2019s life, which I\u2019d studied in college, into an action-adventure movie.\nThe climate in Hollywood, however, was very different back then. I was told how one studio head said in a meeting, \u201cThis script is fantastic. Let\u2019s get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman.\u201d When someone pointed out that Roberts couldn\u2019t be Harriet, the executive responded, \u201cIt was so long ago. No one is going to know the difference.\u201d \nTwo films really changed the climate in Hollywood to allow Harriet to be made. When \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d became a hit and did a couple hundred million dollars worldwide, I told my agent, \u201cYou can\u2019t say this kind of story won\u2019t make money now.\u201d Then \u201cBlack Panther\u201d really blew the doors open. [Emphasis added].\nHoward told a similar story in a Nov. 19 column he wrote for the Los Angeles Times, writing:\nPicture 1994: \u201cThis is a great script. Let\u2019s get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman,\u201d said the then-president of a studio sublabel. Fortunately, there was a single black person in that studio meeting 25 years ago who told him that Harriet Tubman was a black woman. The president replied, \u201cThat was so long ago. No one will know that.\u201d Thus began the epic 25-year journey of getting my Harriet Tubman script to the screen.\nWe put a series of questions to a representative for Howard, asking for any details or additional information that might corroborate his anecdote. We asked for the names of both the studio president in question and the third party who supposedly reported the executive\u2019s suggestion back to Howard (who does not claim to have been in the room), so that we could contact them and ask them about the anecdote.\nWe also asked Howard\u2019s representative whether it was possible that Howard had misinterpreted or misunderstood what the third party told him, or that the third party had misinterpreted or misunderstood what the studio executive had said. Unfortunately, we did not receive a response of any kind.\nWe found no record of any reference to the Roberts/Tubman suggestion in an extensive news archive that covered the period since the early 1990s and beyond, nor in the Internet Archive.\nThe only reference we found that did not come from Howard himself and pre-dated November 2019 was in an October 2018 tweet posted by the young adult novelist Sherri Smith. In response to a report that the white filmmaker and writer Lena Dunham had been asked to write a screen adaptation of a book about a Syrian refugee\u2019s experience, Smith tweeted:\n\u201cReminds me of my favorite development story. When pitched a Harriet Tubman movie, the exec said, \u2018Great, I think we can get Julia Roberts for the lead.'\u201d\nThis is essentially the same anecdote later recounted by Howard in November 2019. Smith told Snopes she might have heard the story when she was an intern in the development department of Columbia Pictures in 1992 or 1993, but she added that it was \u201clikely apocryphal.\u201d\u00a0\nInterestingly, the notion of Roberts playing Tubman has been the subject of multiple jokes on social media in recent years, especially as part of a broader conversation about \u201cwhitewashing\u201d \u2014 the practice of casting white actors to play non-white roles.\u00a0\nWe also contacted the office of Roberts\u2019 publicist, in an effort to discover whether Roberts herself might be able to corroborate Howard\u2019s story. The person who answered the phone declined to allow Snopes to leave a voicemail for the publicist and would not provide an email address, but said, \u201cWe\u2019re not responding at this time\u201d to questions about Howard\u2019s anecdote.\u00a0\u00a0\nHoward did not name any of the individuals involved in his story, and his representative did not respond to our inquiries, meaning we could not contact those individuals directly and ask them to corroborate Howard\u2019s claims.\nWe could find only one previous reference to a movie executive suggesting Roberts for the role of Tubman. That reference did not provide any further details, and the person who posted it on Twitter told Snopes she thought it was probably not true. Finally, the office of Roberts\u2019 publicist declined to comment on anything related to Howard\u2019s anecdote.\u00a0\nWhat he described might have taken place. But, despite our extensive efforts to find corroborating evidence, which included inviting Howard himself to provide further details, we found no evidence to either support or dismiss his claims. As such, those claims remain unproven.

{"evidence": "In late 2019, concerned readers asked us about a series of widely shared Facebook posts that claimed to include photographic evidence of a new tactic being employed by sex traffickers in the state of Florida, and in the city of Tampa, in particular.\u00a0\nThe earliest example of the post that we found was published on Nov. 19. It included three photographs that appeared to show a road at night, with a car pulled over and a person lying on his or her back in the middle of the road. The message read:\n\u201cThis Shit Happened To My Lil Brother Last Night In Tampa, Sex Trafficking Is Real, These People Lay In The Middle Of The Road And Act Like Their Car Broke Down Or Play Hurt For You To Stop. When U Get Out The Car They Attack. If Y\u2019all See Anything Like This, Don\u2019t Hesitate To Run Their Ass Over. If U Scared Then Try Your Best To Go Around, But Whatever You Do, Don\u2019t Get Out Of Your Car, Lock Your Doors And Keep It Moving\u2026.!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d\n\nOver the course of the following days and weeks, the same or similar messages, using the same photographs, were shared hundreds of thousands of times. In some cases, the \u201clying in the road\u201d method was identified as a sex trafficking ruse specific to Tampa, and in other cases specific to the state of Florida. In still other instances, no geographic marker was provided, giving many readers the impression that sex traffickers all across the United States were using the same ruse. In each case, the Facebook post claimed that the photographs were merely one illustration of a broader trend of incidents, and that the purported \u201clying-in-the-road\u201d ruse was a prevalent sex trafficking tactic.\u00a0\nIn reality, we found no evidence to support or corroborate the claim that a pattern of incidents existed, in Tampa, in Florida, or anywhere in the United States, in which sex traffickers attempted to kidnap unsuspecting motorists by tricking them into stopping their cars by lying in the middle of the road. Nor did we find any evidence that the photographs included in the November and December 2019 Facebook posts showed a specific incident of attempted sex trafficking.\u00a0\nA spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (akin to the \u201cstate police\u201d found in other states) told Snopes that the agency \u201chas not heard of this tactic in Tampa or elsewhere.\u201d A spokesperson for the Tampa Police Department told Snopes much the same and emphasized that \u201cNo such incident took place in Tampa.\u201d The spokesperson added, \u201cWe have not heard of this method or tactic being used in our jurisdiction.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Office (the county where Tampa is located) also told Snopes: \u201cNo reports have been filed related to this incident or matching what is described in the post, so we can not confirm if it is related to human trafficking or if it is even real.\u201d\nLaura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told Snopes in a statement that:\n\u201cOur organization is not aware of any reports of human trafficking similar to the one described in these viral social media posts \u2026 Although it may be possible that in isolated incidents human trafficking attempts like this have occurred in the past, it is unlikely that this is a common trend.\u201d\nBoth Theresa Prichard, associate director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, and Kathleen Kempe, senior director of the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, also told Snopes they had never heard of any such sex trafficking tactic.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not clear what the origins of the photographs were. We put a series of questions to the Cornelius King Facebook account above where the trafficking post originated, requesting to speak to his brother, who according to the post was a firsthand witness to the alleged incident shown in the photographs. We asked whether he, his brother, or anyone else had reported the alleged incident to any law enforcement agency, the exact time and location of the incident, and we requested any evidence that might corroborate the claim that the alleged incident was connected to sex trafficking. We received no response.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also unclear whether the photographs were authentic or staged, perhaps as part of a stunt, prank, advertisement, or film of some kind. If they were authentic, it\u2019s not clear what the motives or state of mind were of the person shown lying in the road. The photographs themselves do not contain any elements or features whose presence indicates a connection to sex trafficking, in particular, as opposed to several other explanations.\nSince we have not yet discovered the origins of, and facts surrounding, the photographs, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that they show a specific instance of attempted kidnapping or sex trafficking. However, based on the responses provided by several law enforcement agencies and relevant non-profit organizations, we can say that no broader pattern or trend of incidents exists in Tampa, or Florida, or in the United States, whereby motorists are tricked into stopping their cars by a person lying in the middle of the road, as part of a sex trafficking plot.\u00a0\nAll of the widely shared Facebook posts cited above claimed that the photographs were an illustration of a broader trend.

{"evidence": "In the aftermath of a series of hurricanes in September 2017\u00a0\u2014 particularly Maria, which devastated the United States territory of Puerto Rico\u00a0\u2014 President Donald Trump reflected on the infrastructural damage caused by those storms in a 25 September 2017 tweet:In response, public relations and marketing executive Lainie Green issued a series of tweets that went viral, accusing President Trump of having added to Puerto Rico\u2019s debt by bankrupting a golf course there and defaulting on $33 million worth of government-issued bonds:Green\u2019s account of the episode got some facts right, but it also left out some important context necessary for any assessment of Trump\u2019s responsibility for the bankruptcy of the golf course.According to documents first detailed in a 2016  investigation, in 2008 Trump International entered into an arrangement with the owners of Coco Beach Golf & Country Club, a foundering resort and golf course that had opened in 2004 on the northeast coast of Puerto Rico about 30 miles from San Juan. Under the agreement, the future president\u2019s company licensed the Trump name to the owners and took on a share of the resort\u2019s day-to-day management in exchange for a fee.The owners of the resort, which was renamed Trump International Golf Club Puerto Rico after 2008, had already received significant financial assistance from the Puerto Rican government before Trump\u2019s intervention. In 2000 and 2004, Puerto Rico\u2019s\u00a0Industrial, Tourist, Educational, Medical and Environmental Control Facilities Financing Authority (AFICA) issued the owners of the club a total of $25,497,854 in bonds to help build and launch the resort. In 2009, the Puerto Rican government also invested $50 million in the Hotel Gran Melia, which was part of the resort and provided a crucial stream of customers for the golf club, according to .By October 2011, Coco Beach had defaulted on $26 million in bonds and had to seek another round of financing. In 2015, the company filed for bankruptcy under its original name, Coco Beach Golf and Country Club, citing debts of more than $78 million but only $9 million in assets. Bankruptcy court records show that Puerto Rico\u2019s Tourism Development Fund made a claim of $32,606,821, essentially leaving Puerto Rican taxpayers on the hook for the better part of $33 million.Does all this mean that Trump \u201cbankrupted\u201d the golf course, though? Not exactly.The evidence shows that Coca Beach had consistently been operating at a loss and accumulating debts in the years before Trump International became involved with its management. And a significant portion of the financial assistance provided by the Puerto Rican government was given in 2000 and 2004, well before the future U.S. president\u2019s company arrived on the scene.Puerto Rico had already been hard hit by a recession well before the Trump International contracted to assist with the club\u2019s management, and in the two years before Trump International\u2019s intervention (2006-07), Coco Beach operated at an average annual net loss of $5.3 million, according to . Moreover, neither Donald Trump nor Trump International held an ownership stake in the property, took part in its development, or was involved with its financing; they only operated and managed the resort. Holding Trump to be solely or primarily responsible for the bankruptcy of a business they didn\u2019t own, that was already heavily in debt, and was losing several million dollars a year before Trump arrived on the scene would be something of an unfair standard.However, one could argue that Trump International received a good deal of money from the Coco Beach deal yet failed to turn the club around, or even stanch its financial bleeding. According to the March 2011 bond offering (which was itself required to cover losses on the Puerto Rican government\u2019s 2000 and 2004 bond investments), Trump International had given certain assurances about the future viability of the resort:Whatever that plan was, it did not succeed. The 2012 financials show that the club\u2019s average annual losses rose to $6.3 million during the period that Trump\u2019s company provided management services to the resort (2008-2012), $1 million more per year than the business had been losing before. Further, for this lack of success, Trump International garnered a total of $609,607 in management fees between 2008 and 2012. (This figure is likely the source of Lainie Green\u2019s reference to a \u201c$600,000 paycheck\u201d received by Donald Trump.)Donald Trump did not set Coco Beach Golf and Country Club on course for ruin, but he wasn\u2019t able to save it from that fate. His role in the bankruptcy of the company, which ended up costing Puerto Rican taxpayers $32.6 million, was significant but limited. That $32.6 million loss constituted 0.03 percent of the territory\u2019s total $123 billion debt, which prompted the Puerto Rican government to file for bankruptcy relief in May 2017.", "claim": "Donald Trump \"bankrupted\" a golf course in Puerto Rico, leaving taxpayers there on the hook for $33 million worth of debt.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

The article, which was presented as a \u201cfact check,\u201d got several simple details wrong.\n\nIn response to criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of a recent outbreak of a new coronavirus, the PJ Media article opined that Obama had been lackadaisical about his response to a health emergency back in 2009, and that Trump by comparison had done his job admirably.\nPJ Media writes:\nSurely, St. Barack of Obama would have dealt with this horrible pandemic better than Orange Man Bad, right? No-Drama-Obama had this whole thing under control, of course!\nWell, let\u2019s compare and contrast\u2026\nNow, let\u2019s go to the Wayback Machine. In April of 2009, the H1N1 became a pandemic.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until six months later, October, that then-President Obama declared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic. By that time, the disease had infected millions of Americans and more than 1,000 people had died in the U.S.\nThere are several factual inaccuracies in this excerpt alone. For instance, PJ media writes that H1N1 became a pandemic in April 2009. But that\u2019s not the case. The disease emerged in April but wasn\u2019t declared a pandemic until June.\nThe excerpt also claims that Obama \u201cdeclared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic\u201d in October 2009. But this is also wrong. Obama declared a national emergency, not a public health emergency, in October 2009. The Obama administration declared a public health emergency in April, months before swine flu was declared a pandemic. At the time that the Obama administration declared a public health emergency, only 20 confirmed cases (not over a million) of H1N1 existed in the United States.\nThe New York Times reported on April 26, 2009:\nResponding to what some health officials feared could be the leading edge of a global pandemic emerging from Mexico, American health officials declared a public health emergency on Sunday as 20 cases of swine flu were confirmed in this country, including eight in New York City.\n[\u2026] The emergency declaration in the United States lets the government free more money for antiviral drugs and give some previously unapproved tests and drugs to children. One-quarter of the national stockpile of 50 million courses of antiflu drugs will be released.\nPJ Media also inaccurately presented a video in the article as if it showed Obama addressing the swine flu after it had \u201calready become a pandemic.\u201d Again, that simply isn\u2019t the case. When Obama addressed the nation about swine flu, or H1N1, in April 2009, the disease was just starting to spread. It wouldn\u2019t be until June 2009 that the swine flu would be declared a pandemic.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s Obama\u2019s April 2009 address:\nThe swine flu pandemic spread quickly across the United States starting in April 2009. There were approximately 60 million cases over the course of the following year, which resulted in nearly 275,000 hospitalizations and more than 12,000 deaths.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a detailed timeline of this pandemic on its website. It shows that the CDC first activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) on April 22, 2009. At the time, there were only two confirmed cases in the United States. On April 25, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern, and the following day the Obama administration did the same. At that time, there were about 20 confirmed cases.\u00a0\nDespite the CDC\u2019s efforts, the swine flu continued to spread. Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of health and human services, renewed the emergency declaration on July 24, 2009, and then again on Oct. 1, 2009. On Oct. 24, 2009, Obama declared a national emergency that gave officials more resources to fight the pandemic.\nThe Associated Press reported:\nPresident Barack Obama has declared the swine flu outbreak a national emergency, giving his health chief the power to let hospitals move emergency rooms offsite to speed treatment and protect noninfected patients.\nThe declaration, signed Friday night and announced Saturday, comes with the disease more prevalent than ever in the country and production delays undercutting the government\u2019s initial, optimistic estimates that as many as 120 million doses of the vaccine could be available by mid-October.\n[\u2026]\nOn April 26, the administration declared swine flu a public health emergency, allowing the shipment of roughly 12 million doses of flu-fighting medications from a federal stockpile to states in case they eventually needed them. At the time, there were 20 confirmed cases in the U.S. of people recovering easily. There was no vaccine against swine flu, but the CDC had taken the initial step necessary for producing one.\n\u201cAs a nation, we have prepared at all levels of government, and as individuals and communities, taking unprecedented steps to counter the emerging pandemic,\u201d Obama wrote in Saturday\u2019s declaration.\nIn sum, the PJ Media article claimed that Obama \u201cwaited\u201d until millions of people were infected with H1N1 before he declared an \u201cemergency.\u201d But that isn\u2019t the case. The Obama administration started to address H1N1 just as the disease emerged in April 2009. A public health emergency was declared on April 26, 2009, when there were about 20 confirmed cases in the United States. The Obama administration renewed this declaration twice in the ensuing months before declaring a national emergency in October 2009.\u00a0", "claim": "U.S. President Barack Obama waited until millions were infected and thousands were dead before declaring a public health emergency concerning swine flu, the H1N1 virus.

{"evidence": "Inaccurate messages about the new coronavirus are spreading and mutating online. One frequently copied and pasted bit of text that has gone viral on Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp purports to impart \u201cserious excellent advice\u201d from \u201cJapanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.\u201d\nThat \u201cadvice\u201d asserts regular sips of water can prevent the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, from entering the respiratory system:\nSERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.\u00a0 Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY?\u00a0 Even if the virus gets into your mouth \u2026 drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in tummy \u2026 your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don\u2019t drink enough water more regularly \u2026 the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That\u2019s very dangerous.\nThe \u201cserious excellent advice by Japanese doctors\u201d text is often combined with other viral coronavirus claims including a paragraph about a \u201cself-check\u201d attributed to \u201cTaiwan experts,\u201d and a set of recommendations that begins with a claim about differentiating between a cold and COVID-19. Snopes addressed the \u201cTaiwan experts self-check\u201d claim here\u00a0and addressed the list of tips that begins with a dubious method of distinguishing a cold from COVID-19 here. This article deals only with the claim regarding sipping water every 15 minutes.\nIt is true that COVID-19 infects the respiratory system by directly entering the body through the mouth or nose. This fact is central to both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to wash hands frequently and avoid touching your face. The assertion in this viral \u201cadvice,\u201d however, is that if the virus were already in your mouth, water would help wash it away. Though medical officials recommend drinking water during any infection, no evidence exists to support the notion that sipping water prevents a virus from infecting the respiratory system.\nDrinking more water, while good for your overall health, will not keep anyone from catching the coronavirus, according to Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. Schaffner told The Associated Press, \u201cWe always caution anyone healthy and people who are sick to keep up fluid intake and keep mucus membranes moist.\u201d He also said: \u201cIt makes you feel better; there is no clear indication that it directly protects you against complications.\u201d\nDr. Susan Wootton, an infectious disease expert at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, agreed with that assessment, telling KHOU that no data exist to support the claim that sipping water will prevent infection by transporting it to the stomach.\nBecause no evidence supports the claim, we rank the notion that sipping water regularly prevents COVID-19 infection as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "claim": "Taking a few sips of water every 15 mins will prevent the new coronavirus from entering your windpipe and lungs.

{"evidence": "Wearing a face covering in public during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic is sound advice (and in some circumstances a legal requirement) that could help slow the spread of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But just how effective are these masks? In April 2020, many social media users encountered a simple chart that supposedly showed how effective face masks could be at preventing coronavirus infections:\n\nWe\u2019re skeptical about the accuracy of this chart. It doesn\u2019t appear to have originated with a reputable source; this meme does not specify the type of mask (homemade cloth mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask) used in the chart; and we were unable to find any studies that confirm these specific percentages.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve seen this chart posted by a variety of accounts on several different platforms but have yet to come across any information about who created it. While we\u2019re not certain if this chart was created by an anonymous social media user (social media has been a hotbed of bad medical information during the COVID-19 pandemic) or from a reputable organization, the evidence indicates that it came from the former.\u00a0\nWe were not, for instance, able to find this chart on the CDC website. The CDC even has a page dedicated to \u201cRespiratory Protection Infographics,\u201d but the above-displayed chart is not included on that page. This chart is also absent from the CDC\u2019s page that recommends the use of cloth face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe CDC confirmed to us that it did not create this chart and that the agency could not confirm the accuracy of these statistics. At the moment, a spokesperson told us, there is not enough data to \u201cquantify risk reduction from the use of masks.\u201d\nThe punctuation in this chart may provide a clue about its origins. While the percent sign is commonly placed after the number in English and many other languages, this symbol comes before the number in Turkish. As luck would have it, we found a variation of this chart in Turkish that has been circulating on Facebook since April 10:\n\nIn addition to this chart\u2019s unknown origins, another reason to be skeptical of these numbers is that this social media post does not identify the type of mask being used. Is this chart about homemade cloth masks? Surgical masks? Or the N95 respirator mask? These masks all provide different levels of protection against the spread of disease, with the N95 being the most effective.\u00a0\nThe FDA explains the differences:\nCDC Recommends Cloth Face Coverings for Use by the General Public: The CDC recommends that members of the public use simple cloth face coverings when in a public setting to slow the spread of the virus, since this will help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.\nSurgical Masks:\u00a0\u2026 If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching your mouth and nose. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of your saliva and respiratory secretions to others.\nWhile a surgical mask may be effective in blocking splashes and large-particle droplets, a face mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures. Surgical masks also do not provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants because of the loose fit between the surface of the face mask and your face.\nN95 Respirators: An N95 respirator is a respiratory protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles.\nThe \u2018N95\u2019 designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.\nThe CDC elaborated on the purpose of wearing homemade cloth masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC writes that since many people with coronavirus may be \u201casymptomatic,\u201d meaning that they don\u2019t show any symptoms, wearing a cloth mask can prevent these contagious individuals from unknowingly spreading the disease:\nCDC continues to study the spread and effects of the novel coronavirus across the United States. We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (\u201casymptomatic\u201d) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (\u201cpre-symptomatic\u201d) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity\u2014for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing\u2014even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.\nIt is critical to emphasize that maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus. CDC is additionally advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.\nThe cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.\nWhen we reached out to the CDC, a spokesperson reiterated this point, saying that wearing a mask is a good way of \u201cstrengthening the social distancing that we are already doing.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the CDC told us:\n\u201cAs we study the virus, CDC has learned that a good proportion of individuals who have COVID-19 spread virus before they become symptomatic and a few people never have symptoms at all but are still infected and infectious. That means, that people who are not coughing or sneezing can be a source of infection for others. Something simple like speaking is enough to generate aerosols that can spread the infection to other people.\nA simple cloth mask is a way to contain respiratory secretions right at the source and not put other people at risk. The mask traps the droplets before they spread into the environment. Therefore, \u201cmy mask protects you, and your mask protects me!\u201d It\u2019s a way of strengthening the social distancing that we are already doing.\nThe numbers provided in the above-displayed viral social media post are also suspiciously specific. While there have been studies regarding the efficacy of masks during COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are still learning about how this disease spreads and how to best prevent it. For instance, Live Science noted that two recent studies regarding the efficacy of face masks during this pandemic came to slightly different conclusions.\u00a0\nLive Science writes:\nFor the first time, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that even seemingly healthy people wear masks over their mouths and noses when venturing out of their homes into places where it is difficult to maintain distance from other people. But there is still major debate over how much masks \u2014 particularly the homemade fabric masks that the CDC recommends for the public \u2014 can slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\nResearchers, writing in two new papers, attempt to tackle the efficacy of masks, one more rigorously than the other, and come to differing conclusions. One study examined the effect of masks on seasonal coronaviruses (which cause many cases of the common cold) and found that surgical masks are helpful at reducing how much virus a sick person spreads. The other looked particularly at SARS-CoV-2 and found no effect of either surgical or fabric masks on reducing virus spread, but only had four participants and used a crude measure of viral spread.\nThe bottom line, experts say, is that masks might help keep people with COVID-19 from unknowingly passing along the virus. But the evidence for the efficacy of surgical or homemade masks is limited, and masks aren\u2019t the most important protection against the coronavirus.\nSome experts have also expressed concern that widespread use of homemade cloth masks give people a false sense of security. The White House\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx, said that social distancing is still the most important preventative measure a person can take during this pandemic:\n\u201cThe most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hands,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they\u2019re behind a mask. Because if they\u2019re touching things \u2014 remember your eyes are not in the mask \u2014 so if you\u2019re touching things and then touching your eyes you\u2019re exposing yourself in the same way.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reiterated this point. WHO said in a statement that \u201cmasks alone cannot stop the pandemic:\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMasks alone cannot stop the pandemic. Countries must continue to find, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact. Mask or no mask, there are proven things all of us can do to protect ourselves and others \u2013 keep your distance, clean your hands, cough or sneeze into your elbow, and avoid touching your face.\u201d", "claim": "A chart accurately shows the effectiveness of wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.

{"evidence": "As U.S. President Donald Trump accelerated unsubstantiated attacks on the legitimacy of mail-in voting during the summer of 2020, numerous Snopes readers asked us to investigate whether the leader of the U.S. Postal Service was carrying out a nefarious scheme to help Trump win another presidential term.\nIn late July and early August, various rumors surfaced regarding Louis DeJoy, a North Carolina businessman whom the Postal Service\u2019s governing board selected to run the agency in May 2020. For example, a viral tweet thread alleged:\nMy mailman just confirmed they have all officially been told to \u201cSLOW THE MAIL DOWN,\u201d per trump\u2019s Postmaster General. \u2026He says that there is backed up mail ALL OVER THE FLOOR. He\u2019s never seen anything like it. It has ALREADY begun. But as long as we keep each other informed, we can beat their dirty tricks with INFORMATION.\n\nThe claim\u2019s underlying notions were these: DeJoy was a political ally to the Republican president, and the new postmaster general had used his new authority to order Postal Service carriers and clerks to slow deliveries to help Trump win the 2020 November election. A backlog of ballots in the weeks or days before Election Day, critics of the president worried, could lead to votes going uncounted or deemed invalid due to state laws governing mail-in election deadlines.\nWhat follows is an examination of federal documents obtained by Snopes \u2014 including letters by members of Congress, campaign finance reports, and internal memos to Postal Service employees \u2014 as well as interviews with postal union representatives and a Postal Service spokesperson, to determine the legitimacy of those questions. DeJoy could not be reached for an interview for this report.\u00a0\nNote: Snopes not only investigated DeJoy\u2019s relationship to Trump, but his financial stake in companies that compete with the Postal Service to evaluate if, or to what extent, his past investments provided any evidence of a plan to undermine the Postal Service\u2019s longstanding mission: to provide mail service to every American, no matter their address or income.\nYes. DeJoy, who lives in Greensboro, donated more than $1.2 million to the Trump campaign between August 2016 and February 2020, according to campaign finance reports compiled by the Federal Elections Commission\u00a0(FEC).\nIt\u2019s unclear when or how DeJoy developed a relationship with Trump, and why he decided to support the billionaire\u2019s political pursuits. In a 2005 interview with Greensboro\u2019s local newspaper, DeJoy \u2014 then-CEO of New Breed Logistics, a distribution and warehousing company \u2014 appeared less supportive of Trump, saying his self-important attitude on the reality-TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was destructive.\n\u201cI\u2019d be fired,\u201d DeJoy said, if he was a contestant.\nNonetheless, by early 2017, DeJoy was among his state\u2019s top donors to Trump (see below for The Charlotte Observer\u2019s list that ranks DeJoy at No. 3 with a total contribution of $111,000). And by October of that year, DeJoy had become close enough to the president to host him and other donors for fundraiser at his Greensboro house.\n\nAlso, by that time, DeJoy\u2019s wife, Aldona Wos, had been appointed by the president to serve as vice chair of a White House commission that oversees paid fellowships in federal offices, according to the couple\u2019s foundation website.\nIn addition to his contributions to Trump\u2019s political campaigns specifically, DeJoy has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican causes or campaigns over decades, the FEC records show.\nThe Postal Service\u2019s governing board, a group appointed by the president with confirmation from the Senate, selected DeJoy as Postmaster General on May 6, 2020, after what it described as an extensive nationwide search for qualified candidates. At the time of that decision, Trump had appointed all six board members \u2014 Chairman Robert Duncan, John Barger, Ron Bloom, Roman Martinez IV, Donald Moak, and William Zollars \u2014\u00a0since the early days of his presidency.\nDeJoy, who was in charge of fundraising for the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Charlotte when the board made its announcement, made the following donations since the start of 2020, according to filings from the FEC:\nIn sum, considering DeJoy\u2019s record of donations, as well as evidence of him hosting a Trump fundraiser at his Greensboro home in fall 2017, it is accurate to claim that the new postmaster general is a political ally to the Republican president.\nThe answer to this question is less clear.\nIn summer 2020, the viral claim about DeJoy \u2014 that he had directed carriers to delay mail to benefit Trump\u2019s reelection campaign (which we unpack below) \u2014 took on another layer: that DeJoy had also allegedly invested $70 million of his own money in delivery companies that compete with the Postal Service.\n\nThat allegation, which we deemed mostly true (see the explanation below), was particularly worrisome for critics of Trump and DeJoy, who believed the alleged holdings were more proof of the two leaders conspiring together \u2014 this time in an attempt to privatize the Postal Service.\nHere\u2019s some context before we dive into DeJoy\u2019s personal assets: Conservative Republicans have long pushed to remove government from mail services that they believe should be left to the private commercial market. Since Trump took office, he has called the Postal Service \u201ca joke\u201d or Amazon\u2019s \u201cdelivery boy,\u201d considering its package rates, and has floated the idea of eventually privatizing the agency.\nMeanwhile, others fear dismantling the federally-mandated mail service would disproportionately affect people who live in rural areas, where private companies such as FedEx and UPS either charge higher rates or do no shipments at all.\nAt the same time, the Postal Service \u2014 which does not receive tax dollars for its operating expenses \u2014 faces a worsening financial situation due to a 2006 congressional mandate that required the agency to prepay health care benefits of retirees, as well as a decline in first-class mail customers. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated those long-standing problems, forcing several post offices nationwide to completely close or scale back hours.\nFor instance, on April 9, 2020, roughly one month before DeJoy was selected to lead the Postal Service, then-Postmaster General Megan Brennan said the agency was preparing for a $13 billion revenue shortfall due \u201cdirectly to COVID-19\u201d and an additional $54.3 billion in losses over 10 years. Considering those projections, she said the agency could \u201crun out of cash this fiscal year\u201d \u2014 or the end of September \u2014 without federal intervention. (Brennan announced her retirement in October 2019, after more than 30 years with the agency.)\nThe former Postal Service leader made those comments shortly after federal leaders negotiated a $2.2 trillion COVID-19 economic relief package, called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which, initially, included a $13 billion one-time boost for the mail service. But, purportedly at the urging of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and aides to Trump, congressional leaders removed that provision from the stimulus package, and instead included a $10 billion loan that the Trump administration could leverage in its favor. Then, on July 29, 2020, The Washington Post reported that under DeJoy\u2019s leadership, the postal agency gave Mnuchin\u2019s office\u2019s proprietary information about the Postal Service\u2019s most lucrative private-sector contracts, such as Amazon, FedEx and UPS, in exchange for the loan money.\nBy that time, Congressional leaders and Trump were battling yet again over another emergency relief package; Democrats proposed a $25 billion boost for the Postal Service but then lowered that amount to $10 billion during talks with Republicans.\nOn Aug. 13, 2020, during an interview on Fox Business Network, the president said frankly the tug-and-pull over Postal Service funding was part of his administration\u2019s plan to try to make it harder for the agency to handle the expected surge in mail-in ballots in the November election. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make a deal, that means they don\u2019t get the money,\u201d Trump told host Maria Bartiromo, referring to the false claim that Democrats are are proposing a universal mail-in voting system. \u201cThat means they can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting; they just can\u2019t have it.\u201d\nWhich brings us to DeJoy\u2019s assets, and the above-mentioned claim that he had \u201c$70 million invested in companies that compete with USPS.\u201d For the basis of this analysis, we considered private companies that provide shipping or distribution services, such as DHL, the FedEx Corporation, and United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), business competitors with the post office.\nFor more than 30 years, DeJoy was the CEO of New Breed Logistics, a supply chain business that contracted with a variety of public and private companies, including the Postal Service. In 2014, XPO Logistics acquired DeJoy\u2019s company, and he served on the company\u2019s executive team or board of directors until May 2018. According to internal documents, which we obtained using the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) database of company filings, XPO Logistics considered its competitors to include DHL, FedEx, UPS,\u00a0and J.B. Hunt Transport Services.\u00a0\nAside from that evidence, which proved DeJoy\u2019s former company competed for business with organizations that also competed with the Postal Service, Snopes uncovered a letter from his wife, Wos, to a White House legal advisor on January 3, 2020, that listed her family\u2019s financial assets, known as \u201cAttachment A.\u201d According to that list, the family had stock in companies including UPS, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., and XPO Logistics, Inc.\nShe wrote the letter in response to a nomination by the Trump administration to serve as U.S. ambassador to Canada, and she said she would divest from all holdings in the document within 90 days of her confirmation. However, as of this writing, Wos had not been sworn into the position. The letter, which was available via the Office of Government Ethics, read:\n\nAs of June 15, 2020, the day DeJoy assumed his role as postmaster general, The Washington Post reported the couple had between $30.1 million and $75.3 million in assets in Postal Service competitors or contractors. XPO Logistics represented the vast majority of those investments, and the couple\u2019s combined stake in UPS and trucking company J.B. Hunt, for examples, was roughly $265,000.\nOn DeJoy\u2019s first day, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Charles Schumer of New York, said in letter to the Postal Service\u2019s board of governors\u2019 chairman: \u201c[DeJoy\u2019s] financial interests in companies that have business ties with the Postal Services, as well as his extensive campaign fundraising efforts, raise questions\u201d over his ethical conflicts of interest and partisan interests.\nBy that point, a spokeswoman for DeJoy told journalists he had resigned as finance chair for the Republican National Convention, and would \u201ccomply with any financial divestitures that are required\u201d for the new leadership position.\nIn sum, reports proved the DeJoy family at one point had millions of dollars in assets in companies that compete or contract with the Postal Service, which lend credibility to the viral assertion.\nBut the exact amount of such investments was unclear, and as of this writing, it was unknown if or to what extent the couple had divested any of the financial holdings.\nNot exactly \u2014 but there is some truth to the claim.\nUpon our analysis, the rumor seems to have stemmed from a series of directives DeJoy gave Postal Service employees since he took over the agency. On his first day, for example, he addressed the agency in a video that alluded to impending changes under his leadership that aimed to create a \u201cviable operating model,\u201d though he did not go into specifics.\nThen, in mid-July, he issued several memos to employees, including a \u201cNew [Postmaster General\u2019s] expectations and plan.\u201d Those messages to all managers, clerks, and carriers nationwide appeared to be the source of the claim, and detailed changes to how and when the Postal Agency would deliver mail.\nA July 10, 2020, internal document to managers, which Snopes received from the American Postal Workers Union\u00a0and refers to an \u201coperational pivot\u201d for the agency, said the following, for example:\nThe initial step in our pivot is targeted on transportation and the soaring costs we incur due to late trips and extra trips, which costs the organization somewhere around $200 million in added expenses.\nThe shifts are simple, but they will be challenging, as we seek to change our culture and move away from past practices previously used.\nBut perhaps most relevant to the claim, the DeJoy-sponsored directives included instructions for employees to leave letters or packages at distribution centers if they delayed carriers from their routes \u2014 contradicting previous rules for deliveries \u2014 and said the Postal Service would no longer pay employees overtime to complete all mail deliveries. The July 10, 2020 memo said:\nOne aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that \u2014 temporarily \u2014 we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks [in Processing and Distribution Centers], which is not typical.\nWe will address root causes of these delays and adjust the very next day.\nAny mail left behind must be properly reported, and employees should ensure this action is taken with integrity and accuracy.\nAs we adjust to the ongoing pivot, which will have a number of phases, we know that operations will begin to run more efficiently and that delayed mail volumes will soon shrink significantly.\nWe also considered a separate message to employees in July 2020 that said, under a new initiative, carriers in certain regions would not sort any mail during the morning and instead clock in, retrieve sorted mail from the previous day and limit time in the office as much as possible. Then, when they returned from the streets, they would sort all available mail for the next day.\nThe agency said the extra spending on employees\u2019 overtime or delivery trips had not improved \u201cour performance scores,\u201d without going into detail on what that meant, and framed the changes as necessary steps to improve its financial position. A July 27, 2020, public statement from DeJoy said:\nGiven our current situation, it is critical that the Postal Service take a fresh look at our operations and make necessary adjustments. We are highly focused on our public service mission to provide prompt, reliable, and efficient service to every person and business in this country, and to remain a part of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure.\nDavid Partenheimer, manager of media relations for the Postal Service, told Snopes that the postmaster general was not doing any media interviews regarding the initiatives, nor about the underlying claims of this report. In a roughly 760-word email to us, however, Partenheimer reemphasized what the agency viewed as the need for the adjustments, and said:\n\u201cWe acknowledge that temporary service impacts can occur as we redouble our efforts to conform to the current operating plans, but any such impacts will be monitored and temporary \u2026 and corrected as appropriate.\u201d\nSoon after the directives, American Postal Workers Union President Mark Dimondstein told us in a phone interview that employees and customers across the country were noticing mail delays. In the Philadelphia region, for instance, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported situations where residents were going upwards of three weeks without receiving packages and letters, and postal union leaders and carriers said mail was piling up at offices, unscanned and unsorted.\n\u201cWhen you \u2026 say this is what you have to do as workers, then that\u2019s what we have to do \u2014 [the change] runs counter to everything that the Postal Service is about, which is we treat the mail as our own; we get it to the customer as quickly as we can,\u201d Dimondstein said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never seen mail backed up like this \u2014 it\u2019s not being moved.\u201d\nThat meant, while DeJoy had not told carriers to \u201cslow the mail down\u201d verbatim, he initiated changes to how and when carriers go about doing their job that the Postal Agency said would cause temporary mail delays.\nHowever, it would be inaccurate to assume all slow deliveries under DeJoy\u2019s leadership were a result of the July 2020 directives specifically, when they could also be linked to reduced hours for some post offices or other circumstances.\nRoughly three months before the 2020 presidential election, voting rights groups and outspoken critics to the president believed the new directives by DeJoy occurred at a convenient time for Trump: when a record number of Americans were preparing to vote by mail and avoid potential exposure to the COVID-19 coronavirus by casting ballots at in-person polling places.\nSpecifically, they worried the new requirements for post office carriers and clerks would lead to backlogs of mail-in ballots and thus create challenges for elections officials who, in the majority of states, must invalidate ballots that reach them after Election Day \u2014 even if they were postmarked before that date.\u00a0Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, for example, led colleagues in writing a letter to DeJoy on July 20, 2020, that said:\n\u201cWhile these changes [to mail service] in a normal year would be drastic, in a presidential election year when many states are relying heavily on absentee mail-in ballots, increases in mail delivery timing would impair the ability of ballots to be received and counted in a timely manner \u2014 an unacceptable outcome for a free and fair election.\u201d\nWe asked Dimondstein, APWU president, whether he believed the July directives by Postal Service leadership were somehow linked to a plan to cause mail service chaos before the November election and help Trump win reelection. He said:\nWhat we do know for truth is this administration is, in written record, proposing and planning to sell the post office to private corporations, i.e. privatizing. \u2026That was June 2018. We also know as a fact that \u2026that [there are] calls for reduced service, increased prices, and less workers\u2019 rights and benefits. So if you take those two things together, certainly if they\u2019re implemented, then they\u2019re going to cause delays in mail; they\u2019re going to cause service being undermined. \u2026\nThis is a fact: [DeJoy is] what\u2019s considered a mega-donor of the Trump administration and the Republican party. \u2026\nAnything that undermines the Postal Service\u2019 [service to customers] \u2026 has us concerned that it could be linked back to those who have an agenda to eliminate [the Postal Service]. But I can\u2019t sit here and tell you that that\u2019s a fact.\nPartenheimer said any notion that DeJoy made decisions for the Postal Service under directions from Trump (which include claims that he issued the July 2020 changes that resulted in delays to help Trump\u2019s re-election campaign) were \u201cwholly misplaced and off-base.\u201d\nHe said the Postal Service, typically an apolitical agency, remains committed to \u201cfulfilling our role in the electoral process\u201d in places where politicians allow voters to cast ballots by mail and \u201cto delivering Election Mail in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards.\u201d He elaborated:\n\u201c[Despite] any assertions to the contrary, we are not slowing down Election Mail or any other mail. Instead, we continue to employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling of all Election Mail consistent with our standards.\u201d\nDays later, he said in a statement to news media\u00a0that \u201ccertain deadlines concerning mail-in ballots, may be incompatible with the Postal Service\u2019s delivery standards,\u201d especially if election officials don\u2019t pay more for first-class postage. \u201cTo the extent that states choose to use the mail as part of their elections, they should do so in a manner that realistically reflects how the mail works,\u201d he said.\nThen, on Aug. 18, 2020, DeJoy issued a statement in which he said he would temporarily suspend initiatives \u201cthat have been raised as areas of concern as the nation prepares to hold an election in the midst of a devastating pandemic,\u201d including the controversial July 2020 directives that eliminated overtime and some delivery trips. The statement read:\nTo avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded.\nI want to assure all Americans of the following:\nIn addition, effective Oct. 1, we will engage standby resources in all areas of our operations, including transportation, to satisfy any unforeseen demand.\nIn sum, it was accurate to state that DeJoy, a political ally to Trump, ordered Postal Service workers to leave late-arriving mail at distribution centers for delivery the following day and eliminate extra trips in July 2020 \u2014 a change the Postal Service was expecting to cause temporary mail delays \u2014 although no verifiable evidence proved those directives were part of a deliberate scheme to disenfranchise voters in the November 2020 election.

{"evidence": "The history of the subjugation of darker-skinned peoples by Western Europeans is exemplified not only in the transatlantic slave trade that thrived from the 16th through the 19th centuries, but also in the phenomenon of global colonialism, which lasted even longer.The colonies of Africa were among the last to gain independence from European rule, most not until the mid-20th century. Among them was the Belgian Congo, a Central African territory claimed by Belgium\u2019s King Leopold II for his personal exploitation in 1885. Leopold\u2019s 23-year misrule over his so-called \u201cCongo Free State\u201d was so flagrant that his own government wrested control of it from him in 1908. It would remain a Belgian colony until 1960.Leopold II introduced his countrymen to a colonialist tradition that would come to be known, in retrospect, as \u201chuman zoos.\u201d These were public showings (\u201cethnological exhibitions\u201d was what they were called at the time) of indigenous people plucked from their homelands, shipped across oceans, and put on display \u2014 usually in recreated \u201cnative\u201d habitats, but also, in some cases, literally in cages \u2014 for the edification and amusement of mostly European audiences. They were very popular attractions at international expositions (world\u2019s fairs) during the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, when smaller versions of the same could also be found in museums and traveling shows, in the United States as well as Europe, featuring so-called \u201cprimitive\u201d peoples from many different parts of the world, including the Americas.Leopold mounted such a display on his estate in conjunction with the Brussels International Exposition of 1897. What it was like and what it revealed about the deep racism implicit in the colonialist mindset was captured in a National Public Radio feature in September 2018:Indeed, 61 years later, in 1958, the spectacle would be repeated as if nothing had been learned in the intervening half-century. Among the exhibits seen by visitors to that year\u2019s Brussels World\u2019s Fair (\u201cExpo \u201958\u201d) was a reconstructed Congolese village populated with hundreds of \u201cinhabitants\u201d brought over from Africa.Some contemporaneous press accounts conveyed a sanguine impression of the quaint tableaux of native life presented in the Congo Pavilion. This is how it was described by an American visitor in the 30 May 1958 edition of the :But a disquieting photograph taken at the exhibition reveals a darker side. The image often appears in historical retrospectives of Expo \u201958 and is frequently shared on social media as an example of colonial racism:In the photograph, white exhibition-goers are seen interacting with a black child standing alone in an enclosure marked off by crude fencing. It\u2019s unclear from the grainy image what the precise nature of that interaction was, but the standard description is plausible: Visitors were feeding the child as one might feed an animal in a zoo.The description \u201chuman zoo\u201d is clearly apt in a figurative sense \u2014 the human beings on display were gawked at and to some extent treated like zoo animals, but the exhibition wasn\u2019t billed or promoted as such. The Congolese people who took part in it did so voluntarily and weren\u2019t confined there. That they were free to go is demonstrated in what ultimately became of the Congo village display \u2014 it was abandoned.According to Zana Etambala, a Royal Museum historian interviewed by NPR, the Congolese people who played the roles of villagers in the Congo Pavilion had come to Brussels under the impression that they were participating in a \u201ccultural exchange.\u201d The experience proved to be anything but:An account of the Congo Pavilion in , also from 2018, noted that at a certain point the Congolese packed up and went home:Film footage and photographs of the mock village (including the now-infamous image of white tourists gawking at the Congolese child) were featured in a 60th anniversary retrospective aired by Belgium\u2019s Flemish Radio and Television Broadcasting Organization (VRT). As noted in VRT\u2019s online commentary, Expo \u201958\u2019s colonialist trappings apparently had the unintended consequence of accelerating the Congo\u2019s push for independence.A backlash took place in the Belgian press against the treatment of the Congolese, as noted by historian Gonzague Pluvinage in his 2008 book :As it happened, members of the Congolese intelligentsia also attended the fair as invited guests of the Belgian government. Among them, reportedly, was a political activist named Patrice Lumumba, who, upon returning to Africa, helped found the Congolese National Movement, which immediately pressed for decolonization.\u201cThe fundamental aim of our movement is to free the Congolese people from the colonialist regime and earn them their independence,\u201d Lumumba would say in a December 1958 speech, mere months after the Expo ended. \u201cWe base our action on the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man \u2014 rights guaranteed to each and every citizen of humanity by the United Nations Charter \u2014 and we are of the opinion that the Congo, as a human society, has the right to join the ranks of free peoples.\u201dLed by Lumumba, who would become the nation\u2019s first prime minister, the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared its independence from Belgium on 30 May 1960.", "claim": "A photograph shows an African child on display in a \"human zoo\" at the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, Belgium.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}

Criminal charges have been levied against the four companies that have held the whales captive.Reuters reported that as of June 2019, eight of the ten whales, two orcas and six belogas, had been released.

One was simply an uncropped version of the viral image, and the second pictured this megabat from a different angle:We also found a video of this same flying fox on YouTube:While these images are real, they may also give viewers an unrealistic expectation about the size of megabats. We\u2019ve encountered a few social media posts, for instance, labeling this bat as \u201chuman-sized.\u201dThe flying fox is one of the largest species of bats in the world, with a wingspan growing to nearly 5 1/2 feet. However, the megabat\u2019s actually body length is not comparable to the size of an average adult human.

{"evidence": "Shortly after U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden named Sen. (and former California Attorney General) Kamala Harris as his running mate in August 2020, social media users began circulating a meme purportedly showing two contradictory statements Harris had made about the value of having more police on the streets, along with commentary painting Harris as a \u201clying hypocrite\u201d:\n\nIn a strictly literal sense, the meme correctly attributes to Harris two contrasting statements she made 11 years apart, as The New York Times noted in an August 2020 article about Harris\u2019 viewpoint on police misconduct:\nIn her 2009 book, \u201cSmart on Crime,\u201d she wrote that \u201cif we take a show of hands of those who would like to see more police officers on the street, mine would shoot up,\u201d adding that \u201cvirtually all law-abiding citizens feel safer when they see officers walking a beat.\u201d\nEarlier this summer, in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, she told The New York Times that \u201cit is status-quo thinking to believe that putting more police on the streets creates more safety. That\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just wrong.\u201d\nWhether those contrasting statements document Harris to be a \u201cliar\u201d or a \u201chypocrite\u201d is a thornier question, however. Altering one\u2019s viewpoint about an issue over the course of many years is not necessarily hypocritical, especially if such evolution is based on additional knowledge and experience and/or shifting conditions \u2014 it\u2019s only hypocritical if a given viewpoint is an insincere one, expressed for purposes of political expediency rather than genuine belief. In 2009, Harris was district attorney of San Francisco, but by 2020, she had served a six-year tenure as California\u2019s attorney general and was well into her fourth year as a U.S. senator. Certainly occurrences that took place, and the experience she accumulated, during that 11-year span might have prompted a change in her thinking.\nAs well, it\u2019s important to note the context in which Harris made those statements. The first was taken from her 2009 book \u201cSmart on Crime,\u201d in a chapter that was specifically about the evolution of methods for fighting crime. The chapter was titled \u201cMyth: The tools of crime fighting never change\u201d and opened with the statement that \u201cthe secret of successfully reducing crime is that there is no one secret to successfully reducing crime,\u201d so Harris was arguing against a status quo approach and emphasizing the need for measuring how effectively police were actually making communities safer (rather than merely creating the appearance of safety):\nOn one hand, if we take a show of hands of those who would like to see more police officers on the streets, mine would shoot up. A more visible and strategic police presence is a deterrent to crime, and it has a positive impact on a community. Virtually all law-abiding citizens feel safer when they see officers walking a beat. This is as true in economically poor neighborhoods as in wealthy ones. Police officers are a reassuring sign of a community\u2019s commitment to order, calm, and safety. More beat cops means more rapid response to assaults, traffic crimes, and robberies and has a profound effect on reducing quality-of-life crimes by simple presence.\nBut in addition to putting more police on the street, we have to look at the way officers are being deployed and how we measure whether they are achieving the goal of creating a safer community.\nHer second statement came in the midst of nationwide protests spurred by the police custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020, when long-simmering issues of police violence and the treatment of Blacks by police came to a boil \u2014 all while the U.S. was grappling with a nationwide shutdown due to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. At that point, many Americans decidedly did not hold to the notion that the increased presence of police made them safer (or made them feel safer) and gave rise to \u201cdefund the police\u201d movements. It was in that context that Harris responded to a question about police by asserting that \u201cstatus quo thinking\u201d was wrong and that \u201cwe have to reimagine what public safety looks like\u201d:\nQ: Can I ask you about this idea of defunding the police? What\u2019s your thinking on that idea?\nA: Well, it\u2019s a concept. We do have to reimagine what public safety looks like. And here\u2019s the thing. It is status quo thinking to believe that putting more police on the streets creates more safety. That\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just wrong. You know what creates more safety? Funding public schools, affordable housing, increased homeownership, job skill development, jobs, access to capital for those who want to start small businesses, or who are running small businesses in communities.\nBut, no, we\u2019re not going to get rid of the police. We all have to be practical. But let\u2019s separate out these discussions.\nMany cities in our country spend one-third of their entire budget on policing. With all the responsibilities those cities have, one-third on policing? Put it in the context of the fact that over the last many decades, we have essentially been defunding public schools. If anyone thinks that the way we\u2019re going to cure these problems is by putting more police on the street, they\u2019re wrong.\nIn the period between those statements, The New York Times observed, Harris has \u201cstruggled to reconcile her calls for reform with her record as a prosecutor\u201d \u2014 enduring criticism for not intervening in cases of controversial police shootings and for \u201cyielding to the status quo\u201d rather than pursuing \u201cbold reform,\u201d while \u201cher approach was subtly shifting\u201d nonetheless:\nSince becoming California\u2019s attorney general in 2011, she had largely avoided intervening in cases involving killings by the police. Protesters in Oakland distributed fliers saying: \u201cTell California Attorney General Kamala Harris to prosecute killer cops! It\u2019s her job!\u201d\nThen, amid the national outrage stoked by the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., came pleas for her to investigate a series of police shootings in San Francisco, where she had previously been district attorney. She did not step in. Except in extraordinary circumstances, she said, it was not her job.\nStill, her approach was subtly shifting. During the inaugural address for her second term as attorney general, Ms. Harris said the nation\u2019s police forces faced a \u201ccrisis of confidence.\u201d And by the end of her tenure in 2016, she had proposed a modest expansion of her office\u2019s powers to investigate police misconduct, begun reviews of two municipal police departments and backed a Justice Department investigation in San Francisco.\nCritics saw her taking baby steps when bold reform was needed \u2014 a microcosm of a career in which she developed a reputation for taking cautious, incremental action on criminal justice and, more often than not, yielding to the status quo.\nSo yes, across an 11-year span, Harris did offer the contrasting statements about police displayed above. Whether they\u2019re evidence of hypocrisy on her part or of an authentic shift in her thinking and viewpoint is a subjective issue.", "claim": "A meme documents contradictory statements about the value of enhanced police presence offered by Kamala Harris.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}
{"evidence": "On 10 May 1991, a 14-year-old Boy Scout named David Hahn earned an Atomic Energy merit badge, the first (and likely only) person in the history of Troop 371 in Clinton Township, Michigan, to receive a badge in that discipline:Throughout his childhood, Hahn had been obsessed with chemistry, teaching himself everything he knew from encyclopedias, textbooks, and chemistry sets, while personal safety did not seem to be a concern of his. According to a 1998  profile of Hahn written by Ken Silverstein, \u201cHe once appeared at a scout meeting with a bright orange face caused by an overdose of canthaxanthin, which he was taking to test methods of artificial tanning.\u201d In another instance, he was held responsible for a blowing a large hole in the wall of a Boy Scout tent after accidentally igniting a stockpile of powdered magnesium he had brought along. His \u201claboratory\u201d was eventually moved to the potting shed behind his mother\u2019s house, after an incident in his father\u2019s basement that did not go as planned:After achieving the rank of Eagle Scout, Hahn decided he wanted to experiment with real radioactivity, not merely the models he had used to earn his badge. He created various radioactive devices, including two different \u201cneutron guns\u201d that emitted radioactive particles, and eventually decided he wanted to create a \u201cbreeder reactor\u201d \u2014 an energy generating nuclear reactor that actually  more fissile material than it consumes (by essentially turning material around it radioactive). The concept was popular in the 1970s but for the most part has been abandoned thanks to modern technology and geologic finds that make mining uranium more cost-efficient. The breeder reactor concept was described by the Department of Energy in 1971 as follows:The obvious question is how would an adolescent working out of his mother\u2019s potting shed acquire fissile material to play around with? This is where Hahn\u2019s myopic focus and determination really shined: Many household products (and even more in the 1990s) contain radioactive material, but the problem is scale. Hahn exploited several commonly found products and used his knowledge of chemistry to extract and concentrate it to create radioactivity at levels \u201cnot found in nature.\u201dEarly on, one common source of Hahn\u2019s radioactive material came from household smoke detectors, which contain extremely small amounts of the radioactive isotope americium-241 as part of the mechanism that detects smoke. He \u201ccontacted smoke-detector companies and claimed that he needed a large number of the devices for a school project.\u201dTo obtain the radioactive isotope thorium-232, Hahn recalled a fact he had learned as an Eagle Scout: that the mantle of gas lanterns contains traces of the radioactive material. So he purchased \u201cthousands of lantern mantles from surplus stores and, using the blowtorch, reduced them into a pile of ash.\u201d This method produced radiation levels \u201c9,000 times the level found in nature and 170 times the level that requires [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] licensing.\u201dRadium-226, he learned, was found in the paint of antique luminescent clocks. Hahn was able to find an antique can of the mildly radioactive paint in a clock at a nearby antique store, which he used to isolate the isotope for experiments. Tritium, he found, was used as a component of glow-in-the-dark gun and bow sights, which he repeatedly purchased and returned as part of a scheme to collect the material. Hahn \u201cremoved the tritium contained in a waxy substance inside the sights, and then, using a variety of pseudonyms, returned the sights to the store or manufacturer for repair\u2014each time collecting another tiny quantity of tritium.\u201dThese purchases were not the only instances in which Hahn employed subterfuge to obtain radioactive material. Claiming to be a professor, he once wrote to a Czechoslovakian firm that sells uranium to commercial and university buyers, obtaining a few samples of material which contained uranium-235 and uranium-238. \u201cIgnoring any thought of safety,\u201d as  described it, he attempted to build a reactor using the radioactive material he had collected over the years, using a schematic in his father\u2019s college chemistry textbook as his guide:While he never achieved the critical mass necessary for a self-sustaining reaction, Hahn certainly appeared to have accomplished the creation of some new fissile material:All of these events took place before the end of 1994, and perhaps they would have remained a secret to this day if Hahn had not stashed the remains of his nuclear reactor in that Pontiac. On 31 August 1994, police responded to complaints that Hahn was in a residential neighborhood \u201cstealing tires from a car.\u201d In their discussion with Hahn, the police ended up performing a search of the car and found:The discovery of the radioactive contents of Hahn\u2019s trunk \u201cautomatically triggered the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan, and state officials soon were embroiled in tense phone consultations with the DOE, EPA, FBI, and NRC.\u201d After examining his mother\u2019s property (which she had cleansed of the most radioactive material in advance of law enforcement searches of the property for fear she would lose her home), authorities decided that the site was to be an EPA clean-up operation:Hahn fell into a deep depression following this episode, according to , which was likely exacerbated by his mother\u2019s suicide in 1996. He enlisted in the armed forces and spent four years in the U.S. Navy followed by some time in the Marines Corps before returning to his home state of Michigan. In 2007 the FBI investigated claims that Hahn was storing radioactive material in his apartment. In an interview with the FBI, Hahn described his honorable discharge from the military and his struggles with paranoid schizophrenia in the years following his return home:Hahn ran into trouble with the law for stealing smoke detectors in 2007 as well, and he experienced repeated drug-related incidents in the years following. He died on 27 September 2016 at the age of 39, a death which was the result of alcohol poisoning, his father said:Hahn\u2019s story first came to public light in the 1998  profile written by Ken Silverstein. Silverstein later expanded that piece into the book \u00a0which was in turn optioned for a feature film in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my son and I\u2019m very sad that he\u2019s gone,\u201d Kenneth Hahn told  in March 2017. \u201cHe could have done a lot more in this world.\u201d", "claim": "In 1994, a 17-year-old Eagle Scout built a nuclear reactor in his mother\u2019s backyard, an act that ultimately necessitated a Superfund cleanup.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}
{"evidence": "Misinformation spread on the internet in the wake of a rally in Portland, Oregon, where far-right protesters clashed with counter-demonstrators \u2014 violence that has become a reoccurring feature of the political landscape in the Pacific Northwest.\nThe far-right groups, Patriot Prayer and \u201cHim Too,\u201d held demonstrations on June 29, 2019, in downtown Portland and were met by counter-protesters, including black-clad anti-fascists. As they have in the past, the events devolved into a series of street brawls. Three people were arrested and eight people were injured, including three who were sent to the hospital, according to police.\nRight-leaning social media personalities and websites widely circulated an image of a bearded man with blood covering his face, identifying him as John Blum and reporting that Blum was the victim of a brutal attack by \u201cantifa criminals.\u201d Partisan media and a single picture didn\u2019t tell the full story, though.\nWATCH: Elderly Man Beaten With Crowbar, Another Has Head Split Open By Antifa While Trying To Help \u2018Gay Man In Sundress\u2019 https://t.co/slRy6Nzajm\n\u2014 The Daily Wire (@realDailyWire) July 1, 2019\n\nBlum was hit in the head by a black-clad protester, and that injury caused bleeding.

John told us that in the chaos that has periodically roiled Portland since the election of President Donald Trump, some people show up specifically to fight, and the late-June protests were no different. Blum had swung his baton at people before getting hit over the head himself.\n\u201cIt was just really chaotic,\u201d John told us. \u201cThere was a point where things had calmed down, and then someone threw one more punch, and it turned into another little scuffle. That\u2019s when the older gentleman (Blum) came at people who weren\u2019t attacking him, I think two different people in the black bloc. Someone responded by hitting him in the head [from behind].\u201d\nJohn, who identifies himself as an independent media worker sympathetic to the anti-fascists\u2019 cause, said that a sundress-wearing protester was attacked, but Blum was not part of that altercation. \u201cIt\u2019s really kind of nuanced and mixed up. The idea that John Blum was sticking up for this guy [in a sundress] is inaccurate, but there was an attempted attack on [the person in the sundress]. John Blum was not part of that confrontation.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThe idea that he\u2019s some senior-citizen guy \u2014 yeah he\u2019s obviously older, but that guy got around. He had no problem getting down. He didn\u2019t look like he was super-fit, but he definitely had no problem trying to take on younger people.\u201d\nThe Twitter account that originally shared a video purporting to show Blum being beaten has been suspended by the platform, though we are unsure why. We were also unable to locate Blum online for comment.\u00a0\nThe misleading victim framework that spread across the right-leaning media ecosystem is no surprise, said Stanislav Vysotsky, an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater who has been researching political violence in Portland. Citing the work of sociologist Mitch Berbrier, Vysotsky told us the \u201cvictim\u201d narrative is an established framing technique used on the far right.\n\u201cThere is already a master narrative on the far right that they are victims, victims of people of color, of Jewish conspiracies, feminists, all these things, so it\u2019s very easy once you have this framework to paint yourself as a victim of left-wing thugs,\u201d he told us.\nReality is more complicated, however. He places the most significant starting point for political violence in Portland with a June 4, 2017, \u201cfree speech\u201d rally planned by right-wing Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson one week after two men were fatally stabbed on a Portland train by a white supremacist. The men had been trying to intervene as that white supremacist, identified as Jeremy Christian, berated two Muslim passengers. The rally was scheduled despite the revelation that Christian had attended a Patriot Prayer event, raising tensions.\nSince then, multiple incidents have contributed to an overall escalation of violence at various events staged by far-right activists, which draw opposition from counter-demonstrators, including anti-fascists. On May 1, 2019, members of the Patriot Prayer group showed up at Cider Riot, a bar in Portland known to have left-leaning activists as patrons, and sprayed customers with mace, initiating a street fight. One member of Gibson\u2019s group hit a woman with a baton, fracturing a vertebrae, according a lawsuit filed by the bar.\nAlso in 2017, Vysotsky said, the far-right adopted a new tactic of holding political events in liberal strongholds like Seattle and Portland to deliberately provoke a response. \u201cThat was a shift in the politics of the far right, and this influence of the alt-right and the trolling culture. The protests became increasingly trolling events, where they are coming into the liberal territory basically saying, \u2018We\u2019re far right, and we\u2019re coming into your city, what are you gonna do about it?'\u201d\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, \u201cBoth Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys espouse virulently anti-Muslim views, are vocally pro-Trump, and are known for their deliberate provocations of left-leaning West Coast communities.\u201d", "claim": "An \"elderly man\" was beaten while trying to protect a sundress-wearing man from being attacked.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

{"evidence": "Nike\u2019s announcement of a commercial deal with free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick prompted intense debate and controversy in the fall of 2018, given that Kaepernick is one of the leaders of the national anthem demonstrations conducted by National Football League players who seek to protest against racial injustice and police brutality.Nike\u2019s association with what is widely perceived as a progressive movement prompted renewed scrutiny of the sportswear giant\u2019s ethical track record, including allegations about the low pay and poor working conditions of Nike factory workers in Asia.In September 2018, as mid-term Congressional elections drew closer, attention turned to the political donations made by Nike and its employees after the publication of a report by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, which operates the OpenSecrets.org web site:That report formed the basis of subsequent articles by Yahoo! Sports and The Root, the latter of which carried the headline \u201cNike donates millions to Republicans while making billions from Kaepernick endorsement.\u201dTaken as a whole, Nike\u2019s political action committee (Nike Inc. Federal PAC), as well as individuals listed as employees of Nike, contributed $547,107 in campaign donations during the 2017-18 election cycle, up through 31 August 2018.Of that total, 78 percent ($424,600) went to Republicans and 22 percent ($122,449) went to Democrats. On this basis, the Center for Responsive Politics wrote that \u201cNike gave 78 percent of political contributions to Republicans this cycle.\u201dIf you take \u201cNike\u201d to constitute Nike Incorporated, the company itself, then this isn\u2019t accurate. Those donations came not from the company, but rather from its political action committee and individuals listed as employees, the latter of whom\u00a0\u2014 like employees of any company \u2014 are constitutionally entitled to make whatever political donations they wish.However, this is not a mere error on the part of the Center for Responsive Politics, but rather part of their broader policy on how to categorize campaign contributions associated with particular industries and businesses.In an explanation of their methodology, the Center for Responsive Politics stated that \u201cThe organizations themselves did not donate, rather the money came from the organizations\u2019 PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals\u2019 immediate families.\u201dThe Center for Responsive Politics explains this broad categorization in another section of their web site:So, the Center for Responsive Politics has a note elsewhere on their web site which makes it clear that when they say \u201cNike gave 78 percent of political contributions to Republicans this cycle,\u201d they actually mean, in effect: \u201cNike\u2019s political action committee and company employees gave 78 percent of political contributions to Republicans this cycle.\u201d And the group has explained its reasons for this categorization.However, the nature of this re-definition, and the nuances involved in it, were not as clearly outlined in some news articles as they were by the Center for Responsive Politics itself.Furthermore, the inclusion of contributions by Phil Knight, the billionaire co-founder of Nike and a prolific Republican donor, significantly skewed the partisan breakdown of campaign donations by individuals who listed their employer as Nike.According to Federal Election Commission records, during the 2017-18 federal election cycle Knight contributed exclusively to Republican campaign committees and candidates, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan (before his decision not to seek re-election), Oregon Congressman Greg Walden, and Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, contributions made by Knight and his wife Penelope made up almost half the total donations from Nike employees and the Nike PAC.It is arguable that Knight and his wife\u2019s donations should not be included at all, on the grounds that Knight is not a Nike employee. In a statement, a company spokesperson confirmed to us that Knight had retired as a Nike employee in 2006, adding: \u201cContributions from the Nike PAC are entirely separate from personal contributions made by individuals, including Mr. Knight.\u201dKnight is listed as an employee of Nike in Federal Election Commission records, but he no longer has an active role in the company, serving instead as a non-voting Chairman Emeritus of Nike\u2019s Board of Directors. It\u2019s not clear why Knight still listed Nike as his employer in 2017 and 2018.As for the company\u2019s political action committee (as opposed to Nike\u2019s employees), its contributions were much more evenly split between the two main parties. In a statement, a Nike spokesperson told us:According to our own analysis of Federal Election Commission data (as of 26 September 2018), the Nike Inc. Federal PAC had donated $79,500 to the campaign committees of Democratic candidates and $64,000 to the campaign committees of Republicans, a ratio similar to that claimed by Nike itself.However, when we add the donations made by Nike\u2019s PAC to other political action committees as well as to campaign committees, the ratio flips, with Nike\u2019s PAC donating $104,000 to Republican PACs and candidates and $96,500 to Democratic PACs and candidates.Either way, the partisan split in federal campaign donations by Nike\u2019s PAC has been fairly close to 50/50 during the 2018 election cycle.It\u2019s true that during the 2018 federal election cycle, donors who listed Nike as their employer did contribute vastly more to Republican candidates than to Democrats. However, that does not mean that Nike, as a company, made these contributions.Furthermore, these figures are significantly skewed by the inclusion of donations made by the company\u2019s co-founder Phil Knight, who is no longer an employee of Nike.Finally, Nike\u2019s political action committee, as opposed to the company\u2019s individual employees, spent roughly the same on Democratic and Republican candidates, up to August 2018.", "claim": "Nike donated three times more to Republicans than Democrats during the 2018 federal election cycle, up to August 2018.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "Officials in Jefferson County, Georgia, faced allegations of racially-motivated voter suppression in October 2018 in response to an incident in which a voter registration group was ordered to return a group of African-American seniors to a county-run senior center, after those seniors boarded a bus to cast ballots during early voting for the November elections.The liberal web site ThinkProgress reported of the incident that:In a Facebook video about the incident, which took place on 15 October, the group\u2019s co-founders LaTosha Brown and Cliff Albright characterized the county\u2019s decision as racially-motivated voter suppression, with Albright saying:Jefferson County Democrats Chair Diane Evans was on the bus in question and helped organize the visit to the senior center in the first place, as revealed in email correspondence published by Augusta television station WJBF.Furthermore, Brett said he had not \u201cvetted\u201d Black Voters Matter, and that allowing the senior citizens to leave with an unfamiliar outside group could have been a \u201cliability\u201d for the county, which operates the senior center in Louisville and also organizes its own chartered buses for seniors to get to polling stations.In a statement sent to us, Brett wrote:In an email, Albright rejected Brett\u2019s \u201cliability\u201d argument, calling it \u201cpaternalistic\u201d and pointing out that the Louisville senior center is an activities center, not a residential center:We asked Brett what the legal basis was for his order (carried out by staff at the senior center) not to \u201callow\u201d the seniors to travel to the polling station with Black Voters Matter and requested that he clarify Jefferson County\u2019s legal authority and liabilities relating to people who use the senior center. We did not receive a response to those questions.Albright told us that staff at the senior center had given advance permission for Black Voters Matter to visit the center and hold an event there, but not for them to escort seniors to polling stations. However, he maintained this was because the group had not initially planned to take the bus trip, which he said the seniors themselves had asked for, spontaneously:Albright also questioned the sincerity of Brett\u2019s invocation of county policy on \u201cpolitical activities,\u201d pointing out that Jody Hice, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives, is scheduled to host an event at the senior center on 27 October. (Albright emphasized that he thought the event in question was very worthy and should be allowed to take place at the center, but he saw it as an example of a double standard.)In fact, on the same day that the seniors were prevented from travelling with Black Voters Matter to a polling station, the Jefferson County Board of Commissioners actually promoted Congressman Hice\u2019s event at the senior center on their Facebook page, in a post that was taken word-for-word from Hice\u2019s earlier press release:We asked Brett to explain why the county had forbidden an event in which a bus carrying a local Democratic party official \u2014 but no elected politician or candidate \u2014 was to escort seniors to a polling station  the center itself, but allowed a sitting Republican Congressman, who is actively campaigning for re-election, to host an event  the center itself. We also asked why the Board of Commissioners had promoted that event. We did not receive a response to those questions.In a separate Facebook post, the Board of Commissioners explained that the bus trip had been forbidden because it \u201cwas led by the President of the Jefferson County Democratic Party [Diane Evans] and as such was considered a political event.\u201d However, the Black Voters Matter\u2019s visit had been organized with the assistance of Evans, and yet it was still allowed to take place.We asked Brett why the Black Voters Matter visit was allowed to go ahead despite the involvement of Evans, but the bus trip was not, and asked whether he had considered requesting that Evans disembark the bus (given that her involvement was purportedly the source of the county\u2019s objections) rather than ordering the seniors to return to the center. Again, we did not receive a response to these questions.It is true that on 15 October 2018, staff at the Jefferson County senior center in Louisville enacted the instructions of County Administrator Adam Brett by insisting that a group of seniors return to the center after they voluntarily boarded a bus operated on behalf of Black Voters Matter, a voter registration group.The leaders of that group characterized the incident as racially-motivated voter suppression, but Brett insisted otherwise, stating that the reasons for his order were twofold: the involvement of Jefferson County Democrats Chair Diane Evans meant that the bus trip constituted \u201cpolitical activity,\u201d something the county could not allow, and county officials had not vetted Black Voters Matter or the bus operator, creating a potential liability for the county which Brett was unwilling to assume.However, it must be acknowledged that significant problems exist with the coherence of the twofold rationale outlined by Brett. First, it is not clear that Jefferson County actually has any legal liability for anything that happens to those who use the center once they have left the center. Likewise, it\u2019s not clear that Brett had any legal authority to \u201cnot allow\u201d seniors to travel to the polling station or Black Voters Matter to escort them there.Second, the consistency with which Jefferson County enforces their prohibition on \u201cpolitical activities\u201d at the senior center is questionable. On the one hand, Brett forbade the bus trip to the polling station on this basis due to the involvement of a local Democratic official, even though the bus trip would have taken the seniors  from the senior center, and even though the county allowed a visit to the senior center which had been organized with the help of that same Democratic official.But Jefferson County\u2019s Board of Commissioners also sanctioned a forthcoming event to be hosted by Jody Hice, a sitting Republican Congressman and active election candidate, which is scheduled to take place in the center itself, and the Board of Commissioners has promoted that event on Facebook in a post taken word-for-word from Hice\u2019s earlier press release.", "claim": "On 15 October 2018, Jefferson County officials stopped a bus filled with seniors from a county-run senior center from going to vote.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}

Inspectors made the discovery on Saturday following a routine test. E. coli can cause infections that result in nausea, vomiting, headache, mild fever, severe stomach cramps, and watery or bloody diarrhea. Though many recover from E.coli infections on their own, some infections result in hospitalizations. This advisory affects 20,900 households, or around 25,700 people.\u201dElements of the blog post were plagiarized from a 2 April article on the \u201cMTL Blog\u201d website, which notified readers about a genuine boil-water notice that affected only part of the city of Montreal and not the entire country of Canada. That advisory was based on the detection of the E.coli bacterium in part of the water supply, but the issue was resolved after four days.The \u201cCanada Eh?\u201d website published an almost identical blog post on 2 April which also plagiarized from MTL Blog\u2019s report about Montreal, but on that occasion falsely claimed that the city of Toronto had been placed under a water notice due to the discovery of E.coli in their water supply.\u201cCanada Eh?\u201d appears to have a pattern of periodically re-purposing and re-publishing the template of an article about an E.coli-related boil-water notice in an effort to garner shares on social media.A boil-water notice is a type of drinking water advisory issued by governments when tests have shown that the water supply in a specific area contains disease-carrying viruses or bacteria, such as E.coli (Escherichia coli), which can cause food poisoning.According to Indigenous Services Canada, the national government department with responsibility for water advisories, consumers under a boil-water notice are advised to boil their tap water for at least one minute before drinking it or using it to cook, wash food, brush their teeth, or prepare infant formula.Indigenous Services Canada keeps a frequently updated tracker of any localized, short-term water advisories across the country. According to that data, there was no nationwide, short-term boil water notice in effect on 17 May 2019 or in mid-April, at the time \u201cCanada Eh?\u201d published their article.According to a similar official tracker of  drinking water advisories, there was also no nationwide long-term boil water notice in effect on 17 May 2019, or at the time \u201cCanada Eh?\u201d published their report on 16 April.As such, the article\u2019s core claim is false and appears to be no more than a cynical effort to manipulate the public\u2019s concern about water safety in order to gain shares on social media.

{"evidence": "During the Democratic presidential debates on June 27, 2019, U.S. senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) got into a heated discussion about race with fellow 2020 candidate and former vice president Joe Biden.\nHarris confronted Biden over remarks he had made about having \u201ccivil\u201d working relationships with segregationist lawmakers James O. Eastland and Hermand Talmadge. \u201cIt was hurtful,\u201d said Harris, who is the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, \u201cto hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and careers on the segregation of race in this country.\u201d\nHarris continued by criticizing Biden for working with those lawmakers \u201cto oppose busing\u201d to desegregate schools. She then segued into a personal story about being a \u201clittle girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools. And she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me\u201d:\n\n\n       Rumble(\\\"play\\\", {\\\"video\\\": \\\"v594zn\\\",\\\"div\\\": \\\"rumble_v594zn\\\",\\\"autoplay\\\":2});\n\nThose comments by Harris attracted the attention of junk news and conspiracy sites such as Gateway Pundit, which republished an article of theirs from a nearly a year earlier asserting that Harris had \u201clied\u201d about being among the early groups of students who integrated Berkeley schools. \n\u201cKamala lied,\u201d Gateway Pundit declared. \u201cActually the classrooms in Berkeley were already integrated in 1963 \u2014 before she was born. Here\u2019s a photo from the 1963 Berkeley yearbook. And here\u2019s a photo from the Berkeley 1964 yearbook \u2014 the year Kamala was born.\u201d  \nThose photographs did document that black students comprised a significant proportion of a Berkeley public school\u2019s student body as early as 1963:\n\n\nBut the yearbook images posted by Gateway Pundit were from Berkeley High School, not from the area\u2019s lower grade-level schools. And that was a key detail.\nHarris was born in 1964, and Berkeley Public Schools didn\u2019t fully integrate until 1968, meaning Harris was still a grade school-aged child when the district was in its early years of ending \u201cde facto segregation\u201d by using buses to transport children, according to contemporaneous news reports. Harris entered the Berkeley public school system in 1969, when she began taking a bus to Thousand Oaks Elementary School in an affluent, predominantly white area.\nIt was misleading of Gateway Pundit to offer images of Berkeley High School\u2019s yearbooks in the early 1960s as evidence that Harris was allegedly lying about her role in education desegregation, because Berkeley High was (and is) the only public high school in the city, so it was integrated by necessity. But most of the district\u2019s local elementary schools were not integrated back then.\n\u201c[Berkeley High] was the only high school, that\u2019s where all the kids in the city would go,\u201d district spokesman Charless Burress told the Associated Press. He confirmed that 14 of the district\u2019s elementary schools weren\u2019t integrated until the beginning of the 1968 school year. Thus if Harris entered the public school system in 1969, she would have indeed been part of the second class of students in a newly integrated district.\nAccording to data published by the school district, in 1963 \u201cNegro\u201d students comprised only 2.5% percent of the student body at Thousand Oaks Elementary School, while \u201cCaucasian\u201d students comprised 95.1% of the student body.

{"evidence": "In August 2020, less than three months before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, photographs surfaced on social media supposedly showing several U.S. Postal Service mailboxes locked up to block voters from sending mail-in ballots.\nSome posters suggested padlocks and heavy red bars on mailboxes in several U.S. cities were part of a nefarious scheme by newly appointed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy \u2014 a political ally to U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 to make it harder for Americans to vote in the presidential election between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Nov. 3, 2020.\n\nThe claim surfaced weeks after DeJoy issued new guidelines for Postal Service mail carriers and clerks \u2014 directives that he framed as solutions to the agency\u2019s long-standing financial issues. Workers were instructed to leave some letters or packages at distribution centers longer than usual and informed them that management would no longer pay carriers overtime to complete all mail deliveries.\nMeanwhile, Postal Service employees and customers reported delays in deliveries. And critics of Trump accused DeJoy of making the changes to intentionally slow the mail, which, as a result, could force elections officials to invalidate mail-in ballots not returned by predetermined deadlines \u2014 and potentially increase Trump\u2019s chances of winning another presidential term (claims we could neither prove nor disprove in a previous investigation here).\nResponding to that criticism, DeJoy on Aug. 18, 2020, announced he would temporarily suspend the new initiatives \u201cthat have been raised as areas of concern,\u201d including the controversial July 2020 directives that eliminated overtime and some delivery trips.\nDespite DeJoy\u2019s reversal, social media users continued circulating photographs that supposedly showed Postal Service mailboxes being removed from neighborhoods (we explore that claim here), as well as pictures of mailboxes with the red locks \u2014 all evidence, they believed, of an alleged conspiracy to undermine voters\u2019 abilities to participate in the 2020 election and simultaneously avoid potential exposure to the COVID-19 disease at in-person polling places.\nMany social media users posted about locked mailboxes as though they had not seen them prior to summer 2020, adding proof, they alleged, of the devices\u2019 role in stopping people from casting mail-in ballots before the presidential election. Rex Chapman, a former NBA player and outspoken Democrat, said on Twitter:\n\nTo investigate the underlying claim \u2014 that the Postal Service deliberately placed locks on mailboxes in summer 2020 to stop voters from casting mail-in ballots \u2014 we first searched for evidence of such locks on mailboxes anywhere in the country prior to summer 2020. That proof would challenge the theory that the devices were only tied to a scheme by Postal Service leadership to undermine the 2020 presidential election.\nSnopes found an April 23, 2016, story by Los Angeles Daily News that included a photograph of two mailboxes with padlocks and red bars to prevent people from using or getting inside the boxes. The setup matched what was depicted in some of the viral postings in summer 2020.\nRichard Maher, a spokesman for Post Office operations in Los Angeles and Orange counties at the time, told the newspaper that the agency had retrofitted boxes across Southern California so carriers could install the locks during their last pickup of the day and then remove the devices the following morning. The locks, he said, were designed to stop people from illegally stealing other people\u2019s mail from inside the mail boxes. He said: \u201cWe do this where we have had incidents, or there is a problem where the box may be out in a not very well lit public place.\u201d\nAnother story \u2014 a July 5, 2018, article by The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, a newspaper for the New York City borough \u2014 also included a photograph of a mailbox with a padlock, red bar, and sign reading: \u201cTHIS COLLECTION BOX HAS BEEN LOCKED. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO OPEN OR USE.\u201d The article reported:\nPostal officials had placed locks on every USPS mailbox in the neighborhood \u2014 that\u2019s dozens \u2014 on Wednesday afternoon to prevent someone from setting off a bomb in one of them during the July 4 Independence Day fireworks display. [\u2026] A USPS spokesperson told the Brooklyn Eagle that the locks were installed \u2018in the interest of safety and security.\u2019\nBased on those reports, we deemed it false to assert that the locks were only part of some alleged scheme on behalf of Postal Service leadership to disenfranchise voters in the 2020 presidential election.\nNext, to fully investigate the claim that, even though the locks were not new, several devices were installed to prevent voters from casting mail-in ballots in 2020, we pinpointed where exactly people were reporting new locks to prevent mail-in voting. Social media posts that showed locked mailboxes in Burbank, California (a city in Los Angeles), Southfield, Michigan (a Detroit suburb), and Seattle, Washington, appeared to be the most widely shared or reported sources of the rumor alleging election interference.\nOn Aug. 19, 2020, we asked Ernie Swanson, a Postal Service spokesperson, about those posts specifically, and the overarching allegation that the agency purposefully installed locks on several mailboxes to suppress the vote. He responded with an email that read:\nMail collection boxes have locks placed on them usually because of acts of vandalism which result in the box no longer being secure. The locks have been in use for many years. The box is removed and repaired, if possible. The removed box is replaced with another box. I don\u2019t know how many boxes get removed for this reason in the U.S.\nIn other words, he confirmed the agency had used the locks for years prior to 2020 as security tools. However, he did not comment on the validity of specific reports in Burbank, Southfield, and Seattle, nor explain for what reasons, exactly, those locks were installed. He also did not explain whether the agency had increased its use of the locks in 2020, which could result in some Americans seeing them for the first time in their neighborhoods.\nHowever, it\u2019s also worth noting that one Burbank resident tweeted: \u201cThis Burbank post office has been locking up its mail boxes on Sundays/after hours for MONTHS because of theft. This is NOT an election thing.\u201d\n\nResponding to Chapman\u2019s tweet, specifically, another Burbank resident posted, too: \u201cThis is my post office. These mailboxes are open on the other side, you just have to get out of your car to mail them. It\u2019s been this way for months. This isn\u2019t part of the purge.\u201d\nIn sum, given the fact that the locks had been used prior to 2020 as security tools unrelated to electoral politics, the complete absence of evidence to prove Postal Service leadership had deliberately installed the devices to prevent people from casting mail-in ballots \u2014 as well as the lack of proof to confirm or deny whether the agency had upped its usage of the devices in 2020 \u2014 we rate this claim \u201cMostly False.\u201d\nHowever, regardless of whether you\u2019re seeing locked mailboxes in your neighborhood, it\u2019s important to note here: The Postal Service has not met its goals for limiting delays of first-class mail (which is how completed mail-in ballots are categorized) in five years, according to the Postal Regulatory Commission. In 2019, for example, the agency delivered only about 81% of its three- to five-day, single-piece, first-class mailings on time \u2014 when its goal was roughly 95%, per a June 2020 report by the commission. That said, Thomas J. Marshall, the general counsel for the Postal Service, said in a May 29, 2020, letter about the anticipated surge in mail-in voting due to the pandemic:\n\u201cThe Postal Service cannot guarantee a specific delivery date or alter standards to comport with individual state election laws. To account for delivery standards and to allow for contingencies (e.g., weather issues or unforeseen events), voters should mail their return ballots at least 1 week prior to the due date established by state law.\u201d", "claim": "The U.S. Postal Service placed locks on mailboxes to prevent voters from casting mail-in ballots in the 2020 presidential election.

Rutgers University\u2019s English department will change its standards of English instruction in an effort to \u2018stand with and respond\u2019 to the Black Lives Matter movement. In an email written by department chair Rebecca Walkowitz, the Graduate Writing Program will emphasize \u2018social justice\u2019 and \u2018critical grammar.'\u201d\nSeveral other websites and blogs posted articles that claimed that Rutgers had declared grammar, or \u201cproper grammar,\u201d racist. Some placed quotation marks around the word \u201cracist\u201d in their headlines and articles, indicating that that description had originated in something written or uttered by the university or its faculty.\nThose reports were false. Neither Rutgers, nor its English department, nor that department\u2019s chair, Walkowitz, described grammar, \u201cproper grammar,\u201d or the teaching or use of grammar as \u201cracist.\u201d Nor did they imply it was racist or use words to that effect.\u00a0\nThe controversy originated in a June 19 open letter published on the website of Rutgers\u2019 English department and signed by Walkowitz. The lengthy and detailed post outlined the measures being taken by the department in order to \u201cstand with and respond to the Black Lives Matter movement; to create and promote an anti-racist environment in our workplace, our classes, our department, our university, and our communities; and to contribute to the eradication of the violence and systemic inequities facing black, indigenous, and people of color members of our community, to which the #BLM movement and ongoing protests have drawn our attention in pointed and necessary ways.\u201d\nIn one of dozens of sections, Walkowitz wrote that the English department\u2019s Graduate Writing Program would be undertaking three initiatives. One of those was \u201cIncorporating \u2018critical grammar\u2019 into our pedagogy.\u201d On that, Walkowitz wrote:\n\u201cThis approach challenges the familiar dogma that writing instruction should limit emphasis on grammar/sentence-level issues so as to not put students from multilingual, non-standard \u2018academic\u2019 English backgrounds at a disadvantage. Instead, it encourages students to develop a critical awareness of the variety of choices available to them [with] regard to micro-level issues in order to empower them and equip them to push against biases based on \u2018written\u2019 accents.\u201d\nNowhere did the letter describe grammar as \u201cracist.\u201d Online posts that placed quotation marks around that word therefore misled readers by presenting it as a direct quotation. Walkowitz\u2019s letter also did not include statements that could fairly or reasonably be summarized as \u201cdeclaring grammar racist.\u201d\nContrary to Leonydus Johnson\u2019s claim in the Washington Free Beacon, the letter also did not \u201c[make] the racist assumption that minorities cannot comprehend traditional English.\u201d Johnson also falsely claimed that Walkowitz\u2019s letter endorsed or articulated \u201cthe idea that expecting a student to write in grammatically correct sentences is indicative of racial bias.\u201d It did not do that.\u00a0\nNeither did the English department propose to \u201calter grammar rules for nonwhite students,\u201d as the Washington Examiner falsely claimed.\u00a0\nIn fact, Walkowitz\u2019s letter explicitly stipulated that the \u201ccritical grammar\u201d initiative ran counter to what she called \u201cthe familiar dogma that writing instruction should limit emphasis on grammar/sentence-level issues so as to not put students from multilingual, non-standard \u2018academic\u2019 English backgrounds at a disadvantage.\u201d\u00a0\nWalkowitz told Hank Kalet, a lecturer in the Communications department at Rutgers and the author of a blog post about the controversy, that the department\u2019s plan would actually result in \u201cmore attention to grammar in the aggregate, not less.\u201d She added that, \u201cOur standards remain rigorous and high, and our goal is to help students succeed in academic writing and other writing genres.\u201d\nKalet provided a good summary of the error made by those who rushed to claim that Walkowitz\u2019s letter had \u201cdeclared grammar racist.\u201d Of the key paragraph in the letter, he wrote:\nThis passage should be clear to anyone who takes the time to read what is written. The \u201cfamiliar dogma\u201d here is the problem. It assumes that students from multilingual backgrounds will be harmed by a focus on grammar at the expense of broader writing issues. This dogma can leave students without the strong, sentence-level foundation they need to write well.\nWhat Rutgers is proposing\u200a\u2014\u200aand what the letter clearly says\u200a\u2014\u200ais a shift; it is not proposing to de-emphasize grammar, but to encourage \u201ccritical awareness,\u201d or an understanding of the history and development of English grammar, how it works, and the potential impacts of the choices made in the writing process.

{"evidence": "On 22 April 2019, a quote ostensibly uttered by then-Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris concerning an alleged plan to confiscate guns via an executive order started to circulate on social media:This was not a genuine statement from Harris.The quote \u2014 \u201cIf elected & you don\u2019t surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door\u201d \u2014 started circulating a few days after she talked about her views on gun control during a CNN Town Hall. During the event, Harris said she would give Congress 100 days to act on gun control before taking executive action:However, Harris never said the order would result in the forcible confiscation of citizen-owned guns.

{"evidence": "As the number of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease surpassed 2 million in early June 2020, the campaign to reelect U.S. President Donald Trump ended its monthslong pause on large, in-person events and announced it would host a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the coming weeks.\nDespite public health officials\u2018 recommendations at the time to avoid group gatherings and crowds to limit the spread of COVID-19, the Trump campaign announced on June 10 that it would host a rally at the Bank of Oklahoma Center, which seats almost 19,200 people, on June 19. Trump told reporters at the White House:\nWe\u2019re going to start our rallies back up now. We\u2019ve had a tremendous run at rallies. \u2026The first one, we believe, will be probably \u2014 we\u2019re just starting to call up \u2014 will be in Oklahoma \u2014 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. A beautiful, new venue \u2014 brand-new. And we\u2019re looking forward to it. They\u2019ve done a great job with COVID, as you know, in the state of Oklahoma.\nBeyond the event\u2019s potential threat to attendees\u2019 health, critics including high-profile Democrats and historians saw the announcement as a call to white supremacists during a national reckoning over racism following the death of George Floyd for two reasons:\u00a0Tulsa is home to one of the worst acts of racial violence in American history \u2014\u00a0the 1921 Tulsa race massacre \u2014 and the event\u2019s originally scheduled date of June 19, or Juneteenth, is a day in many communities that traditionally celebrates the end of U.S. slavery in 1865. So two days after the initial announcement from the Trump campaign, the president yielded to that backlash and said he would delay the event and instead hold it on June 20. He tweeted:\n\nBut as critics pointed out, the massive gathering still held the potential to expose large numbers of people to COVID-19. As if to confirm the danger, reports appeared saying the Trump campaign was asking attendees to agree in advance not to hold the campaign liable for coronavirus exposure:\n\nTo investigate the claim that attendees were asked to agree to a liability waiver, we went through the steps of reserving a spot at the Tulsa rally in the days before the event. To receive a digital ticket for the event, attendees had to complete the following form:\n\nAt the bottom of the registration page, the following text appeared:\nBy clicking register below, you are acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present. By attending the Rally, you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.; BOK Center; ASM Global; or any of their affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, or volunteers liable for any illness or injury.\nIn other words, to reserve an entry ticket for the Tulsa rally, people had to agree that they would \u201cassume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19\u201d and agree not to sue Trump or any organizers of the event if they got sick. That agreement essentially clears the campaign of any responsibility should attendees catch the virus.\nAt first, campaign leaders declined to elaborate on their plans to protect attendees\u2019 health once they were at the event. Then, on June 14, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters that attendees should wear masks. And campaign manager Brad Parscale said the following day that event organizers will hand out hand sanitizer and face masks (though they\u2019re not necessarily required) and check attendees\u2019 temperatures for fevers. He tweeted:\n\nStill unclear is if, or to what extent, the event will promote social distancing. It\u2019s possible people will stand or sit less than six feet apart from each other, despite recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to avoid that close of contact with people to prevent the virus\u2019 spread. Additionally, as of June 16, the CDC urged everyone to wear cloth face coverings when they leave their homes, stating on its website:\nConsidering the ongoing health risks due to COVID-19 and an upward trend in cases statewide, Tulsa Health Department Director Bruce Dart said he would rather the president hold the event at a later date. He told Tulsa World:\nI think it\u2019s an honor for Tulsa to have a sitting president want to come and visit our community, but not during a pandemic. \u2026I\u2019m concerned about our ability to protect anyone who attends a large, indoor event, and I\u2019m also concerned about our ability to ensure the president stays safe as well.\nAs of June 15, Oklahoma had tallied 359 deaths and 3,417 non-fatal cases due to the virus.\nThe Trump campaign had last held a big rally on March 2 in Charlotte, North Carolina, before much of the country shut down to curb the pandemic.\nIn sum, given the substantiating evidence that, in order to receive a ticket for the Tulsa event, people must click a box agreeing they would not hold the Trump campaign or event organizers liable should they catch COVID-19 at the June 20, 2020, rally, we rate this claim \u201cTrue\u201d.", "claim": "The reelection campaign for U.S. President Donald Trump required attendees reserving tickets for a June 20, 2020, rally in Tulsa to agree they will not sue the campaign or event organizers should they be exposed to COVID-19 at the event.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}

{"evidence": "An old story about Edith Piaf got a new lease of life in October 2017, when a web site devoted to \u201cpositive and meaningful content\u201d produced a short video recounting the iconic French singer\u2019s purported heroism during World War Two.\u00a0On 17 October, Fabiosa Australia posted an animated video to its Facebook page, telling the following\u00a0story:Neither the video nor the accompanying Facebook post provides any source, but this is an old tale that has been modified and embellished over the decades. According to one source, Piaf saved \u201cthousands\u201d of Jews (not 120) from the Nazi camps, and in\u00a0another iteration\u00a0it was the prisoners themselves who made their own fake IDs.According to Carolyn Burke\u2019s 2011 biography of Piaf, she used a seven-week tour of prisoner-of-war camps in Germany as a way to help carry out a mission for her secretary Andr\u00e9e \u201cD\u00e9d\u00e9e\u201d Bigard, who was part of the anti-Nazi Resistance movement:Shortly after her return home from Germany, according to Burke, Piaf was \u201calready planning her next trip there\u201d:According to later interviews given by Bigard, Piaf visited 11 stalags on that trip to Germany and\u2014 in Burke\u2019s words\u00a0\u2014 distributed \u201cidentity cards, maps and compasses. Sometimes the escaped prisoners caught up with her tour and were passed off as musicians.\u201d The mission was ended when officials at one of the camps became suspicious.\u00a0In French journalist Robert Belleret\u2019s biography\u00a0, Andr\u00e9e Bigard is quoted as saying that the singer had been part of a \u201cResistance network\u201d:After the liberation of France by the Allies, and the end of World War Two, France underwent what was known as the \u201c\u00c9puration Sauvage\u201d (the \u201cWild Purge\u201d)\u00a0\u2014 essentially a period of informal and often brutal revenge against those who had aided the Nazis in their annexation of France.According to the political scientist Michael Curtis, between 9,000 and 10,000 suspected collaborationists were killed. After this, official tribunals were set up and a period known as the \u201c\u00c9puration Legale\u201d (the \u201cLegal Purge\u201d) ensued. Tens of thousands of people were jailed, 6,763 were sentenced to death, and 768 of these were executed.\u00a0Edith Piaf was believed by some to have been a collaborator, due to her tours of prisoner-of-war camps and participation in Nazi propaganda efforts, and she was called to testify before a tribunal with a focus on French artists.According to Carolyn Burke, the tribunal had included her name in a list of musicians whose voice was to be banned from French radio, something that would have been a significant blow to her career. However, she testified that her first trip to Germany was made under coercion, and the second one was undertaken for the true purpose of giving prisoners money and helping them escape.Andr\u00e9e Bigard backed up Piaf\u2019s account, and the singer was cleared. Shortly after her testimony in October 1944, she gave an interview to the\u00a0Ce Soir\u00a0newspaper, in which she provided the now famous number of 118 soldiers having been saved by her actions, and remarked:\u00a0However, Robert Belleret casts doubt on this version of events, pointing out implausibilities and inconsistencies in the account\u00a0 and suggesting that the story might have been concocted so as to justify Piaf\u2019s visits to Germany (which were intended and used by the Nazis as propaganda in Vichy France), and to save herself from the wrath of the tribunals:\u00a0Belleret lists some of the purported details of Piaf\u2019s efforts to help Jewish people (sending them money and housing them) during the Nazi occupation, but notes that these names and numbers were provided by Piaf herself and her loyal secretary Andr\u00e9e Bigard, and that they could not be verified.\u00a0Carolyn Burke\u2019s biography, which casts a less skeptical and more positive light on Edith Piaf, also does not contain corroborating evidence (that is, evidence provided by someone other than Piaf or Bigard). It is possible that such evidence exists, or once existed but has been lost, or that the individuals who could prove that Edith Piaf helped them escape are no longer alive.

{"evidence": "The political skirmishing over how to address the problem of gun violence in the United States took a new turn in March 2018, with the publication of reports by right-leaning media outlets accusing President Obama of undermining the\u00a0National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).Partisan web sites reported that Obama\u2019s Department of Justice had forced the deletion of the names of more than 500,000 fugitives with outstanding arrest warrants from the NICS database. The reports centered around an exchange between Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) and acting FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich during a 14 March Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on School Shootings and Safety, quoted as follows by the Daily Wire\u00a0blog:The exchange was accurately reported, as confirmed in this excerpt from a C-SPAN video of the hearing:\u00a0What the \u2018s less-politicized coverage also made clear was that the policy change was the culmination of a debate that spanned three administrations, from George W. Bush\u2019s to Donald Trump\u2019s. According to a DOJ inspector general\u2019s report dated September 2016, the need for official guidance on the issue was first brought to the attention of the department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in 2008 (under Bush), and had still not been resolved eight years later as Obama\u2019s term was nearing its end:If the \u2018s reporting and Bowdich\u2019s testimony are accurate, the OLC finally did make its decision in late 2016, siding with the ATF on the meaning of \u201cfugitive from justice.\u201d But it was on Trump\u2019s watch that the policy became official, with the issuance of a 15 February 2017 guidance memo from the FBI which read, in part:As previously alleged, the guidance had the immediate effect of causing the names of some 500,000 subjects to be conditionally purged from the existing NICS database because they did not meet all of the above criteria. Below are charts from the FBI showing the total numbers of active \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d records at the end of 2016 vs. the end of 2017:\nTaken out of context, these figures are grossly misleading, however. Approximately 430,000 of the deleted entries are actually still in the database, just under a different heading. According to the\u00a0\u2018s reporting, those 430,000 names were all originally submitted by the state of Massachusetts, which under its own policy classifies all people with outstanding warrants, whether for misdemeanors or felonies, as fugitives from justice. Since Massachusetts law forbids anyone so classified from buying guns, all of those names were re-entered in the NICS database under the \u201cstate prohibitor\u201d category.That leaves a much smaller total of 70,000 people formerly classified as fugitives whose names were actually removed from the database (though some of those will be added back in if and when the FBI determines that subjects crossed state lines or qualify under other prohibitors).Despite the politicized reporting of the Justice Department\u2019s reinterpretation of \u201cfugitive from justice,\u201d which was undertaken in good faith to conform to federal statutes and resolve a longstanding conflict between agencies, there\u2019s no evidence that it was a partisan determination. The matter was first referred to the DOJ for adjudication under Bush, finally resolved under Obama, and implemented under Trump. Its consequences have been questioned by Democrats and Republicans alike.David Chipman, a former ATF official who now advises the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, has called on Congress to rewrite the statutory definition of \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d to include all people with outstanding arrest warrants.", "claim": "A decision by the Justice Department under the Obama administration forced the FBI to purge the names of 500,000 fugitives from justice from the background check database for firearms purchases.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

These fears, however, were for naught, as the Annabelle doll did not actually escape from the Warren Museum \u2014 it is, after all, an inanimate object.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Warren\u2019s Occult Museum was a real place and housed some of the artifacts collected by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo are perhaps most famous for investigating a haunted house in New York in 1975. That investigation inspired the book \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and several films of the same name. The pair also investigated reports about a Raggedy Ann Doll that was supposedly possessed by a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. This doll, which was later put on display at the museum, also inspired a number of horror movies.\nHere\u2019s an image from the New England Society for Psychic Research Facebook page that supposedly shows the real Annabelle doll:\n\nBut the Warren\u2019s Occult Museum is no longer in operation. Both Ed and Lorraine Warren have passed away, and according to Atlas Obscura, the museum was closed in 2018. The Monroe Sun reported that the Warrens\u2019 son-in-law, Tony Spera, was looking for a new home for the museum (it was reportedly closed due to zoning issues), but the paranormal property has yet to reopen.\u00a0\nThe status of the museum is a bit of a moot point, however, as this rumor did not start with any sort of police reports, ghoulish videos, spiritual sightings, or a frantic call from Spera to be on the look out for a demonic doll. In fact, Spera posted a YouTube video in which he disputed the \u201cAnnabelle escaped\u201d rumors.\nSpera said: \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you something, I don\u2019t know if you want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape.

She never left the museum.\u201d\nThis rumor appears to have originated with a mistranslation.\u00a0\nThe rumor started circulating shortly after the Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Annabelle Wallis, the actress who played Mia in the \u201cAnnabelle\u201d movie. Wallis talked about her new film, \u201cThe Silencing,\u201d as well as what it was like to work with Tom Cruise in \u201cThe Mummy.\u201d Wallis also talked about \u201crunning\u201d in her interview, and the Hollywood Reporter included a video of some of the \u201cescape\u201d scenes from \u201cThe Mummy.\u201d As this news circulated on Chinese-language social media sites, the news about Wallis running appears to have been misconstrued as Annabelle (the doll) escaping.", "claim": "The Annabelle doll escaped from the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut.

The image shows a woman at a 2017 International Women\u2019s Day rally, while the $41.6 million figure on her sign was what was spent on Viagra by the Department of Defense in 2014.The image initially made the rounds in relation to a separate controversy in 2017, when U.S. President Donald Trump announced a decision to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, claiming the military \u201ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender [people] in the military would entail.\u201d At that time, multiple news articles reported the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) was spending far more on erectile dysfunction medication than it would cost to provide medical care to transgender service members.The original sources for all these claims was a February 2015  article. That  piece presented figures provided by the Defense Health Agency (DHA), a subsidiary of the Department of Defense, which documented that in 2014:We contacted the Department of Defense, which confirmed almost all of these figures were accurate for the year 2014, with some slight corrections: the total number of prescriptions for erectile dysfunction medication was 1,178,423, of which 905,683 were for Viagra; the total spent on Cialis was $22,827,346; and the cost of prescriptions for active duty members was $7.68 million. The DoD also clarified that the number of erectile dysfunction prescriptions given to active-duty members in 2014 was 140,789, not 102,885.According to data posted on the public transparency tool USASpending.gov, the DoD continues to purchase Viagra.Attempts in both 2019 and 2017 to make political points by juxtaposing the controversy  with coverage for erectile dysfunction prescriptions for service members and their families don\u2019t serve their causes well. For example, the Department of Defense does provide coverage for such prescriptions, but it also covers birth control.In September 2014, the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center published figures showing that the rate of erectile dysfunction diagnoses among active-component service members had doubled between 2004 and 2013, and that 48% of cases were psychogenic, meaning the erectile dysfunction was linked to mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.For context, we asked the DoD for a cost breakdown of how much it spends on birth control, but we did not receive a response by the time of publication.

{"evidence": "In August 2020, conservative Americans launched a social media campaign to call attention to the shooting death of 5-year-old Cannon Hinnant in North Carolina \u2014 a murder of a white child they claimed received little media attention compared to the recent killings of Black men by American police.\n\u201cIf you were advocating for George Floyd but NOT for Cannon Hinnant you are part of the problem,\u201d another user wrote.\n\nWhile appropriating phrases from the country\u2019s social movement to end racism in policing, such as \u201c#SayHisName,\u201d the underlying claims of the posts were these: A Black man, 25-year-old Darius Sessoms, was implicated in the shooting death of Hinnant on Aug. 9, 2020, in Wilson, North Carolina, and mainstream news outlets purposefully omitted covering the death because the child was white.\n\u201cA 5 year old boy was executed in cold blood in America and the media is hiding it because it doesn\u2019t fit their preferred race narrative,\u201d one Twitter account posted.\nBased on our analysis of police statements, newsroom ethical policies, and the media coverage surrounding the child\u2019s death, we determined the former assertion was true and the latter \u2014 that the mainstream news media exhibited a pattern of purposely ignoring the killing \u2014 was false.\nSnopes reached out to Wilson Police Chief Thomas Hopkins and the Wilson County District Attorney\u2019s Office for documentation related to the case.\nThe requested records included a probable-cause statement that outlines officers\u2019 investigation and would likely be the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s argument in any criminal case. However, neither Hopkins nor the district attorney\u2019s office returned our phone calls or email messages.\nAdditionally, Wilson police personnel denied a reporter for Raleigh\u2019s local newspaper, The News & Observer, access to a physical copy of the police incident report, citing precautions to limit in-person contact to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, the newspaper reported. The reporter was directed to a web page on the city of Wilson\u2019s website for information on the shooting, and police declined to comment beyond statements posted there.\nThat web page did not include copies of a police report, probable-cause statement, arrest warrant or any other documentation to outline the criminal investigation. It began with the following updates:\nOn August 9, 2020 at 5:33 p.m., officers of the Wilson Police Department were dispatched to 5100 block of Archers Road in reference to a shooting. Officers arrived on the scene and located a 5 year old suffering from a gunshot wound. Officers and EMS personnel began performing lifesaving efforts. The victim was transported to Wilson Medical Center. Tragically, the victim succumbed to their injuries. \u2026\nOfficers of the Wilson Police Department have identified Darius N. Sessoms (Wilson/25) as the suspect in this case. Sessoms has an active warrant for 1st Degree Murder and has been entered as wanted with the [FBI\u2019s National Crime Information Center] database, with full extradition. The Wilson Police Department is using all its resources to locate and apprehend Sessoms at this time.\nBased on that statement, Wilson police believed Sessoms fatally shot a 5-year-old child on Aug. 9, and then fled. North Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Sessoms\u2019 arrest and identified Hinnant as the victim in a statement the following day.\n\nAccording to an interview with a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s office in Wayne County (about 30 miles south of Wilson), as well as the Wilson web page, a multi-jurisdictional team of law-enforcement officers including U.S. Marshalls arrested Sessoms in a home in Goldsboro, Wayne County, on Aug. 10.\nThe Wilson web page included this mugshot of Sessoms, confirming that he is a Black man:\nHe was booked in the Wilson County Jail without bond on charges of first-degree murder and made his first court appearance (virtually) with Wilson County District Court Judge John Britt on Aug. 11. There, Sessoms said he wanted to try to hire a private lawyer to argue his case.\nA GoFundMe page established by Gwen Hinnant \u2014 the child\u2019s grandmother, according to his obituary \u2014 included the below-displayed photo that confirmed the child was white.\n\nTo recap, it was accurate to state Hinnant, a white 5-year-old, was fatally shot on Aug. 9, and the person who police believe pulled the trigger \u2014 Sessoms \u2014 is a Black man.\nNext, we searched for evidence of an alleged scheme on the part of mainstream news organizations to eschew covering Hinnant\u2019s death because it did not fit within an alleged \u201cpreferred race narrative.\u201d\n\u201cFox News is the only mainstream outlet in the U.S. that has covered Cannon\u2019s gruesome murder,\u201d someone claimed, referring to stories about the case on FoxNews.com.\nTo unpack this claim, we specifically considered commentary by Matt Walsh, a writer for Ben Shapiro\u2019s Daily Wire, who wrote on Aug. 13:\nThe name Cannon Hinnant would be known across the country, and the name Darius Sessoms reviled the world over, if the races were reversed. \u2026 And there would almost certainly be rioting, spurned on in part by the incessant coverage.\nInstead, this story has gotten almost no coverage by the American national media.\nTwo days earlier, he tweeted screenshots that he said were negative search results for Hinnant\u2019s name on the following news sites: The New York Times, The Washington Post, Reuters, Yahoo! News, NBC News, and ABC News. \nFor the purpose of our analysis, we will consider those news organizations cited by Walsh as the alleged culprits of a nefarious scheme to keep the child\u2019s death quiet, as well as CNN and The Associated Press, two news organizations with broad audiences. As of Aug. 14, these headlines and other related stories appeared on the following news sites, partly disproving Walsh\u2019s assertion:\nIn other words, it was inaccurate to claim CNN, The Associated Press, Yahoo! News, NBC News, and ABC News ignored Hinnant\u2019s death.\nHowever, we found no related stories by Reuters, The New York Times, or The Washington Post, which meant we next sought evidence to prove or disprove the assertion that those sites purposefully did not cover Hinnant\u2019s killing as part of some conspiracy to cover up the killing of a white child by a Black man.\nFor that, we reached out to the news organizations to ask why they had not covered Hinnant\u2019s death and what factors go into those type of editorial decisions, and we will update this report when or if we hear back from them. The news organizations\u2019 ethical policies, which are available online, however, include promises to report the news accurately and fairly without bias \u2014 standards that, in practice, would prohibit the newsrooms from only covering certain stories and purposefully hiding others as part of some nefarious scheme because of the races of those involved.\nIn sum, while it is truthful to state that Sessoms, a Black man, was charged in the shooting death of Hinnant, a white 5-year-old, in North Carolina, there is no evidence substantiating a pattern of mainstream news organizations omitting coverage of the child\u2019s death to further a particular racial narrative or for any other purpose.

In this vein, several memes have presented claims that Omar once declared some version of the statement, \u201cWe are not here to be part of America. We are here to take over America\u201d:We found no record of Omar\u2019s having said these words. Further, even as a paraphrase, the sentiment expressed by the meme does not accurately reflect her views. Omar has made several public statements that explicitly detail her perspective as a refugee, immigrant, Muslim, and American citizen, and none of those sentiments involve her view that a Muslim\u2019s role is to \u201ctake over\u201d American society.\u00a0\u201cI took an oath to uphold the American Constitution. I am American as everyone else is,\u201d she told  host Steven Colbert in April 2019:In several public remarks, Omar has made the argument that American Muslims are just as American as anyone else and should, especially in a nation founded on the principle of religious freedom, be able to fully express themselves in the public sphere as much as any other American. In an April 2019 speech before the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), for example, Omar argued:Following that speech, Omar told Voice of America that \u201cshe was not elected to be \u2018quiet\u2019 or \u2018invisible\u2019 and that \u2018I have to use my seat and leverage to represent the voices of those who elected me.\u2019\u201d Omar echoed this point in the aforementioned  interview, telling Colbert \u201cwe\u201d \u2014 referring to herself and two other progressive female politicians in their first term \u2014 \u201care not there to be quiet. We are not there to be invisible.\u201dThese statements, articulating Omar\u2019s view that her job as an elected official in America is to protect her constituents\u2019 interests in Congress as described in the U.S. Constitution, are a far cry from the claim that she said \u201cWe\u201d \u2014 meaning Muslims \u2014 \u201care not here to be part of America. We are here to take over America.\u201dInstead, the words ascribed to her in these memes are a commonly employed Islamophobic trope that asserts Muslims are unable to assimilate into America and that their ultimate goal is to covertly change the fabric of American society in their favor. This brand of Islamophobia is known in some circles as \u201cstealth jihad\u201d (a hashtag explicitly included in some of these memes) or in academic circles as \u201ccivilization jihad.\u201d\u201cCivilization jihad essentially refers to the idea that Muslim migration is a \u2026 deliberate policy of civilizational replacement,\u201d said Jonathon O\u2019Donnell, who researches the politics of demonization as a postdoctoral fellow at the UCD Clinton Institute for American Studies in Dublin, Ireland. Terrorist acts, he told us during a Skype call for a May 2019 Snopes investigation about Islamophobic Facebook pages, are \u201cnot the real Jihad to these peoples. The real Jihad is this more subtle form of cultural infiltration and transformation.\u201dBecause Omar never said the words attributed to her in these memes, and because her actual views on the role of Muslims in American society run demonstrably counter to the notion that they want to \u201ctake over America,\u201d we rank this claim as false.", "claim": "U.S. Rep.

{"evidence": "In September 2019, we received multiple inquiries about news reports that claimed a scientist in Sweden had proposed, advocated or suggested that people should turn to cannibalism as a way of combating climate change.\u00a0\nThe Epoch Times published an article with the headline \u201cSwedish Researcher Advocates Eating Human Flesh to Combat Climate Change Food Shortages,\u201d which went on to report that:\n\u201cClimate change alarmism has taken a macabre turn that looks like satire, but isn\u2019t. It happened in Sweden. At a summit for food of the future (the climate-ravaged future) called Gastro Summit, in Stockholm on Sept. 3 to 4, a professor held a PowerPoint presentation asserting that we must \u2018awaken the idea\u2019 of eating human flesh in the future, as a way of combating the effects of climate change.\n\u201cIn a talk titled \u2018Can You Imagine Eating Human Flesh?\u2019, behavioral scientist and marketing strategist Magnus Soderlund from the Stockholm School of Economics argued for the breaking down of ancient taboos against desecrating the human corpse and eating human flesh. He refers to the taboos against it as \u2018conservative\u2019 and discusses people\u2019s resistance to it as a problem that could be overcome, little by little, beginning with persuading people to just taste it.\u201d\nThat Epoch Times article informed several other reports, such as the one posted by Fox News, whose headline claimed \u201cSwedish Scientist Floats Eating Human Flesh as Solution to Global Climate Change,\u201d and the London Evening Standard, whose headline read \u201cScientist Suggests \u2018Eating Human Meat\u2019 to Tackle Climate Change.\u201d\nThe right-leaning website Breitbart posted an article with the headline, \u201cSwedish Scientist Proposes Cannibalism to Fight Climate Change,\u201d and Hannity.com, the website of Fox News anchor Sean Hannity, reported that:\u00a0\n\u201cA European scientist speaking at a summit in Sweden last week suggested a controversial new trend to combat climate change: consuming human flesh as an alternative to animal products.\u201d\nAll these reports presented S\u00f6derlund as having proposed, suggested, or advocated for humans eating other humans as a way to combat the effects of climate change. In reality, the evidence for this is lacking.\u00a0\nMost reports based their claims on S\u00f6derlund\u2019s Sept. 3 interview on the TV4 television channel, which can be viewed in full (and in Swedish) below:\n\u00a0\nJames Savage, CEO and publisher of The Local, a network of English-language news websites in Europe with headquarters in Stockholm, provided Snopes with a translation of the most relevant portions of the TV4 interview, adding that it would not be accurate to say S\u00f6derlund \u201cadvocated\u201d cannibalism in his remarks.\u00a0\nIn the interview, S\u00f6derlund told the host his Gastro Summit presentation was \u201cpart of a series of investigations into different kinds of food to see where to draw the line.\u201d He added:\n\u201cWhen it comes to human flesh there are various taboos that are hard to break, and it\u2019s probably the case that human flesh will never be a large scale thing in the West or in our time. [But] given that there are so many taboos, it\u2019s important to understand why we don\u2019t want to do something. You could say this [presentation] is part of a study into things that people avoid doing.\u201d\nIn light of the taboo around eating human flesh, S\u00f6derlund said, \u201cIt would be difficult for anyone who wanted to break into the human flesh business.\u201d\nAt one point in the interview, the interviewer asked S\u00f6derlund how likely he thought it was that eating human flesh would catch on, in the same way that eating insects has been touted as a possible means to lower carbon emissions and combat food shortages. S\u00f6derlund responded that he thought cannibalism was unlikely to become appealing:\n\u201cTwo and a half billion people eat insects more or less regularly, but they\u2019re not in the Western world. And surveys that have been carried out on people\u2019s attitudes to insects as food show that very few people think [eating insects] is attractive and want to try it, and you\u2019d have to assume that human flesh would have an even bigger \u2018yuck factor.'\u201d\nHe later added: \u201cBut if we need to turn over every stone when it comes to climate and sustainability, it\u2019s still worth raising this question.\u201d\nContrary to the claims made in various news reports, S\u00f6derlund did not advocate or propose or suggest cannibalism as a solution to the challenges of climate change in his TV4 interview. Rather, he explained that the purpose of his research and his Gastro Summit presentation was to stimulate thinking about what people would and would not be willing to do or consume in order to combat climate change, or in the event of food shortages brought on by climate change.\u00a0\nThis is much less clear. The Epoch Times article included descriptions of S\u00f6derlund\u2019s Sept. 3 presentation at the Gastro Summit in Stockholm, using terms that suggested the author had watched a video of it:\n\u201cAt a summit for food of the future (the climate-ravaged future) called Gastro Summit, in Stockholm on Sept. 3 to 4, a professor held a PowerPoint presentation asserting that we must \u2018awaken the idea\u2019 of eating human flesh in the future, as a way of combating the effects of climate change \u2026\n\u201cHe can be seen in his video presentation and on Swedish channel TV4 saying that since food sources will be scarce in the future, people must be introduced to eating things they have thus far considered disgusting \u2014 among them, human flesh \u2026\n\u201cIn his talk, Soderlund asks the audience how many would be open to the idea. Not many hands go up. Some groaning is heard.\u201d\nWe have not yet found publicly available video footage of S\u00f6derlund\u2019s presentation at the Gastro Summit on Sept. 3, nor a copy of any slideshow or PowerPoint presentation. We asked the author of the Epoch Times article for further details about the source of her descriptions, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. The event\u2019s organizers told us they did not have a copy of the presentation, and S\u00f6derlund himself indicated that the presentation was not readily available to him, for technical reasons.\u00a0\nHowever, S\u00f6derlund did provide a firm and categorical rejection of claims that he had \u201cadvocated\u201d or \u201cproposed\u201d eating human flesh as a solution to climate change, and reiterated that his presentation \u2014 which involved a survey of attendees \u2014 was designed only to gauge where the audience would \u201cdraw the line\u201d in their willingness to eat various kinds of meat, and to \u201cask questions\u201d about this issue. In an email, S\u00f6derlund wrote:\nI am afraid that there have been several misunderstandings in the reporting on this issue. This is what happened: since many persons are expressing that they do not want to eat traditional meat anymore, one may wonder what we should eat instead. To collect some views on this, I had a chance to ask questions to an audience at a food fair; I showed a meat product and asked if the participants would consider eating it while I varied the content (cow, vegetarian substitute meat, insects etc). Human content was included in one version as an extreme case \u2014 to see where the limit is.\nThen, the issue ended up on various sites with alternative views on facts. I believe that the issue has somehow been hijacked by people who do not believe that global warming and other climate issues should be taken seriously \u2014 and, given this, it may indeed be useful to refer to events indicating that climate activists have completely crazy ideas (such as that we should eat each other).\nJust for the record: I do not want to eat human meat, I do not want to be eaten, I do not think that eating humans influences the climate, I am not an activist, I am just a researcher who thinks that it must be possible to ask questions about also the dark sides of what we humans do and do not do.\nNotwithstanding S\u00f6derlund\u2019s clear and detailed account of his presentation, without being able to examine a copy of that presentation, or watch a video of it, we can\u2019t determine definitively what he did and did not say. Until and unless that material becomes available to us, this element of the claim remains unproven. If that changes, we will update this fact check accordingly.\u00a0\nHowever, we can say that S\u00f6derlund did not advocate or propose cannibalism as a solution to climate change in his TV4 interview. Rather, he merely discussed it and explained that his research involved asking questions about it. For those reasons, this element of the claim is false.

The bragging point it offered was that the former first lady\u2019s book had sold considerably more copies in one week than the current president\u2019s book had in over three decades:However, we have to note from the beginning that accurate book sales figures are often difficult to determine, especially given the wide variety of retail outlets and publishing formats that comprise today\u2019s literary marketplace.  Moreover, as Electric Literature noted, sales figures can refer to any one of several metrics:That said, the numbers presented here were at least taken from reasonably credible sources.  On 21 November 2018, Crown Publishing reported to the Associated Press that Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir had sold 1.4 million copies since it had been released a week earlier: was also a hit when it was first published in 1987, spending 13 weeks at the top of the  best-seller list. Just how many copies it has sold over the last thirty-plus years is difficult to determine, however, especially since its publication antedated the adoption of the Nielsen BookScan sales tracking system.According to the 2005 book , Trump\u2019s first publishing effort had an initial print run of 150,000 copies, and an additional 170,000 copies have been sold since Nielsen Bookscan started keeping track of sales in 2001, which leaves a considerable gap of time unmeasured.

{"evidence": "A rumor holding that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had been kicked out of India has been circulating online since at least May 2017, when an article pushing this claim was published on the website Steemit:\nBILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION KICKED OUT OF INDIA\nYes, the Microsoft founder and the icon of the Third-World Humanitarianism has been kicked out of India as his fraud was called out. He came to India posing as a philanthropist and humanitarian helping the Third-World poor people by alleviating their conditions and yes, of course, \u201cVACCINATING\u201d their children.\nThis simply wasn\u2019t true. The Gates Foundation was not kicked out of India in 2017 when the Steemit article was published, and as of this writing in 2019, the Gates Foundation continues to work in that country.\nThe foundation is one of the largest private foundations, with offices all over the world. In India, the organization is primarily focused on the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar regions, where they are working to reduce poverty and improve access to healthcare:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/kSLB1akxtsc\nMore than a decade ago, the Government of Bihar made the decision to prioritize healthcare for mothers and children, and this focused effort has started to show impact. The child mortality rate in India\u2019s third-biggest state has declined since then by one third.\nAs part of this investment in its people\u2019s well-being, the state government sought partners who could provide technical support. Our foundation already had a team working on maternal, newborn, and child health, the area where Bihar wanted to focus, so in 2010 we started working together.\nThe public health system in Bihar consists of hundreds of thousands of health workers, from doctors and auxiliary nurse midwives in primary health facilities to ASHA and Anganwadi workers who provide basic advice and care to women in communities. We began by helping the government test new techniques and technologies to improve the quality of these providers\u2019 services in eight pilot districts. For example, to help frontline workers advise women about healthy practices like breastfeeding, we developed next-generation teaching aids based on digital technology. In facilities, we established a nurse-mentoring program that has, among other successes, doubled the number of nurses who wash their hands and wear gloves before and during procedures.\nWhen rumors started to circulate that the Foundation had been kicked out of India in 2017, the country\u2019s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare released a statement disputing those reports which stated that \u201cSome media reports have suggested that all health related collaboration with the Gates Foundation with National Health Mission (NHM) has been stopped. This is inaccurate and misleading. BMGF continues to collaborate and support the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\u201d\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s website has several pages dedicated to the group\u2019s work in India. The government of India has also dispelled the rumor that the foundation was kicked out. So, was this claim simply made up out of the blue?\nThe rumor can be traced back to a study by the global health organization PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health) to see if it could reduce the number human papillomavirus (HPV) infections by providing cost-effective vaccines to impoverished communities. This trial was conducted in Uganda, Peru, and Vietnam, but it was the group\u2019s efforts in India that caused controversy.\nBeginning in 2009, PATH worked with the Indian government\u2019s Council of Medical Research as well as local governments to provide more than 20,000 girls between the ages of 10-14 with HPV vaccines donated by Merck & Co. (Gardasil\u00ae) and GlaxoSmithKline (Cervarix\u00ae). India\u2019s government halted the effort in April 2010, however, when local news reports claimed seven of the girls involved in the trial had died after receiving their vaccines.\nThe government of India also opened an investigation into the matter. While the government accused PATH of a few ethical lapses (such as improperly filed consent forms), investigators concluded that the deaths were not related to the vaccines. For instance, one of the deaths related to a girl who drowned in a quarry, and another was linked to a snake bite.\nScience Magazine reported:\nState investigations absolved the trial\u2019s managers\u2014PATH and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in New Delhi\u2014of responsibility in the deaths. Five were evidently unrelated to the vaccine: One girl drowned in a quarry; another died from a snake bite; two committed suicide by ingesting pesticides; and one died from complications of malaria. The causes of death for the other two girls were less certain: one possibly from pyrexia, or high fever, and a second from a suspected cerebral hemorrhage. Government investigators concluded that pyrexia was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to be related to the vaccine, and likewise they considered a link between stroke and the vaccine as \u201cunlikely.\u201d ICMR\u2019s director general, microbiologist Vishwa Mohan Katoch, categorically rejects a connection: \u201cBased on the enquiry, it is certain that causality of the seven deaths was not at all related to the HPV vaccine,\u201d he insists. Other experts say that in the absence of autopsies, it is impossible to pinpoint the actual cause of death.\nSo, what does the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have to do with this? The Gates Foundation is one of PATH\u2019s global partners and reportedly provided funding for this HPV study.\nThe Parliament of India released a report in 2013 that chastised PATH for \u201cirregularities\u201d with the studies. While the report recommend the government take action against PATH, this global health organization was never banned from India. In fact, as of this writing, both PATH and the Gates Foundation continue to work in the country.", "claim": "The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was kicked out of India.

{"evidence": "In early February 2019, a meme reporting a rather exorbitant cost for the all-white outfit worn by U.S. House Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), including an alleged $1,200 for \u201chair and make up,\u201d circulated on social media:The sartorial choices of the newly-elected congresswoman are often an object of internet obsession, but we saw no evidence that her State of the Union outfit was any more outlandishly expensive than that of her colleagues. Gold-colored hoop earrings, for example, can be purchased for as little as $5, a far cry from the $1,700 cost assigned to them in the meme.Although no designer has come forward to publicize their participation in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s outfit,  magazine reported that internet sleuths went looking for the most noteworthy item: a white cape worn in lieu of a suit jacket.

{"evidence": "In Denver, Colorado, May 29, 2020, was the second night of major demonstrations against police brutality toward black people in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death. The demonstrations largely took place in front of the Colorado State Capitol Building. They were generally peaceful during the day, but turned violent in the evening.\nAround midnight, Denver police began forcibly clearing the area around the Capitol using flash bombs, chemical agents, and pepper balls. Shortly after that, on the\u00a0corner of Colfax Avenue and Broadway Street, a YouTube user that goes by the name Ghost Writer livestreamed an altercation between a black man who was driving through the area while police officers were stationed at an intersection. Based on social media posts and time stamps in the live stream chat, the incident appears to have occurred at approximately 1:05 a.m. on May 30.\nThe man did not appear to be associated with the protests, but seemed angered that his car had been allegedly shot at with pepper balls before he entered the intersection. The man then stopped his car, opened the driver\u2019s side door and stood in the street as he yelled at a group of seven officers. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shot at a car with a pregnant woman in it!\u201d\nIn the video, the man is heard repeating at least three times the assertion that the passenger of his car was pregnant before the officers fired several rounds of pepper balls toward him. As the barrage of pepper balls hit him and his car, he repeated multiple times that his passenger was pregnant. Overcome by smoke, the man got back in his car and drove away. It does not appear, based on the video, that the officers took additional action after firing at him and his car for several seconds. We asked Denver police what happened after the incident, but they declined to answer, citing that it was an ongoing investigation.\nDenver police\u2019s use of force guidelines for \u201cless lethal\u201d weapons such as pepper balls explicitly states that officers are prohibited from firing at a pregnant woman if the officer has \u201cprior knowledge of the pregnancy.\u201d\nDenver police have acknowledged that this incident did occur. Responding to the video, Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen told 9News, a local NBC affiliate, that he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about \u201csome of the snippets that I\u2019ve seen.\u201d We reached out to the Denver police via email with a detailed list of questions regarding the context for, and rationale behind, the actions taken by the officers in the video. In response, a spokesperson told us that \u201cThis incident is being investigated at this time. Once the investigation concludes, we will be able to provide more information.\u201d\nThe driver has not been publicly identified at the time of this reporting.

{"evidence": "In late summer 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of a viral Facebook post that claimed the popular energy drinks Red Bull and Bang test positive for various illicit substances, including methamphetamines, ecstasy, and the prescription opioids OxyContin and Suboxone.\nThe claims were posted in July by user Angie Rider Freese, who included photographs of what appeared to be a urine screen-test cup, with \u201cRed Bull\u201d written on the lid. We have edited her post for clarity:\n\u201cToday at work a patient had a Red Bull. [I] told him they [test positive] on drug screens. He didn\u2019t believe me. So I had him pour some in a new cup, and it [tested positive] for [methamphetamine] and [oxycodone] and [buprenorphine]. Also Bang will [test positive] for [ecstasy/MDMA].\u201d\nRider Freese subsequently deleted the post in question, but she later confirmed its authenticity with a second post in which she explained that she had taken it down because its viral spread had caused her to be inundated with friend requests and messages.\u00a0Although the original post was deleted, social media users have continued to share a screenshot of it, meaning its claims continued to be promulgated.\nThe claims were inaccurate and misleading in several ways, but they did allude (whether knowingly or not) to a flaw in some substance-testing field kits that have caused innocuous substances to incorrectly test positive for drugs such as methamphetamines.\nExperts told us that a false positive of this kind could, in principle, be produced in certain tests of a sample of Red Bull or other energy drinks, or a urine sample taken from a person who had consumed the beverages. However, we found no evidence of an actual pattern of such false positive test results.\nThe first point to clarify is that neither Red Bull nor Bang nor any other energy drink contains methamphetamine, buprenorphine (often sold as suboxone), oxycodone (often sold as OxyContin), or MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy or X). What the meme alluded to (whether knowingly or unknowingly) was the phenomenon of false positives, in which a drug test incorrectly indicates the presence of a substance that is not present, either in a biological specimen (usually urine and blood) or a sample of the substance in question. The ingredients of both Red Bull and Bang can be found listed here.\u00a0\nDespite Rider Freese\u2019s claim that the energy-drink samples tested positive for various drugs, it\u2019s not clear that the urine test cup in the second photograph illustrates any such positive tests. The test strips on urine screen-test cups, such as the one shown in the photograph, invariably indicate a negative result where two horizontal red bars are visible. The only clearly visible test strips in Rider Freese\u2019s photograph show horizontal, double red lines, suggesting negative results for unidentified substances.\u00a0\nThe second misleading feature of the meme is that Rider Freese said she used a urine screen test to screen for methamphetamine, buprenorphine, and oxycodone in a sample of Red Bull. This makes little sense, because that kind of test is used to screen for illicit substances in a person\u2019s urine, not in a beverage.\u00a0\nTesting substances, rather than biological specimens, is done via a \u201cpresumptive substance test.\u201d The typical use of such a test would be where police found a powder in someone\u2019s car, which they suspected might be a prohibited substance like cocaine or heroin, so they either send a sample of the substance for laboratory testing, or conduct a field test themselves.\nTypically, law-enforcement agents use a type of substance testing called colorimetric testing, which involves adding a small sample of the questionable substance to a liquid solution, and inducing particular chemical reactions that cause specific changes in the color of the solution. The presence or absence of those color changes indicates the possible presence or absence of the substance being tested.\nThe following is a helpful and relatively straightforward video guide to presumptive colorimetric drug field tests, produced by Florida International University\u2019s (FIU) National Forensic Science Technology Center:\n\u00a0\ufeff\nThese field tests are imperfect and can sometimes produce false positives. However, the preliminary or \u201cpresumptive\u201d result they produce is typically enough to give a law-enforcement agent probable cause to make an arrest. After that, samples are typically sent to a laboratory for \u201cconfirmatory\u201d testing, which either confirms the initial result, or shows that the initial result was a false positive.\u00a0\nMany private companies design various kinds of field-test kits and sell them to law-enforcement agencies throughout the United States. Those kits vary in their reliability, specificity, and sensitivity, and a pattern of false positives has emerged in recent years, with various innocuous household substances showing up as illicit drugs. For example, the Marijuana Policy Project has documented cases in which chocolate tested positive for hashish, flour tested positive for cocaine, and soap tested positive for gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), which is used recreationally and as a date rape drug.\u00a0\nIn 2017, Georgia woman Dasha Fincher was arrested and imprisoned for three months, awaiting confirmatory test results, after police performed a field test on a substance that produced a false positive for methamphetamine\u00a0but was in fact cotton candy.\nIn principle, it\u2019s possible that a sample of Red Bull, Bang, or some other energy drink could produce a false positive for one of the drugs mentioned in the July 2019 meme. However, we found no evidence of an actual pattern of Red Bull or Bang producing such false positives, which significantly undermines the claim that Red Bull \u201cpops\u201d for methamphetamine\u00a0and Bang \u201cpops\u201d for ecstasy.\u00a0\nIt should also be noted once again that Rider Freese attempted to support her claims with photographic evidence of a urine test cup, which is a different test and simply would not be used to test a sample of a beverage (or any other substance) as opposed to a urine sample. Moreover, that photograph did not clearly show a positive test for any substance.\nIt\u2019s possible but unlikely that a urine sample provided by someone who drank a can of energy drink could test positive for methamphetamine or other drugs. Even if it did, it would only be the result of a false positive, just as in the case of substance testing.\nKirk Grates, chemistry research project manager at FIU\u2019s\u00a0National Forensic Science Technology Center, told Snopes: \u201c\u2026 There may be some analytes that are contained within these aforementioned energy drinks that could possibly cause a false positive.\u201d\nCertain innocuous items have been known to cause false positives for various drugs in individuals who consume them before providing a urine sample. For example, the over-the-counter, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen has caused urine samples to give false positives for phencyclidine (PCP), and other NSAIDs have provided false positives for marijuana. The urine of individuals who use a Vick\u2019s inhaler has been known to provide a false positive for methamphetamine.\u00a0\nIn principle, it\u2019s possible that certain ingredients in Red Bull, Bang, or other energy drinks might trigger false positives for the drugs listed in Rider Freese\u2019s meme, but we found no evidence of an actual pattern to this effect. The photographs posted by Rider Freese did not constitute evidence of a positive result for any substance, and, anyway, she claimed to have used a urine screen test cup to test a sample of Red Bull itself, rather than the urine of an individual who had consumed the drink.\nOn the whole, we found no evidence to support the specific claims made in the meme, which was in any case expressed in confusing and misleading terms. However, the meme may have alluded (whether knowingly or unknowingly) to the possibility that the energy drinks in question, like other innocuous products, could in theory produce false-positive test results for the drugs listed in the meme, either through substance or urine testing.\u00a0\nAs such, we issue a rating of \u201cMostly False.\u201d\u00a0", "claim": "Red Bull and Bang energy drinks test positive for various illicit or prescription drugs in substance or urine tests", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "In July 2020, amid a new wave of nationwide protests over racial injustice and police brutality, readers asked us to examine the accuracy of news reports and social media posts that claimed a Five Guys burger restaurant in Daphne, Alabama, had refused to serve police officers.\nOn July 8, local television news channels WALA, WPMI, and WKRG broadcast reports that all relayed the claims of Daphne Police Department (PD) officers, who said they had entered the Five Guys restaurant at the Jubilee Square shopping center in Daphne on the previous evening, but employees there had refused to serve them. One officer reportedly heard a Five Guys employee remark to their colleagues, \u201cI\u2019m not serving them.\u201d\nThe three local outlets also published articles on their websites about the incident. At the time, Five Guys provided the following statement:\nFive Guys and the Franchisee of the Daphne, AL location were made aware of reports that local Police Officers had been denied service by employees at that location. Five Guys and the franchisee are actively investigating the situation and are committed to getting to the bottom of it. However, no matter what the details are, we do not want these police officers, or any customer, to feel disrespected or slighted in anyway. We apologize to those officers and also want to make it clear that Five Guys and its franchisees are committed to fair, respectful, and equal treatment for all customers. We will continue to investigate the matter. Additionally, if there are questions about masks, the three officers who entered the restaurant were wearing masks.\nIn a statement, Daphne PD also clarified that the officers involved were wearing face masks at the time they were allegedly refused service.\u00a0\nSome social media users misrepresented the alleged incident in Daphne, Alabama, calling for a boycott of all Five Guys restaurants on the false premise that the company had a policy of refusing service to police officers.\u00a0\nOn July 10, Five Guys announced that some of the employees in question had been fired, and some had been suspended:\nFive Guys and the Daphne, AL franchise want to thank the Daphne Police Department for their support in working together toward a resolution. The actions the Daphne, AL franchise have taken include termination and suspension of the employees involved. The store has temporarily closed for further education and customer service training with a representative from the Daphne Police Department and will reopen at 4PM today, July 10th. As we uphold our commitment to fair, respectful, and equal treatment for all customers, please know that the actions and sentiments of a few employees in Daphne, AL do not represent Five Guys or the local franchisee.\nAccording to WALA, an unnamed police source had confirmed that several officers had indeed been refused service by Five Guys employees and that the officers claimed those employees had turned their backs towards them. Neither Daphne PD\u2019s nor Five Guys\u2019 formal statements provided any details on what had actually taken place in the restaurant on July 7, with the police account saying only that, \u201cThe events that occurred while the officers were in the restaurant were unfortunate.\u201d\nHowever, Snopes has obtained a written statement from a Daphne PD spokesperson. We asked whether the officers had been refused service because of their status as police officers or for some other incidental reason. In response, the spokesperson told us that:\n\u201cRegular customers were served immediately before and immediately after the officers left the restaurant. When the officers came in the establishment, they were refused service by two employees that were directly responsible for taking orders. Two of the officers involved overheard one of the employees make the statement \u2018I\u2019m not serving them.\u2019 After hearing this statement, the officers left the restaurant without incident.\u201d\nThe spokesperson indicated they could not confirm that some employees had \u201cturned their backs\u201d on the officers because of the presence of line cooks at the restaurant, who may not have been aware of the officers\u2019 arrival and therefore may have remained with their backs turned at all times, anyway.\nThe spokesperson also praised the response of Five Guys management and added: \u201cThe resulting backlash the restaurant endured as a result of this event was very unfortunate and I want to make it clear that we do not hold the restaurant responsible for the actions of a select few employees.\u201d\nThe fact that Five Guys has disciplined and fired several employees certainly indicates that an incident of note occurred on July 7, but so far the company has not actually corroborated the version of events presented by Daphne PD.\nWe asked the company whether they could confirm that some of its employees at the Jubilee Square restaurant did in fact refuse to serve police officers, whether they had turned their backs on the officers, whether any refusal had been on the basis of the would-be customers\u2019 status as police officers, the number of employees fired and suspended, and details on the investigative steps the company took before firing and suspending the employees. Despite making several attempts to contact Five Guys, we did not receive a response of any kind.\u00a0\nWithout the company\u2019s corroboration of the version of events presented by Daphne PD, we cannot conclude that Five Guys employees in Daphne did, in fact, refuse to serve local police officers, and that they refused to serve them because they are police officers. As such, we are issuing a rating of Unproven.

{"evidence": "A two-week effort \u00a0to rescue endangered and missing minors led by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) Missing Child Unit in August 2020 \u2014 nicknamed Operation Not Forgotten \u2014 resulted in the recovery of 39 children.\nAlongside other federal, state, and local agencies, the USMS said they rescued 26 missing children, and ensured the safe locations of 13 more, while arresting nine individuals in connection with alleged crimes ranging from sex trafficking to parental kidnapping.\nThe large number of children found during the initiative immediately attracted the attention of internet rumormongers. Snopes readers shared a number of memes with us claiming that the children were all found in one trailer.\u00a0\n\nHow is finding 39 missing children in a double wide trailer here in Georgia NOT the biggest news story in America?\n\u2014 King Randall, I. (@NewEmergingKing) August 28, 2020\n\nWhile the rescue itself indeed took place, according to the USMS, the descriptions of the circumstances around the discovery of the children in these memes were largely untrue.\nAccording to a statement from the USMS, and information provided to us by Josue Rivera, an inspector from USMS involved in the investigation, the two-week operation took place in various counties throughout Georgia, and children were also rescued from Florida, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. Since it occurred over a long period of time in more than one location, it is unlikely that all the children could have been found in one trailer. Rivera described at a press conference the locations where the children were found and the arrests of the alleged perpetrators were made, including motels, apartment complexes, and other residences.\u00a0\nThe U.S. Marshals\u2019 office described the different circumstances for the missing children:\nThese missing children were considered to be some of the most at-risk and challenging recovery cases in the area, based on indications of high-risk factors such as victimization of child sex trafficking, child exploitation, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and medical or mental health conditions. Other children were located at the request of law enforcement to ensure their wellbeing. USMS investigators were able to confirm each child\u2019s location in person and assure their safety and welfare.\nThe missing children ranged in ages from three to 17. We reached out to USMS and learned that fifteen of the children were identified as victims of trafficking. The other children were victims of parental kidnappings, children who absconded from the Division of Family and Children Services (DFACS), Department of Juvenile Justice custody, and were believed to be in danger or critically missing. A majority of the children were runaways who fell into the human trafficking realm.\u00a0\nInvestigators said nine people were arrested on warrants that included sex trafficking, registered sex offender violations, possession of drugs and weapons, and custodial interference. A few of the arrests were made in Florida, where one child was also rescued after being found with a parent who had arrest warrants for various sexual offenses. USMS provided us with a list of the nine people arrested and their alleged connections to the crimes:\u00a0\nWe should note that the USMS has been accused of exaggerating its success in the past. In 2018, the USMS said they found 123 missing children in an operation in Michigan, while state police said just four of the children were actually missing, and many of them were found with their guardians.\nDave Oney, a USMS spokesperson, told us that these headlines were \u201cmisleading.\u201d He argued that they had actually \u201ccleared 123 cases,\u201d and not rescued all 123 children. Many of the children reported as missing earlier had come back, he said, and the people who reported them had not updated the USMS.\u00a0\nOperation Not Forgotten was a joint effort between the USMS, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Georgia Office of the Attorney General, Georgia Department of Family and Children Services, Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta.\u00a0\nAccording to the most recently available statistics from the FBI, there were 421,394 reported cases of missing people below the age of 18 in the U.S. in 2019. Out of those, 90 to 91% were considered endangered runaways, according to Donald Washington, director of USMS, and one in six of those endangered runaways were likely to become victims of sex trafficking.\nGiven that the main source of information we have about the recovery of these missing children in Georgia is from the USMS \u2014 an organization that has been accused of misrepresenting numbers in the past \u2014 and there is no proof all these children were found in one trailer, we rate this claim a \u201cMixture.\u201d", "claim": "Thirty-nine missing children were found in a double-wide trailer in the state of Georgia.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "A recurring bit of pandemic misinformation alleges that COVID-19 is not caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or, for that matter, any virus at all. Despite voluminous evidence that COVID-19 is a viral infection, this claim \u2014\u00a0 or aspects of it \u2014 persist online. In general, the same flawed pseudoscientific argument has been employed in multiple instances to suggest that COVID-19 \u2014 with over 20 million cases and a death toll of over 160,000 at the time of this reporting \u2014 is just a big classification error.\nThe claim that went viral on several social media platforms blends the misinterpretation of a preliminary and unpublished research paper with the baseless assertion that the World Health Organization (WHO) mandated that no autopsies be performed on COVID-19 victims \u2014 a paranoid flourish used to imply a global conspiracy. By ignoring this alleged ban, the story goes, Italian doctors revealed that COVID-19 was actually a bacteria, and that, for some reason, aspirin can cure the disease.\nThe only factual element of the above narrative is that Italian researchers analyzed autopsy results of COVID-19 patients. They published a preprint of a research study based on post-mortem lung analyses of 38 patients in two Italian hospitals in April 2020. That study, which explicitly stated that COVID-19 is caused by coronavirus, suggested that a condition known as Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) was the \u201cpredominant\u201d feature of all of the cases. This potential finding was notable since pneumonia was thought to be the primary factor leading to death in COVID-19 cases at the time. While it is a general medical term used to describe a damaging immune and blood-clotting response to a lung injury, DAD is not a disease, but instead a condition potentially caused by a variety of diseases.\u00a0\nThat finding \u2014 along with the presence of clotting cells known as \u201cplatelet-fibrin thrombi\u201d in the patients\u2019 lungs \u2014 suggested to the authors that preventing complications from blood clotting (coagulopathy) could be a promising area for potential COVID-19 treatments. After this paper was uploaded to the preprint server MedRxiv, misinformation followed.\nAn inaccurate copypasta description of this study from mid-May interpreted those results as evidence that Covid-19 stemmed from \u201ca serious pathophysiological diagnosis error,\u201d that death from the disease stems from thrombosis (or blood clotting), and that the COVID-19 \u201cought to be fought with antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.\u201d This is how aspirin entered the zeitgeist. As a drug with anticoagulant properties, it could theoretically be employed to reduce complications from thrombosis.\nPerhaps because the inaccurate but viral description of the study included antibiotics (which would be used to prevent bacterial co-infections, not the actual COVID-19 infection) as a treatment, or perhaps because some online conspiracy accounts asserted it, online claims about this Italian study soon morphed into the notion that it exposed the coronavirus as a bacterial infection.\n\u201cBreaking Covid news!\u201d began a loosely intelligible bit of copypasta from late May, \u201cItaly has allegedly discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium.\u201d These results were only possible, viral claims now asserted, because Italian doctors had defied a WHO ban on autopsies.\nIt is unclear how the notion that a ban on autopsies was instituted by the WHO first emerged. As British fact-checking outlet Full Fact pointed out when the claim first went viral, \u201cthe WHO released guidance on [March 24 2020] on safety measures for managing bodies and performing post-mortems on patients who had died of Covid-19.\u201d Numerous studies have published post-mortem analyses of Covid patients, including some that predate the Italian study.\nOn top of that, there is no actual scientific debate regarding the viral origins of COVID-19, which was linked to a coronavirus even in the earliest public reports from China. Scientists have isolated and mapped SARS-CoV-2\u2019s entire genome based on samples taken from infected humans. Billions of dollars have been invested into finding a vaccine against it based on science\u2019s understanding of the basic fact that a coronavirus caused this pandemic.\nDespite the myriad factual hurdles one must leap over to label COVID-19 a bacterial infection, the claim (based on this same paper) persists. Some versions of the Italian autopsy story have been used to make an even more dubious assertion that the bacteria allegedly causing COVID-19 are \u201camplified by 5G.\u201d This claim, despite still being pushed by snake oil salesmen like David \u201cAvocado\u201d Wolfe, comes from a study that was retracted because its authors were found to have manipulated the peer-review process to get it published.", "claim": "By ignoring a ban on performing COVID-19 autopsies, researchers in Italy discovered that the disease is caused by a bacteria \u2014  not a virus \u2014 and can simply be treated with aspirin.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

Unfortunately, these  pictures are genuine.The photographs were first posted online by Facebook user Nick Spano on 22 September 2018.

{"evidence": "In July 2020, a rumor started to circulate online that typing any three-digit number followed by the words \u201cnew cases\u201d into Google would return news articles or other reports about COVID-19 in search results. This, according to proponents of this claim, showed that the coronavirus pandemic was nothing more than a conspiracy theory.\u00a0\n\nIn all honesty, we had trouble following the logic of this false rumor.\nThose spreading these \u201cmind blowing\u201d search results also appeared a little unsure of what it meant. Most of the posts we encountered did not lay out any specific claims or accusations. Rather, these messages contained vague statements about how the world was being \u201cplayed.\u201d As best we can tell, the idea is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (or, possibly, some shadowy group of elites, George Soros, or another frequently invoked boogeyman) were gaming search results in order to inundate the population with coronavirus content and convince everyone that this \u201choax\u201d was in fact a real problem.\u00a0\nThere are, of course, a number of problems with this theory.\u00a0\nMostly true. We have not typed each of the 900 three-digit numbers (100-999) into Google followed by \u201cnew cases,\u201d but we did perform a few dozen searches in this manner and in every instance we did get results related to rising COVID-19 cases. For some numbers (typically on the higher range of the three-digit set), Google had to dig back weeks or months in order to find news articles related to the specific search term.\u00a0\nNot really. Although some may see (or claim to see) these search results as \u201cmind blowing,\u201d this actually isn\u2019t all that unusual considering the duration (approximately 8 months, as of this writing) and widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nConsider this: The first case of COVID-19 in the United States was reported in January 2020. Since then, the disease has spread to all 50 states. In the approximately 200 days between the early COVID-19 cases and this writing, state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial entities have reported case numbers to the CDC. Many cities have also held daily press briefings. In addition to multiple entities recording and reporting on these numbers, there have also been national and local news outlets publishing articles on a daily basis about this data.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s take a look at the math.\u00a0\nIf each of the 50 states issued daily reports about COVID-19 cases for 200 days, that would mean 10,000 reports could contain a three-digit number of COVID-19 cases. There are approximately 19,500 municipal governments in the United States. If every one of those governments reported a daily rise in cases over this 200 days, that\u2019s an additional 3,900,000 reports that could contain a three-digit number of COVID-19 cases. If you factor in local and national newspapers and websites (we\u2019ll use 13,000, the number of daily newspapers in circulation in 2014; the actual number is likely much higher due to an unknown number of online news websites), that\u2019s an additional 2,600,000 reports about COVID-19.\u00a0\nEven if you reduced the number of possible days from 200 to 120 (lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020), that\u2019s still millions of daily reports that could possibly show a three-digit rise in case numbers.\nIt should also be noted that Google can return search results from international organizations, cities, and news outlets. In other words, there are millions of articles and reports that Google can comb through in order to find a result for each of the 900 possible three-digit numbers.\nHerein lies an even bigger hole in the conspiracy theory. Out of the dozens of social media posts we encountered from people spreading this rumor, we have not seen anyone correctly claim that the search results provided by Google were inaccurate. Our own searches resulted in genuine news articles from national and local media that cited credible sources.\nThe fact that searching for any three-digit number followed by the words \u201cnew cases\u201d results in genuine news articles about COVID-19 does not reveal that the world is being \u201cplayed.\u201d Quite the contrary: Testing this \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d actually shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is a real and widespread threat.\u00a0\nThis rumor appears to be an offshoot of a similar conspiracy theory that circulated last month. Previously, the word on the internet was that COVID-19 data was suspicious because a number of cities around the world had reported that there had been \u201c322\u201d cases or deaths from coronavirus. The fact that multiple locations had reported the same number of cases, according to proponents of this theory, \u201cproved\u201d that this pandemic was manufactured.\nAgain, this is simply a matter of probability. With thousands of cities, states, countries, government organizations, academic institutions, and newspapers around the world reporting daily on COVID-19 cases and deaths, it is inevitable that some numbers are going to be repeated.\u00a0\nUSA Today reported:\nThe content of the claim is ridiculous, as is the implication there is something shady or manufactured in the way these tallies are reported. The volume of media reports on COVID-19, the number of cases and the number of local and regional units of government means there is ample opportunity for tallies to add up to just about any number, particularly in the low triple digits.

{"evidence": "In late March 2020, amid a widening COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. President Donald Trump sought to blame previous administrations for the fact that frontline medical workers facing a spike in cases were reporting urgent shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE), notably N95 respirator masks that filter out particles in the air.\n\u201cSo, many administrations preceded me. For the most part, they did very little, in terms of what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Trump stated during a March 21 press conference when asked by a reporter about protective medical gear shortages.\nRight-leaning media outlets followed suit, focusing the blame more narrowly on the administration of former President Barack Obama in particular. \u201cReport: Obama Admin Depleted Stockpile of N95 Masks, Never Restored,\u201d a Breitbart.com headline read. \u201cLos Angeles Times and Bloomberg News: Federal stockpile of N95 masks was depleted under Obama and never restocked,\u201d Washington Examiner reported. Readers asked Snopes.com to verify the claim that the Obama administration was directly responsible for the shortage of equipment.\nThe reports on pro-Trump websites relied on selectively culled facts from other sources to weave a somewhat misleading narrative. It\u2019s true that both Bloomberg and Los Angeles Times, for example, reported that the national stockpile of N95 masks was largely depleted under the Obama administration during the swine flu epidemic, and that the depletion was not corrected.\nFrom the Times\u2019 report on March 20, 2020:\nAfter the swine flu epidemic in 2009, a safety-equipment industry association and a federally sponsored task force both recommended that depleted supplies of N95 respirator masks, which filter out airborne particles, be replenished by the stockpile, which is maintained by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nThat didn\u2019t happen, according to Charles Johnson, president of the International Safety Equipment Assn.\nBut both the Times and Bloomberg pointed out that Congress and the Trump administration bore some responsibility for the current medical equipment shortages as well.\nBloomberg reported that Trump\u2019s Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar told Congress in February 2020 that the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), a reserve of emergency medical supplies, contained \u201c30 million surgical masks and 12 million of the more protective N95 masks. He said there were an additional 5 million N95 masks that may have passed their expiration date\u201d in the stockpile, which at that time had not yet been tapped to deal with COVID-19.\u00a0\nBut as far back as 2015, government scientists had estimated that \u201ca severe flu outbreak infecting 20 to 30 percent of the population would require at least 1.7 billion of the N95 respirators.\u201d The SNS didn\u2019t have that quantity on hand, even before the swine flu broke out (in 2009 the SNS distributed 85 million N95 respirators).\nThe Times also reported that the Trump administration, which is currently in its third year, ignored alarms raised by various government agencies early on that the U.S. was not prepared for a pandemic:\nAs the current crisis has widened, President Trump has attempted to deflect responsibility for his administration\u2019s poor planning, suggesting the coronavirus outbreak was inconceivable.\n\u201cNobody knew there would be a pandemic or epidemic of this proportion,\u201d the president said Thursday.\nThe opposite is true. The [Government Accountability Office], public health experts and others issued a steady drumbeat of warnings that America would sooner or later face a widespread infectious disease outbreak or a major bioterrorism attack and was woefully unprepared.\nIn both 2018 and 2019, U.S. intelligence agencies issued insistent warnings in their annual Worldwide Threat Assessment.\n\u201cWe assess that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support,\u201d the 2019 report noted.\nIt\u2019s true, as reported by Bloomberg and the Los Angeles Times, and the partisan websites that borrowed from their reporting, that the supply of protective masks in the Strategic National Stockpile was largely depleted during the Obama administration, which then failed to restock the supply. But it\u2019s also true that the Trump administration ignored indications that the SNS remained understocked and the country was ill-prepared for a pandemic in the years leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe claim that the Obama administration \u201ccaused\u201d or was solely responsible for the current shortage of medical equipment such as N95 protective face masks omits that wider context. We therefore rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d", "claim": "Former President Barack Obama's administration was to blame for the shortage of protective equipment like N95 respirator masks in the early months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

{"evidence": "Two days into the 2020 new year, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, setting off an escalating series of events that included Iran pulling out of its 2015 nuclear deal with the U.S. and other world powers, threats of retaliation traded in both directions, and the Iraqi parliament voting to end the presence of thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq.\nCritics of the president\u2019s decision voiced fears that it brought the U.S. to the brink of yet another long, bloody war in the Middle East. But some of Trump\u2019s supporters pointed out that former President Barack Obama also engaged in drone warfare.\u00a0\nFor instance, social media users widely shared a statistic that Obama ordered 542 drone strikes while president, resulting in the deaths of 3,797 people, including 542 civilians. Snopes.com readers asked us to verify the figures. Here is an example of the information and how it was being used on social media. We have cropped this Twitter user\u2019s name out for privacy reasons.\n\nOther than an apparent typo in the civilian death-toll count above, the figures being shared are based on the reporting of political scientist Micah Zenko, who in 2017 reported for the non-profit research organization Council on Foreign Relations that \u201cThe 542 drone strikes that Obama authorized killed an estimated 3,797 people, including 324 civilians.\u201d Zenko\u2019s figures are based on U.S. military press releases and news reports.\nAs Zenko noted, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released two reports tallying drone strikes under the Obama administration. The first reported that there were 473 strikes between January 20, 2009, and December 31, 2015, in \u201careas of active hostilities\u201d that included Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The second reported that there were another 53 strikes in the same region for 2016, bringing the total to 526, a figure that doesn\u2019t include Obama\u2019s final 20 days in office in January 2017.\u00a0\nThe reports provide ranges for fatalities, with 2,372 to 2,581 \u201ccombatants\u201d killed from 2009 to 2015, and 64 to 116 civilians killed in that time frame. In 2016, one civilian was killed while the report states anywhere from 431 to 441 combatants were killed.\nExact figures on total number of strikes and resulting casualties depend on the source. Independent organizations that have tracked air strikes made in the U.S.-led global war on terror generally produce figures that are higher than those produced by the U.S. government. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, for example, reported there were a total of 563 air strikes authorized by Obama, \u201clargely by drones,\u201d which hit targets in Somalia, Yemen, and Pakistan. Meanwhile, New America, a public policy think tank, estimates there were 571 drone strikes under the Obama administration in Somalia, Yemen, and Pakistan.\nThe drone program under Obama and the strike that killed Soleimani are not apt comparisons. The U.S. has been carrying out drone warfare in the region since the administration of George W. Bush, Obama\u2019s predecessor. Although such warfare has always been controversial, the fallout over the killing of Soleimani is the result of his status in the Iranian government.

{"evidence": "U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) is a career politician who cut his teeth in the New York State Assembly before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1981, where he served nine terms prior to winning a U.S. Senate seat in 1998.As the voice of the opposition party in the Senate, Schumer was frequently at odds with President Trump and the Republicans. These disputes spilled over into social media, where Schumer not only exchanged barbs with the president himself, but was regularly attacked by Trump supporters hoping to discredit him.In December 2018, some of Trump\u2019s followers shared posts asserting that Schumer had been \u201ccaught\u201d accepting excessive campaign contributions and failing to properly disclose expenses in 1998:The proximate source of the accusation appeared to be an 11 December editorial by Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson attempting to refute the argument that Trump\u2019s alleged hush money payments to mistresses during the 2016 presidential campaign constituted grounds for impeachment because they violated campaign finance laws.In defense of Trump, Carlson noted that both Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer paid hefty fines to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for past campaign violations yet suffered no further legal consequences for their actions (emphasis added):As we\u2019ve had occasion to explain before, the hush money payments Trump\u2019s attorney admitted making on his behalf and more routine campaign finance violations such as failing to comply with contribution caps or improperly disclosing expenses bear little similarity. Although Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign was indeed fined $375,000 by the FEC for not providing timely notice of contributions exceeding $1,000, the violation was not deemed intentional and did not rise to the level of a prosecutable offense.Neither did the violations alleged in Schumer\u2019s case rise to the level of a prosecutable offense, as enumerated in an FEC audit report released to the public in April 2001. The figures cited by Carlson roughly matched those contained in a summary of the audit published that May:As noted by the FEC, the larger figure ($6,354,835 in improperly disclosed disbursements, characterized as \u201cexpenses\u201d) comprised amounts that were erroneously reported as lump sum entries instead of being broken out by date and amount as required. The error was subsequently corrected.It\u2019s misleading to say that Schumer was \u201ccaught\u201d taking excessive campaign contributions. The contributions were categorized by the FEC as such on a technicality: Schumer\u2019s campaign failed to comply with a rule (later dropped from FEC regulations) stipulating that checks accepted from joint bank accounts be signed by both account holders. A small fraction of those donations were duly refunded, leaving an outstanding $854,404 in contributions that still met the criteria for being \u201cexcessive,\u201d FEC auditors concluded. The Schumer campaign committee\u2019s lawyer affirmed to Associated Press in April 2003 that:For the latter violation, the campaign agreed to pay a fine of $130,000 (not $138,000, as later claimed by Carlson and others). However, the suggestion that the violations and subsequent fine ought to have disqualified from remaining in office is unrealistic and naive.\u201cThere are always reporting violations in campaigns,\u201d a former FEC commissioner told us in February 2018. Some violations are more serious than others, but even when they result in large civil penalties (as in the cases of the Schumer and Obama campaigns), they are rarely regarded, in the absence of criminal intent, as having any bearing on a candidate\u2019s fitness to hold office. In 1993, for instance, the FEC fined Sen.

{"evidence": "In August 2019, as the topic of mass shootings again gripped the United States after back-to-back massacres, numerous pundits and social media users attempted to suss out the reason why such attacks keep happening.

One supposed statistic often circulated after a mass shooting is that 26 out of the 27 deadliest mass shooters in the U.S. came from fatherless homes. On Aug. 5, Fox News played a clip of Dr. Warren Farrell offering this statistic before an interview:\n\nThis statistic is both outdated and incorrect.\u00a0\nThe number is most often shared via a link to an article on Real Clear Politics. That article, however, is simply a blurb linking to a post on Patheos, which in turn cites heavily from an opinion piece by Suzanne Venker that was published on Fox News in\u00a0February 2018. If we follow the trail a bit further, we arrive at a 2015 article in The Federalist about the impact fatherless homes may have on young men (and more specifically mass shooters).\u00a0\nHowever, that article did not state that \u201c26 out of the 27 deadliest mass shooters came from fatherless homes.\u201d Instead, that article claimed that seven of the deadliest mass shootings were perpetrated by males under the age of 30, and out of that seven, only one was raised by his biological father:\nOn CNN\u2019s list of the \u201c27 Deadliest Mass Shootings In U.S. History,\u201d seven of those shootings were committed by young (under 30) males since 2005. Of the seven, only one \u2014 Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho (who had been mentally unstable since childhood) \u2014 was raised by his biological father throughout childhood.\nWhen The Federalist first published the article, the most recent shooting listed in CNN\u2019s article, \u201c27 Deadliest Mass Shootings in U.S. History,\u201d had occurred on June 17, 2015. Since then, 12 more mass shootings have been added to that list. The most recent mass-shooting suspect in the U.S., Connor Betts, who allegedly killed 10 people in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 4, 2019, was raised by both a father\u00a0and mother.\u00a0\nWe examined the original CNN list the Federalist article cited and attempted to find out if any of the other listed shooters was raised by a father. This information was not readily available from previous studies or databases, and newspaper records didn\u2019t always provide specific information about familial relations. Furthermore, it\u2019s unclear if the \u201cfatherless\u201d household claim would include stepfathers, adoptive fathers, or divorced parents. Because the Federalist article originally pointed to males under 30, it\u2019s also unclear if this \u201cfatherless\u201d examination should include mass shooters over the age of 30.\u00a0\nFor the purposes of this article, we searched contemporaneous news reports to see if any of the shooters originally listed in CNN\u2019s \u201c27 Deadliest Mass Shootings in U.S. History\u201d article grew up in households with a father. We found that several of them did.\nSeung-Hui Cho, a 23-year-old who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007, was raised by both a father and a mother. So was\u00a0George Hennard, who killed 23 people in Killeen, Texas, in 1991; Charles Whitman, who killed 17 people at the University of Texas in Austin in 1966; Nidal Malik Hasan, who fatally shot 13 people at Fort Hood in 2009; Jiverly Wong, who killed 13 in 2009 in Binghamton, New York; and Aaron Alexis, who fatally shot 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013. James Huberty, who killed 21 people at a McDonald\u2019s in the San Ysidro neighborhood of San Diego, California, in 1984, was raised by a single father (and later a father and stepmother) after his biological mother abandoned the family.\u00a0\nIn short, the claim that \u201c26 out of the 27 deadliest mass shooters came from fatherless homes\u201d is based on a misreading of outdated statistics. Furthermore, this claim was based on a list of the \u201cworst mass shooting\u201d incidents (what appears to be eight or more deaths), and so did not include all of the mass shootings in the U.S. As this list only represented a small portion of the total number of mass shootings as of the time it was compiled, it simply does not provide enough data to come to any conclusions about how a mass shooter is impacted by a fatherless home.\u00a0", "claim": "Twenty-six of the deadliest 27 mass shooters in the U.S. came from fatherless homes.

{"evidence": "In late October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of social media posts that claimed members of the family of U.S. President Donald Trump had been barred from operating charities in New York state, after they were found to have \u201cstolen\u201d from a children\u2019s cancer non-profit.\u00a0\nThe running of Trump family-related businesses and charities has been the subject of intense scrutiny, and even legal action, for several years. However, some of the allegations got a new lease on life in October 2019 after widespread sharing of one tweet, which read:\n\u201cNever Forget. The Trump family was disallowed from operating ANY charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity.\u201d\nNever Forget. The Trump family was disallowed from operating ANY charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. https://t.co/AwwbgWYDzB\n\u2014 Bruno Amato (@BrunoAmato_1) October 5, 2019\nThose claims were further promulgated a few days later, when a screenshot of Bruno Amato\u2019s tweet was posted to Facebook by a user who goes by the name Donald Shirley:\n\u00a0\u00a0\nWere Trump family members banned from running charities in New York?\nIn June 2018, then-New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood sued the president, his son Eric and daughter, Ivanka, along with the Donald J. Trump Foundation charity. Underwood wrote that:\n\u201cFor more than a decade, the Donald J. Trump Foundation has operated in persistent violation of state and federal law governing New York State charities. This pattern of illegal conduct by the Foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law.\u201d\nAs a result, Underwood asked the New York State Supreme Court to \u201cdissolve the Foundation for its persistently illegal conduct, enjoin its board members from future service as a director of any not-for-profit authorized by New York law, to obtain restitution and penalties, and to direct the Foundation to cooperate with the Attorney General in the lawful distribution of its remaining assets to qualified charitable entities.\u201d\nSpecifically, the attorney general asked the court to bar the president from running any New York-based charities for 10 years, and the other directors for one year.\u00a0\nIn December 2018, the attorney general and the defendants reached an agreement to dissolve the Trump Foundation and distribute its assets to a list of agreed charities. However, that agreement did not include Underwood\u2019s request that President Trump, along with Eric and Ivanka, be barred from operating a New York-based non-profit organization in the future, for varying periods of time.\u00a0\nIn January 2019, Letitia James took over as New York attorney general and continued the state\u2019s case against the Trumps. On Nov. 7, the state\u2019s Supreme Court published a final resolution of the case, one which did not bar either President Trump or his children Eric and Ivanka, from running charities in the state of New York.\nHowever, President Trump was forced to agree to certain stipulations involving governance, leadership structure and record-keeping, in the event that he wishes to become a non-profit director or board member within the state, in future. As part of the final settlement, Eric and Ivanka Trump were required to undergo (and have already undergone) \u201can in-person, interactive board training session pertaining to charitable organizations and the fiduciary responsibilities of those organizations\u2019 directors and officers.\u201d\nThe final resolution of the case, published on Nov. 7, made it clear that the New York Supreme Court had not barred members of the Trump family from operating or running charities within the state, and so this element of the claim contained in Amato\u2019s viral tweet was false. However, it should be emphasized that at the time Amato posted his tweet (Oct. 5), that final resolution had not yet been published, and it was released only after this fact check was published.\nWhen Amato made his claims, a realistic possibility still existed that the court might indeed accept the Attorney General\u2019s request to bar the family members outright from running charities in the state, for various time periods. On that basis, we originally issued a rating of \u201cMostly False.\u201d However, the case was subsequently resolved without those outright bans being implemented, and therefore we have change the rating to \u201cFalse.\u201d\nDid Trump family members steal from a children\u2019s cancer charity?\nThe allegations involving members of the Trump family and a children\u2019s cancer charity are separate from the New York lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that sought to bar some of the family from running charities in that state.\nAmato\u2019s viral tweet inappropriately conflated the two sets of allegations by claiming that the charity ban (which was requested by the New York attorney general, but not granted by the court) was the result of Trump family members \u201cstealing\u201d from a children\u2019s charity.\nInvestigations by both the Associated Press in 2016 and Forbes in 2017 found that the Eric Trump Foundation had misled donors and mismanaged funds, funneling money into Trump-owned businesses or other charities linked to the Trump empire.\u00a0\nThe Associated Press, for example, wrote that:\n\u201cA charity operated by one of Donald Trump\u2019s sons flouts philanthropic standards by financially benefiting charities connected to the Trump family and members of the charity\u2019s board, an Associated Press investigation shows. The AP found that Eric Trump has exaggerated the size of his foundation and the donations it receives. At the same time, the charity\u2019s payments for services or donations to other groups repeatedly went to one of Donald Trump\u2019s private golf clubs and to charities linked to the Trumps by corporate, family or philanthropic relationships \u2026\u201d\nAmong other claims, the Associated Press alleged that:\n\u2014 The Eric Trump Foundation failed to report multiple conflicts of interest by supposedly independent board members who work for The Trump Organization or Eric Trump\u2019s winery, as required by the IRS.\n\u2014 Based on its revenue and giving, the Eric Trump Foundation is a small-to-medium-sized charity. Eric Trump has repeatedly overstated its size. In 2015, for example, he said his group was \u201cone of the largest foundations anywhere in the country, anywhere in the world.\u201d Told of the claim, Associate Dean Patrick Rooney at Indiana University\u2019s Center on Philanthropy said, \u201cThat\u2019s just silly.\u201d\n\u2014 Though public charity boards are supposed to represent the public, Eric Trump has loaded his board with friends, relatives and Trump employees. They include two Trump company executives who served as senior presidential campaign aides: former Westchester golf club manager Dan Scavino and special Trump counsel Michael D. Cohen. The charity\u2019s executive director, Paige Scardigli, was a close college friend of Eric Trump at Georgetown University.\nThe 2017 Forbes article, which was included in Amato\u2019s widely shared tweet as a source, made similar claims about the operations of the Eric Trump Foundation. Those allegations haven\u2019t been tested in court and have not resulted in any legal action or prosecution.\nIt should also be noted that nobody involved is accused of \u201cstealing,\u201d as such, with that word being understood in the conventional sense of meaning theft or embezzlement of funds. What is alleged is that the foundation engaged in misleading practices and that it inappropriately used donated funds to pay Trump businesses \u2014 practices that could be regarded as \u201cself-dealing,\u201d rather than theft or embezzlement.\nIn June 2018, a spokesperson for then-New York Attorney General Underwood told the Associated Press that her office had opened an investigation looking specifically at the affairs of the Eric Trump Foundation and St. Jude\u2019s Research Hospital. We asked the office of Underwood\u2019s successor what the status of that investigation was in October 2019, but we did not receive a response.\u00a0", "claim": "Members of the Trump family were banned from running charities in New York because they reportedly stole from a children's cancer charity.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

{"evidence": "Grocery store receipts are rumored to contain chemicals that may disrupt the endocrine system and have been linked in scientific studies to hormone-related cancers and other health concerns.\nThis claim is true. Three-quarters of receipts made from thermal paper are thought to contain bisphenol A (BPA), a known endocrine disrupter that has been linked to infertility and hormone-related cancers, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Environmental Research.\nTo determine the extent of BPA and its chemical cousin, bisphenol S (BPS), in thermal paper, a team of researchers from the University of Granada (UGR) analyzed more than 100 receipts and tickets collected from Brazil, Spain, and France \u2014 an admittedly small sample size. More than 90% of the receipts collected in the former two countries were shown to contain BPA, compared with about half of those obtained in France. However, many receipts in France contained higher concentrations of BPS, which may also impact the endocrine system.\nBPA is an industrial chemical and can be found in a variety of products, including epoxy resins and water bottles. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that BPA exposure and consumption are safe at low levels, yet a growing body of research has linked the chemical to breast cancer, infertility, and obesity. Similarly, BPS has been linked to hormonal-disruption and may trigger the multiplication of breast cancer cells.\nEuropean Union-recommended levels of BPA found in thermal paper should be no more than 0.2mg/g as of the beginning of 2020, according to the UK\u2019s National Health Service.

{"evidence": "In December 2019, readers asked us about reports that claimed the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed changes to the way Social Security disability payments are made, which could cause thousands, even hundreds of thousands, to lose their benefits.\u00a0\nOn Dec. 12, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Chicago Tribune posted an article with the headline \u201cTrump Administration Proposes Social Security Rule Changes That Could Cut Off Thousands of Disabled Recipients.\u201d The article reported that:\n\u201cThe Trump administration is proposing changes to Social Security that could terminate disability payments to hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly older people and children. The new rule would change aspects of disability reviews \u2014 the methods by which the Social Security Administration determines whether a person continues to qualify for benefits. Few recipients are aware of the proposal, which is open for public comment through January.\u201d\nThe left-leaning website Common Dreams published an article with the headline \u201c\u2018A National Disgrace\u2019: Trump Proposes Social Security Change That Could End Disability Benefits for Hundreds of Thousands.'\u201d That story reported:\n\u201cActivists are working to raise public awareness and outrage over a little-noticed Trump administration proposal that could strip life-saving disability benefits from hundreds of thousands of people by further complicating the way the Social Security Administration determines who is eligible for payments.\u201d\nOn the face of it, the changes proposed by the Trump administration would not, in fact, directly or immediately strip disability benefits from thousands of would-be recipients, rather the changes would introduce more (and more frequent) eligibility reviews for those who wish to receive them. However, some critics have argued that those increased bureaucratic requirements would over-burden some would-be recipients, in particular especially vulnerable recipients, and would ultimately (albeit indirectly) result in thousands losing disability benefits.\u00a0\nThe Social Security Administration distributes disability benefits in two principle ways: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their previous Social Security tax contributions and history of work, and is paid out of the Social Security insurance fund; and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their disability status and inability to work, and is paid out of general tax coffers.\u00a0\nIn order to prevent potential abuse and waste in the system, the Social Security Administration conducts \u201ccontinuing disability reviews,\u201d essentially investigating whether each recipient still has a disabling condition, and if so, which kind. Those reviews take place more or less frequently, depending on the nature of each individual\u2019s disability, broken into three \u201cmedical diary categories,\u201d as follows:\nIn November, the Social Security Administration published its proposals to make several changes to the review system. The most significant proposal was to add a fourth medical diary category, \u201cMedical Improvement Likely.\u201d Recipients placed in that category would undergo a review every two years.\nAccording to a document accompanying the proposals, the decision to introduce the fourth category was made, in part, because the administration saw a pattern whereby some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category were being prematurely subjected to re-evaluation, after six-18 months, before a medical improvement had the chance to take hold, and some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category had successfully treated their impairment comfortably within the three-year review interval.\nThe introduction of the new category would therefore mean the bureaucratic burden on some recipients would actually be lessened, since they would be subject to review less frequently, though clearly it would also mean others would be subject to more frequent reviews. On the whole, the administration has estimated that, between 2020 and 2029, the new category would tend towards requiring more frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category, rather than less frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category:\n\nThe administration expects the introduction of the \u201cMedical Improvement Likely\u201d category to lead to an 18 percent increase in the total number of reviews undertaken over the next decade. This would therefore lead to an increased up-front cost in administering the disability benefits programs, and an increased aggregate bureaucratic burden to recipients (even if some individual recipients would actually undergo reviews less frequently).\u00a0\nGreater scrutiny of individual cases, and enhanced enforcement of eligibility criteria, results in some recipients no longer being deemed eligible, and no longer receiving either SSDI or SSI, which saves money for the Social Security insurance fund and the Treasury, respectively. For the 2015 fiscal year, for example, the Social Security Administration calculated a 19.9:1 return on investment rate for disability benefits enforcement \u2014 meaning that for every $1 spent on performing reviews, the government would save $19.90 on disability benefits that would otherwise have been paid, over the course of a lifetime, to recipients who are now deemed ineligible. To be specific, the administration estimated that the $717 million spent on reviews in 2015 would ultimately save $14.3 billion in lifetime disability benefit payments.\u00a0\nSo the introduction of the Trump administration\u2019s proposals is highly likely to ultimately lead to thousands of disability benefits recipients no longer receiving those benefits \u2014 both because some will be overburdened by the bureaucratic demands of more frequent reviews, and because some recipients whose medical status no longer meets the eligibility criteria will have that ineligibility discovered sooner. A considerable measure of truth, therefore, exists in the reports published by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Common Dreams.\nHowever, those articles failed to mention an important component to the administration\u2019s proposals: They would not change how a recipient\u2019s eligibility is determined, only how often that determination takes place. As the proposal stated: \u201cWe are not changing the Medical Improvement Review Standard that we use to determine whether a person continues to meet the disability requirements of the Act.\u201d\nThis means that, while the proposed increase in the number and frequency of reviews was highly likely to ultimately cause thousands to lose their benefits, that loss of benefits would not be arbitrary, or based on an application of a new and different standard for determining whether someone\u2019s health has improved. The standards and criteria for assessing whether an improvement has taken place would be the same as currently exist, and only the frequency of those reviews would change.\nIn other words, some recipients would be subject to more frequent reviews, but if those more frequent reviews result in a finding that the recipient still has a qualifying disability or impairment \u2014 based on the same criteria as currently apply \u2014 the recipient would continue to receive disability benefits.\u00a0\nIt could be that, as some critics have argued, the proposal represents an elegant way for the administration to save money by removing thousands from the recipient rolls without having to change eligibility criteria \u2014 the latter a move that would be more likely to cause public outrage or political opposition. However, on its face at least, the proposal involves enhanced enforcement of existing eligibility standards and criteria. That\u2019s an important distinction, and a significant omission from news articles that reported, with some justification, that the Trump administration had proposed changes to Social Security disability benefits that would cause thousands to be stripped of those benefits.\u00a0", "claim": "A November 2019 Trump administration proposal would end Social Security disability payments for thousands of recipients.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

The resulting estimate is about 700 workers, or 11.8 of Amazon\u2019s Ohio workforce.\u00a0We were unable to find any research or data on Amazon workers\u2019 availing themselves of food stamps in other states.\u00a0PolicyMatters Ohio sent us figures to corroborate their claims, which they received from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. (That data is available for download in spreadsheet form here.) Further, whether or not an individual qualifies for food stamps is determined by more than just income. Having a gross monthly household income at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty limit is an important factor.\u00a0However, you can also qualify for SNAP benefits with an income above the poverty limit if someone in your household is disabled or elderly, and the poverty limit is pro-rated depending on the size of your household.Another factor to consider is whether a worker is employed by Amazon on a full-time or part-time basis. Someone whose only source of income was their part-time job at an Amazon fulfillment center would earn a lower monthly income than a full-time worker in a similar position, even if they received the same hourly wage.This circumstance might well qualify someone for food stamps even if their hourly wage at Amazon were otherwise not too bad. In an email, an Amazon spokesperson told us that \u201cAmazon full-time hourly employees in Ohio earn between $14.50 and $15 an hour as a starting wage with regular pay increases plus Amazon stock and performance based bonuses.\u201dOn 1 February 2018, Amazon\u2019s jobs web site listed seven open warehouse positions in Ohio. Only one was full-time, a description which a company spokesperson told us entails 40 hours of work per week. The hourly wage for the part-time jobs ranged from $10.50 to $11.75, while a \u201creduced time\u201d position came with a starting rate of between $14.50 and $17 an hour. The full-time position had a starting hourly wage of between $14.50 and $15.According to a major 2016 report by the\u00a0non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a group that advocates for more sustainable community development, Amazon\u2019s warehouse workers across 11 metropolitan areas in the United States earned, on average, 15 percent lower than could be expected for a worker in that industry (page 39).Amazon told us this analysis was \u201cflawed,\u201d because it compared Amazon wages with \u201ctraditional warehouse jobs and compensation,\u201d claiming\u00a0 that the appropriate comparison would be between Amazon wages and retail wages, because \u201cthat industry more closely resembles the environment of an Amazon fulfillment center.\u201dAdditionally, the report\u2019s authors said it was difficult to ascertain exactly what proportion of warehouse workers were on permanent contracts, and what proportion were temps, but estimated (based on news reports and the industry average) that the permanent to temporary ratio was roughly 60/40.\u00a0A spokesperson for the company gave contradictory figures, saying: \u201cThroughout the year on average, 90 percent of associates across the company\u2019s U.S. fulfillment network are regular, full-time employees. That applies for states like Ohio.\u201d The spokesperson confirmed that \u201cregular\u201d means permanent. The ILSR criticized Amazon for using the label \u201cseasonal\u201d \u2014 which has connotations of the annual retail holiday rush \u2014 to describe the temporary positions it fills year-round.\u00a0Amazon has also previously come under fire for what have been described as difficult working conditions. In its 2016 report, the ILSR\u00a0summarized employment at the company\u2019s fulfillment centers as \u201cgrueling work for lower pay than average\u201d:In response to these descriptions, a spokesperson for the company told us:While the meme says that Amazon grossed $128 billion in sales \u201clast year,\u201d that number is not quite accurate. For one thing, Amazon\u2019s 2017 earnings had not yet been published in January 2018, when the meme was created. Instead, Grit Post, where the meme appears to have originated, said in a list of sources that they had used Amazon\u2019s 2016 numbers. Amazon actually had net (not gross) sales of $136 billion in 2016, according to the company\u2019s full year financial results. This means gross sales (which were not reported) were even higher than that, and certainly higher than the $128 billion claimed in the meme.\u00a0\u00a0Amazon\u2019s sales for 2017 are likely to be astronomical.Based on the company\u2019s predictions\u00a0for the final three months of the year, Amazon\u2019s full-year net sales in 2017 might reach around $178 billion.\u00a0", "claim": "Amazon employees \"earn so little they qualify for food stamps.\"", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "On 16 September 2018, Christine Blasey Ford identified herself publicly as the woman who wrote a confidential letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in the presence of his classmate Mark Judge, had sexually assaulted her in the 1980s when he was a student at Georgetown Prep, leading to tense negotiations about if and when Ford would testify before the Judiciary Committee. Following Blasey Ford\u2019s disclosure, several attempts were made to insinuate that Blasey Ford had confused Kavanaugh with another man, something she categorically denied as a possibility.The first prominent presentation of this argument was offered in a now-deleted, defamatory, and false Twitter thread from Ed Whelan, the president (currently on leave) of the conservative think tank the Ethics and Public Policy Center. In a series of Tweets, Whelan utilized comments left on Facebook posts, floor plans found on the real estate website Zillow, and yearbook photographs to accuse (by name) another Georgetown Prep classmate of the assault, based primarily on his physical similarities with a young Kavanaugh. Through her lawyers, Blasey Ford dismissed this possibility:Whelan later apologized for the incident and was placed on a leave of absence from the Ethics and Public Policy Center.\u201cI made an appalling and inexcusable mistake of judgment in posting the tweet thread in a way that identified Kavanaugh\u2019s Georgetown Prep classmate,\u201d Mr. Whelan Tweeted on 21 September 2018. \u201cI take full responsibility for that mistake, and I deeply apologize for it. I realize that does not undo the mistake.\u201dOn 26 September 2018, the night before Blasey Ford was scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, committee chair Chuck Grassley released a report that had the effect of suggesting, for a second time, that Blasey Ford\u2019s memories were confused. According to this report, between 24 and 26 September 2018, two separate men reached out to the committee claiming that they were in fact the person who assaulted Blasey Ford. The report, a timeline of investigative actions which Grassley maintained his committee undertook, included three references to these two individuals:The allegations made by these men, though offered \u201cin some detail\u201d in one case, have not been publicly outlined, and it is not clear if both of these men allege themselves to be the primary assailant, or if one of them alleges to have been the second man in the room at the time of the assault. For obvious reasons, both men cannot be correct if they both assert to be the person allegedly confused for Brett Kavanaugh.On 27 September 2018, during her sworn testimony, Ford was asked several times under oath if she could have confused Kavanaugh for someone else, and each time she emphatically and categorically denied such a possibility, first in an exchange with Senator Feinstein:In an exchange with Senator Patrick Leahy, Ford reiterated this point and provided additional information about the person whom Ed Whelan falsely accused of the assault, indicating she knew this other man well at that time:In response to a question from Senator Dick Durbin about her level of certainty that Kavanaugh was the assailant, Dr. Ford said she was 100% certain:No additional information has yet been made available regarding the claims put forward by the two men interviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee staff.", "claim": "Another man was responsible for the assault that Christine Blasey Ford described as being perpetrated by Judge Brett Kavanaugh.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

Discussions that attempt to equate pedophilia with sexual orientation have been contentious, primarily because of the false belief that members of the LGBT community are predisposed to child molestation. Those who argue against civil rights for the LGBT community often cast those rights as a slippery slope to legalizing child sexual abuse or bestiality.TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) did not deny the controversial talk took place, but they noted in a 20 June 2018 statement that TEDx talks are \u201care organized independently from the main annual TED conference\u201d and that the video had been removed at Heine\u2019s request because \u201cshe had serious concerns about her own safety in its wake\u201d and Heine cited \u201cresearch in ways that are open to serious misinterpretation\u201d:In mid-July 2018, several websites were taken in by a viral hoax that reported pedophiles or \u201cminor-attracted person\u201d (MAPs) were attempting to join the LGBT community and had created their own Pride flag.

However, the \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d requirement was later included in a spending bill signed into law by Republican governor Rick Scott in March 2018.The focus on Daniels\u2019 proposal prompted scrutiny of her own controversial background as a Christian pastor who preached about demonic possession, claimed that Halloween candy was \u201cprayed over by witches,\u201d and virulently opposed inclusiveness towards the LGBT community.In March 2018, the website Patheos drew attention to one explosive proclamation of Daniels\u2019 in particular, reported in an article headlined \u201cBlack Florida Lawmaker Thanks God for Slavery\u201d:That article cited an earlier Facebook video posted by the Freedom from Religion Foundation:The quotation is authentic.

{"evidence": "In August 2018, several news outlets around the world reported on a rare sexually-transmitted infection contracted by a woman in England, offering that information under scary-sounding headlines which raised the specter of a \u201cflesh-eating STD\u201d running rampant.Fox affiliates WFLD (in Chicago) and WTTG (in Washington D.C.) both reported \u201c\u2018Flesh-eating\u2019 STD allegedly making the rounds,\u201d while the network\u2019s Rockford, Illinois, affiliate WQRF went with the grammatically challenged \u201c\u2018Flesh-eating\u2019 STD causes genitals to \u2018rot away\u2019 making the rounds.\u201dThese headlines created the impression that an unusually dangerous or gruesome STD was increasing in its virality or prevalence. Perhaps the most egregious example of this representation came from San Francisco ABC affiliate KGO-TV, which offered the headline \u201cResearchers warn of resurgence of flesh eating STD after it\u2019s found in England\u201d:Neither KGO-TV\u2019s article nor the accompanying video segment provided any details about the purported \u201cwarning\u201d or the \u201cresearchers\u201d who had supposedly given it, nor any explanation of what was meant by a \u201cresurgence\u201d of the disease or the claim that it was \u201cmaking a comeback.\u201dThe basis of these sensationalized reports was a 22 August article from the English  newspaper, which read as follows:This original article gave the reader plenty of important context, much of it missing from subsequent reporting by U.S. news outlets.Firstly, the disease is \u201csuper-rare,\u201d and the basis of the article is a single diagnosis, itself apparently unprecedented in the U.K.So not only did U.S. news reports mislead viewers and readers by claiming \u201cresearchers\u201d had \u201cwarned\u201d about the disease (donovanosis), but they did so on the basis of just one diagnosis of a person living in Southport, near Liverpool \u2014 thousands of miles away from those news outlets\u2019 American audiences.As for claims that donovanosis is \u201cmaking the rounds\u201d or that a \u201cresurgence\u201d in the spread of the disease has occurred, nothing in the original  report (or anywhere else) supported those contentions.Any claim that a disease is becoming more prevalent or undergoing a \u201cresurgence\u201d must first provide data to demonstrate what its prevalence was during an earlier period of time, and then make a methodologically robust comparison with its prevalence during a more recent period of time. It must also clearly explain the geographical area or areas in which this putative resurgence is taking place.A single (apparently unprecedented) diagnosis of a disease in England does not constitute a trend, and certainly not one with any epidemiological implications for viewers in Illinois, Washington, D.C., and California.Second, the  article provided some context on what was meant by \u201cflesh-eating.\u201d As  noted, \u201c\u2018Flesh-eating\u2019 is just a scary way of saying an infection is destroying tissue.\u201d In this case, the disease (donovanosis) only begins to destroy healthy tissue (i.e., becomes \u201cflesh-eating\u201d) if ulcers attendant with it are left untreated and allowed to spread:According to the Centers for Disease Control, the treatment of donovanosis (also known as ) can be tricky, consisting of at least three weeks on oral antibiotics with the possibility of relapse after between six and eighteen months.However, serious destruction of tissue is not a necessary consequence of being infected with donovanosis. So the \u201cflesh-eating STD\u201d which formed the basis of so many frightening news reports and headlines in August 2018 was only \u201cflesh-eating\u201d under certain uncommon and preventable circumstances. Nothing in the original  article established that the infection actually reached this stage in the single case of the woman they reported on.While readers should of course take the usual precautions in order to protect themselves and others from contracting any sexually-transmitted diseases, the manner in which several U.S. news outlets described a single diagnosis of donovanosis in England had the effect of sensationalizing the implications for the public and included some elements of misleading or erroneous misinformation.", "claim": "In August 2018, \"researchers\" provided a \"warning\" about the spread of the \"flesh-eating STD\" donovanosis.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

One particular statement Biden made about health care for so-called \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrants was misreported and presented without context as his policy.\nSnopes readers asked us if Biden had ever said that U.S. taxpayers had an \u201cobligation\u201d to pay for the health care of 11 million \u201cillegal immigrants.\u201d We found that Biden was misquoted, and his actual platform said something very different.\n\nThe quote appeared to originate from a clip shared by right-wing media organization BlazeTV, in May 2019. The video carried the title, \u201cJoe Biden Says U.S. Obligated to Give Free Healthcare to \u2018Undocumented\u2019 Immigrants.\u201d\nIn the clip, a reporter asked Biden, \u201cDo you think the undocumented immigrants\u2026[that] are law abiding, should be entitled to federal benefits, Medicare, Medicaid for example?\u201d Biden responded:\n\u201cLook I think that anyone who is in a situation where they\u2019re in need of healthcare, regardless of whether they\u2019re documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they\u2019re cared for. That\u2019s why I think we need more clinics around the country.\u201d\nBiden echoed this in the June 2019 Democratic presidential debates. And in a December 2019 interview with Telemundo, he laid out the caveats in his plan: \u201cThey can buy into the system like everyone else\u201d under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\u00a0\nOn July 14, 2020, in a rambling speech, Trump misrepresented Biden\u2019s policy after it was presented by the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces. Trump said: \u201cThey want government health care for all illegal aliens.\u201d\nBut here\u2019s what the task force actually recommended:\n\u201cTo ensure that people living and working across the country have health care access, the Task Force recommends extending Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients, allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase unsubsidized coverage in the ACA marketplaces \u2026\u201d\nUnder this proposal, taxpayers would not be paying for undocumented immigrants\u2019 health care, rather undocumented immigrants could have the option to pay out-of-pocket for health coverage through the ACA exchange marketplace, but without access to the government subsidies that are available to others.\nIn 2019 Brookings estimated that there are 10.5 to 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Currently, they cannot enroll in Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or purchase insurance through the ACA marketplace. Some state-funded or locally-funded health programs provide coverage regardless of immigration status. Emergency health services and safety-net clinics are already available to undocumented immigrants, which Biden had advocated for before.\u00a0\nIn summary, even though Biden did state that the U.S. had an obligation to ensure immigrants received health care, his views were largely misrepresented and did not reflect his current policy.

{"evidence": "In April 2019, Washington state Sen.

However, she made her remarks in a very specific context, and was not referring to all nurses everywhere, despite the impression given in much subsequent commentary and reporting.\u00a0The Walla Walla senator was speaking during a Washington Senate floor debate on 16\u00a0April, on the subject of SHB 1155, a piece of legislation that would require health-care providers to give clinical employees uninterrupted meal and rest breaks during their shifts, except in emergencies.More specifically, Walsh was speaking in support of Amendment 724, which was put forward by her Republican colleague State Sen. Curtis King. That amendment would exempt a certain category of hospitals (Critical Access Hospitals) from the requirements of the bill.Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) are smaller, typically rural hospitals with fewer than 25\u00a0in-patient beds that are legally designated as CAHs by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Because they typically serve relatively isolated rural communities, they receive certain financial support and benefits from the federal government in order to ensure their ongoing sustainability.\u00a0Walsh supported the proposed exemption of CAHs from the meal and rest-break requirements in SHB\u00a01155, arguing that staff there were not typically as busy as their counterparts in other hospitals, and therefore did not require such mandatory regular breaks. In the interest of completeness, here are Walsh\u2019s remarks in full, which can also be watched here (beginning at around 9:10):In a statement sent to Snopes, the Washington State Nurses Association rejected one of the premises of Walsh\u2019s call for CAHs to be exempted from the proposed new requirements, arguing that, far from being in grave financial danger, \u201cthe majority of these small, rural hospitals are financially healthy and well equipped to implement SHB 1155\u2019s patient safety standards,\u201d adding that: \u201cOver the last four years of reports, the total net income (surplus) for Washington\u2019s 40 critical access hospitals is $208,657,776, with an average surplus of $5,216,444 per hospital.When one views Walsh\u2019s remarks in their full and proper context, it\u2019s clear that her \u201cplaying cards\u201d comment related specifically to nurses in CAHs (\u201cthose nurses\u201d). She was not claiming that all nurses everywhere spend much of their working days playing cards.This is in contrast to the impression created by much of the subsequent coverage of her remarks. For example, Nurse.org summarized her remarks as \u201cNurses \u2018play cards for a considerable amount of the day,'\u201d without reflecting that Walsh was actually describing only a relatively small subcategory of nurses.On 19\u00a0April, Juliana Bindas started an online petition on Change.org that called for Walsh to follow a nurse around during a 12-hour shift. The text that accompanied the petition (which had more than 500,000 signatures as of 22 April) also provided a misleading characterization of the senator\u2019s comments, claiming \u201cSenator Maureen Walsh stated that we as nurses mostly spend our 12\u00a0hour shifts playing cards.\u201dSimilarly, many online memes and social media responses markedly failed to recognize that Walsh\u2019s remarks had referred to a specific cohort of nurses, and not all nurses in every context.\u00a0Headlines published by major national news outlets including CNN and The Hill also failed to reflect the specific context of Walsh\u2019s comments, instead giving the misleading impression she had been talking about all nurses.On 20\u00a0April, Walsh told the  newspaper she regretted her comments, saying \u201cI was tired. I said something I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d In a statement provided to the local KEPR television station, the state senator elaborated further and clarified that her remarks were indeed specifically in reference to nurses at CAHs:\u201cMy Mother was [a registered nurse] for many years and I have the greatest respect for nurses. The comment made about the ability to play cards was referring to the staff at the very rural and small critical access hospitals who may only serve a handful of patients and [where] the staffing mandates are unnecessary.\u201dOn 16\u00a0April, the Washington State Senate passed Amendment 724, along with the revised version of SHB\u00a01155, which subsequently included an exemption for CAHs. In the House, a different version of the bill had already been passed, meaning the legislation was scheduled for reconciliation between the two chambers, as of 22\u00a0April.", "claim": "Washington state Sen.

{"evidence": "In 2019, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachussetts began to resile from previous statements she had made about her Native American ancestry, a source of criticism that had been used against her since she first ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012.During that 2012 campaign, the  revealed that Warren had listed herself as a member of a racial or ethnic minority in a directory of law professors between 1985 and 1996, after it emerged that Harvard Law School, where she taught from 1995 to 2011, had publicly described her as a Native American during her tenure there. (In 2018, dozens of Warren\u2019s colleagues over her decades as a law professor told the  that perceptions of her Native American ancestry had played no role in her rise through the ranks of legal academia.)In reality, Warren has very little Native American ancestry (albeit more than the average American of European origins), but her public pronouncements, including professing herself to be \u201cvery proud\u201d of her heritage, have attracted criticism and even ridicule since 2012. President Donald Trump routinely refers to the Democratic senator with the mocking epithet \u201cPocahontas\u201d and on one occasion offered to pay $1 million to a charity of Warren\u2019s choice if she could demonstrate Native American ancestry.Warren did just that in October 2018, when she published the results of a DNA test which concluded that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of her ancestry was European but that her lineage was very likely to include one Native American ancestor somewhere between six and 10 generations ago.The DNA test engendered further controversy, and Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. strongly criticized Warren\u2019s actions, writing in a statement that \u201cUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. It makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is proven. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\u201dOn 31 December 2018, Warren announced she was launching an exploratory committee for a 2020 presidential campaign and was widely expected to formally declare her candidacy for that office in early 2019.Against that background, the high-profile Democrat began in February 2019 to step back from her earlier public statements about her Native American ancestry.First, the Cherokee Nation revealed that Warren had contacted tribal leaders and apologized for touting the results of her DNA test as evidence of her Native American ancestry. Then on 5 February, the  reported that Warren had issued a significantly expanded statement, apologizing for describing herself as Native American for many years:The revelation that Warren had personally described herself as \u201cAmerican Indian,\u201d in her own handwriting, formed the basis of widespread news reports on 5 and 6 February 2019 and prompted enquiries from Snopes readers about the authenticity of the document described by the .We can confirm that the document is authentic.

{"evidence": "On 1 May 2019, the scientific journal  published research that found, among other things, the presence of cocaine in \u201c100% of samples\u201d of freshwater shrimp () from 15 sites across Suffolk, UK. The purpose of the study, titled \u201cBiomonitoring of pesticides, pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in a freshwater invertebrate to estimate toxic or effect pressure\u201d was two-fold: to present a method for quantifying the presence of pesticide, pharmaceutical, and drugs of abuse in ecological settings, and to develop methods to estimate the relative amount of harm, or effect, each of these chemicals poses to the organisms in those environments.In a press release, lead author Thomas Miller, a post-doctoral researcher at King\u2019s College London, said, \u201cThe most frequently detected compounds were illicit drugs, including cocaine and ketamine, and a banned pesticide, fenuron.\u201d The investigators were able to identify 56 compounds among the shrimp samples. The researchers also sampled the water in the streams in which the shrimp were found. Here, too, cocaine was identified in all of the sites, suggesting its occurrence is widespread and not localized to any one source of contamination. The concentrations, however, were \u201cgenerally very low\u201d:Speaking to NPR, Emma Rosi, who was not involved in this study but who has, as an aquatic ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, performed similar work, said: \u201cPharmaceuticals and personal care products and pesticides and these types of illicit drugs have been detected in surface waters all over the world, because when we use them, our waste isn\u2019t always treated properly, and so they come out in rivers and streams.\u201d Rossi\u2019s past work has identified more than 60 pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic invertebrates and spiders in streams near Melbourne, Australia.The question of what effect these compounds have on the organisms studied is a different one. Previous studies have, for example, attempted to ascertain if the behavior or other attributes of minnows exposed to concentrations of antidepressants found in some bodies of water changed as a result of that exposure. One study demonstrated that minnows\u2019 \u201clarval survival behaviors are imperiled by their current environmental exposure to antidepressant mixtures,\u201d and that \u201canatomical variations in body length were also produced.\u201d Another study by the same researchers found that minnows\u2019 \u201canatomy and physiology, but not reproductive behavior, can be disrupted by exposure to environmental concentrations of some antidepressants.\u201dIn the shrimp study, the researchers attempted to quantify the potential effect on shrimp using a different quantitative measure based on the toxicity of the various chemicals at issue. For nearly all of the chemicals, including cocaine, they concluded that, \u201cThe potential for any effect is likely to be low.\u201d Still, the presence of any illicit drugs in these shrimp was surprising to the researchers.

{"evidence": "In June 2020, Snopes received numerous inquires from readers wondering if mixing Dawn dish soap with Clorox bleach products during household cleaning sprees could emit a toxic gas that would kill them.\nThe question largely seemed to stem from social media posts and blog entries suggesting that that brand of dish soap contained ammonia and, when mixed with bleach, could create hazardous fumes. One Michigan-based DIY lifestyle blogger wrote:\nLast week I was researching some\u00a0unexpected homemade stain removers and that got me thinking about another homemade laundry product \u2013 my homemade no-grate laundry soap made with Dawn dish soap. \u2026BUT \u2013 not that long ago when I looked at the back of the bottle of Dawn dish soap I spotted these tiny words: \u00a0\u201cDo Not Add Bleach\u201d. .. Apparently the warnings found on some dish soaps that you should not add bleach stems from this potential chemical reaction [of ammonia and bleach].\n\nUpon our analysis of similar blog entries and posts, we determined the most popular claim to be this: Dawn dish soap contains ammonia even though it\u2019s not listed as an ingredient, and when mixed with Clorox bleach products, the results could be lethal.\nFirstly, to investigate the assertion, let this be known: ammonia, a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen (NH\u2083), is a colorless gas with a distinct, suffocating odor. It dissolves easily in water to create ammonium hydroxide, which is commonly used in low concentration to make a variety of household and industrial-strength cleaning products, specifically some glass and window cleaners.\nSodium hypochlorite is the active ingredient in chlorine bleach and is similarly diluted and mixed with other ingredients to make several household disinfectants, including many Clorox products for stain and soil cleaning.\nAnd when bleach is mixed with ammonia, yes, a toxic gas called chloramine is released into the air and can cause the following symptoms for people who breathe it in, according to the Washington State Department of Health:\nAnd in high concentrations, the gas can force people into comas or be deadly. Clorox states on its website:\nBleach and ammonia should NEVER be mixed since when the two combine, toxic gas is formed that could be fatal.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not just ammonia or products containing ammonia (like window cleaner) that can be a problem. Therefore, as a general rule, bleach should not be mixed with other household cleaners such as toilet bowl cleaners, rust removers, and acids (vinegar, for example) since toxic gas can also form.\n(If you do accidentally mix bleach and ammonia and feel one or more of the above-listed symptoms, immediately leave the contaminated area and call 911 or the American Association of Poison Control Centers 1-800-222-1222.)\nNow, we move on to the part of the claim regarding the composition and ingredient lists for Dawn dish soap. To determine whether the soaps contain ammonia and, therefore, should not be mixed with Clorox bleach products, we reviewed dozens of Safety Data Sheets \u2014 which outline product ingredient information as part of the United Nation\u2019s system for classifying and labeling chemicals \u2014 for the following types of soap:\nDawn Ultra Lemon, Ultra Dawn Original, Ultra Dawn Peach Sunrise, Dawn Ultra Plus Heavy Duty, Dawn Simply Clean Original, Dawn Ultra Berry Time Blast, Dawn Original Non-Concentrated, Dawn Ultra Plus Advanced Power, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Lavender, Ultra Dawn Free and Gentle, Dawn Simply Clean Apple Blossom, Dawn Ultra Antibacterial Orange, Dawn Ultra Pomegranate Awakening, Dawn Ultra Apple Orchard Harvest, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Aloe Water, Dawn Professional Dish Detergent, Ultra Dawn Platinum Vibrant Fresh, Ultra Dawn Platinum Advanced Power, Dawn Apple Blossom Non-Concentrated, Ultra Dawn Platinum Advanced Power, Dawn Pure Essentials Lavender Wisp, Dawn Pure Essentials Lemon Essence, Ultra Dawn Platinum Refreshing Rain, Dawn Simply Clean Summertime Showers, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Cherry Blossom, Ultra Dawn Escapes Malibu Sunrise, Ultra Dawn Escapes Fuji Cherry Blossom, Dawn Ultra Antibacterial Apple Blossom, Dawn Pure Essentials Lavender Wisp, Dawn Summertime Showers Non-Concentrated, Ultra Dawn Escapes Thai Dragonfruit, Ultra Dawn Escapes Caribbean Breeze, Dawn Platinum Erasing Foam Fresh Rapids, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Hawaiian Pineapple, Dawn Powerwash Dish Spray \u2013 Apple, Dawn Ultra Power Dissolver, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Peach and Almond, Ultra Dawn Antibacterial Hand Soap Orange, Ultra Dawn Escapes Hawaiian Pineapple, Dawn Ultra Botanicals New Zealand Springs, Ultra Dawn Pure Essentials Sparkling Mist, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Fuji Cherry Blossom, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Pomegranate Splash, Ultra Dawn Hand Renewal Cucumber and Melon, Ultra Dawn Escapes New Zealand Springs, Ultra Dawn Platinum Oxi Invigorating Berry, Dawn Ultra Plus Power Clean Refreshing Rain, Dawn Platinum Dishwashing Foam Fresh Rapids, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Green Tea and Honey, Dawn Ultra Botanicals Mediterranean Lavender, Dawn Ultra Total Clean \u2013 Pomegranate Awakening, Dawn Ultra Platinum Stainfighter Lemon Burst, Ultra Dawn Escapes Mediterranean Lavender, Bounty with Dawn, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray Apple Scent, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray Fresh Scent, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray Citrus Scent, Ultra Dawn Antibacterial Hand Soap Apple Blossom, Cascade Advanced Power Dishwasher Powder with Dawn, Dawn Ultra Gentle Clean Pomegranate And Rose Water, Ultra Dawn Platinum Bleach Alternative Morning Mist, Dawn Hand Renewal with Olay Cool Springs, Dawn Hand Renewal with Olay Refreshing Mint, Dawn Ultra Plus Hand Renewal Waterfall Mist, Dawn Professional Multi-Surface Heavy Duty Degreaser Concentrate, Mr. Clean Liquid Muscle Multi-Purpose Cleaner with the Power of Dawn, Dawn Professional Manual Pot and Pan Detergent Lemon Scent \u2013 Concentrate, Dawn Wash Away Bacteria Dishwashing Liquid Hand Soap Lemon, Dawn Platinum Bleach Alternative Dishwashing Liquid Fresh Rapids, and Dawn Platinum Bleach Stain Fighter Dishwashing Liquid, Lemon Burst\nNone of the documents listed any form of ammonia as part of Dawn products\u2019 composition or ingredients, which means it is false to assert that the dish cleaners contain the compound that causes a toxic gas when mixed with bleach. Additionally, it\u2019s false to claim that Dawn is nefariously putting ammonia in its products while omitting it from ingredient lists.\u00a0\nSupporting our analysis of the Safety Data Sheets, a representative\u00a0Proctor & Gamble, which owns the Dawn brand, told Snopes via email:\nDawn dish soap is not formulated using ammonia. That does not mean it should ever be combined with other cleaning products. In general, combining two cleaning products can cause harmful reactions, so like all cleaning products, we always recommend using Dawn by itself to get the job done.\u00a0\nPublic health officials ask people to heed similar advice in regards to DIY cleaning concoctions. The Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) states on its website: \u201cavoid mixing chemical products\u201d and \u201cnever mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser\u201d.\nIn sum, since mixing bleach and ammonia can be deadly, it\u2019s accurate to state that people should not combine Clorox bleach products with cleaners that contain ammonia; however, it is false to assert that Dawn dish soaps contain ammonia and/or that the company is nefariously leaving the compound off ingredient lists.

Nixon is perhaps best known for becoming the first president to resign, under the cloud of impeachment in 1974.But the parallels drawn in news stories were ones that the Nixon Foundation, the charitable organization founded by the 37th president, was eager to debunk. Taking to social media, the Nixon Foundation said that Stone had a minimal role in Nixon\u2019s campaigns for election and re-election in 1968 and 1972:Stone was charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office with seven counts, including lying to Congress, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering.

Their plan to make their plight public worked: soon after the Canadian news agency broke the story, the bank issued the family a new check, resolving the situation.TD Canada Trust spokeswoman Barbara Timmins assured us on 27 December 2017 that the family has received a replacement check and the situation has been resolved, saying: \u201cWe recognize that there was more we could have done to come to a resolution faster.\u201dMany of the headlines being shared by various publications seem geared to generate outrage clicks aimed at UPS, and are worded more or less like this one in the : \u201cAfter losing family\u2019s $846K inheritance, UPS offers to refund $32 shipping fee.\u201dIt is unclear why UPS should have been the target of outrage in this instance, as they didn\u2019t issue the check and had no authority or responsibility to provide a replacement. After searching unsuccessfully for the package, UPS sent the family a letter of apology and reimbursed their shipping costs, in accordance with the company\u2019s terms and conditions of service (which plainly state that customers are prohibited from shipping items worth more than $50,000). Furthermore, unless customers take specific actions to inform them, UPS employees usually have no way of knowing what is in packages they are delivering.In the CBC story, Herbert expressed remorse for having the money sent via UPS rather than picking it up himself, saying that \u201cI should have just driven [to the lawyer\u2019s office]. It\u2019s something I kick myself in the rear over everyday.\u201dIn response to the incident, UPS sent out a statement that read:Timmins said the case has illustrated that many people don\u2019t understand how bank drafts work. He noted that they do not expire and should be handled like cash in explaining why the bank was hesitant to reissue a new one after the original was lost:", "claim": "UPS lost a family's $846,000 inheritance check but would only refund them the $32 shipping fee.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

Many of the reports mentioned in this fact check, including the original Ihlayanews piece, used the same image, giving readers the clear impression that it showed Rwamirama:\n\nIn reality, that photograph was taken by the photographer Olivia Acland in the Democratic Republic of Congo and published by Reuters news agency in July 2019.

{"evidence": "In early May 2020, as the reported number of people infected by the COVID-19 coronavirus disease worldwide exceeded 1.2 million, people suspicious of the news media and politicians\u2019 portrayal of the pandemic began widely sharing social media posts that claimed Tanzania President John Magufuli sent non-human samples to a COVID-19 testing lab and they came back positive.\nAiming to sound the alarm on allegedly faulty testing practices, several of the posts included a photograph of Magufuli, smiling in a crowd of people, with text including: \u201c[He] has outsmarted somebody. He allowed coronavirus testing kits to be imported into his country. [\u2026] The tests were given human names and ages as they were sent off for results. They tested positive.\u201d\n\nNumerous people contacted Snopes to investigate the posts, including one person who identified as a resident of Tanzania, where the government has reported less than 500 COVID-19 patients and 16 deaths as a result of the virus. \u201cThis has created a lot of confusion among family and friends,\u201d the reader said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that people might actually refuse testing/avoid to be tested out of fear of getting infected,\u201d referring to the claim\u2019s suggestion that COVID-19 testing kits could be contaminated and that\u2019s why the non-human samples tested positive.\nFor our research, we first looked at where the claim about Magufuli originated. In televised remarks on May 3, the president said he was placing an order for an herbal tonic drink developed in Madagascar and touted as a cure for COVID-19 \u2014 despite the fact that there were no proven scientific remedies for the disease at the time of this writing. Rather, scientists and public health officials said the best way to stay healthy during the pandemic was to avoid exposure to the virus.\nOn May 4, 2020, BBC News published a story titled, \u201cCoronavirus: Tanzanian president promises to import Madagascar\u2019s \u2018cure.'\u201d Responding to the speech and news coverage, scientists and health officials \u2014 including those with the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2014 in the following days issued advisories against self-medicating with purported remedies for COVID-19. Among their concerns, scientists said the drink could drive resistance to malaria drugs. In an April 20 statement, which the scientific journal Science translated into English for Snopes\u2019 interpretation, the National Academy of Medicine of Madagascar said, \u201cIt is a drug whose scientific evidence has not yet been established, and which risks damaging the health of the population, in particular that of children.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how that is related to the claim in the above-displayed meme: Within the same televised statement, the president questioned the credibility of the national laboratory where lab technicians processed COVID-19 tests, essentially alleging that they were mishandling samples and the number of positive tests were exaggerated as a result. In a BBC News story about Magufuli\u2019s endorsement of the herbal drink, the news outlet translated the president\u2019s comments to English, stating:\nHe said he had secretly had some animals and fruits tested at the laboratory and that a papaya (paw-paw), a quail and a goat returned positive samples.\n\u201cThat means there is possibility for technical errors or these imported reagents have issues,\u201d he said, without giving more detail.\nThe following day, the Qatar-based Al Jazeera news network published a new story with the headline, \u201cTanzania COVID-19 lab head suspended as president questions data,\u201d including the president\u2019s claim regarding the fruit and animals.\nBut to better understand the potential motivation behind the Tanzanian president\u2019s assertions alleging nefarious testing, one must keep in mind the tension between the country\u2019s two main political groups \u2014 Magufuli\u2019s party in power and the opposition \u2014 as well as criticism of the president\u2019s handling of the pandemic unrelated to the claim.\nAt least one leader within the opposition party stood up for the national health laboratory despite Magufuli\u2019s assertions, describing the leader\u2019s suspension as \u201cpolitics\u201d interfering with his work, as outlined in the Al Jazeera piece. Additionally, the head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, defended the national health laboratory\u2019s practices. He told reporters, according to Reuters, \u201cThe tests that Tanzania is using, we know they are working very well.\u201d\nAlso, advocates for social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have criticized Magufuli\u2019s decision not to put the country on a lock down and his public statements encouraging people to gather in places of worship.\nIn sum, given the full context for why the Tanzanian president shared what he believed to be an example of faulty COVID-19 testing \u2014 a fruit, quail, and goat allegedly tested positive for the novel virus under the guise of being human specimens \u2014 and given the lack of any evidence apart from his own statements to support it, we rate this claim \u201cUnproven,\u201d with the significant caveat that Magufuli has gone against public health officials\u2019 advice for helping his residents overcome COVID-19 and the politically-charged climate surrounding the country\u2019s response.", "claim": "Tanzania President John Magufuli secretly sent specimens from a fruit, quail, and goat to a lab testing for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease in humans \u2014 and the results came back positive.

{"evidence": "In November 2019, the website MyColumbusPower published an article claiming that a \u201cnew STD superbug\u201d had the capacity to kill people within days and that health officials were worried that the incoming epidemic would be worse than AIDS:\nSTD Superbug May Be Deadlier Than AIDS; Kills Within Days\nThere is a new STD superbug that experts say may be more deadly than AIDS and could cause an epidemic.\nAccording to a report, an antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhea is more aggressive than AIDS, which means the potential to infect the public will be exponentially greater.\nThis article stirred up a considerable amount of concern on social media. However, this article was already several years old. Furthermore, the claim that there is an \u201cSTD superbug\u201d that is \u201cworse than AIDs\u201d can be traced back to a single quote from a single doctor and has been disputed by other medical professionals.\nArchived pages from the Internet Wayback Machine show that while the date on this MyColumbusPower article currently reads Nov. 7, 2019, this article has actually been on the site since at least September 2014. Furthermore, the information contained within is based on a CNBC report that was originally published in April 2013.\nCNBC quoted Alan Christianson, a doctor of naturopathic medicine, who was concerned about an antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhea called \u201cHO41\u201d that had been discovered in a woman in Japan.\u00a0\nThe news outlet reported:\nAn antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhea\u2014now considered a superbug\u2014has some analysts saying that the bacteria\u2019s effects could match those of AIDS.\n\u201cThis might be a lot worse than AIDS in the short run because the bacteria is more aggressive and will affect more people quickly,\u201d said Alan Christianson, a doctor of naturopathic medicine.\nEven though nearly 30 million people have died from AIDS related causes worldwide, Christianson believes the effect of the gonorrhea bacteria is more direct.\n\u201cGetting gonorrhea from this strain might put someone into septic shock and death in a matter of days,\u201d Christianson said. \u201cThis is very dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency situation,\u201d said William Smith, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. \u201cAs time moves on, it\u2019s getting more hazardous.\u201d\nWhile the above-quoted text did originate with a genuine news source, there are a few problems worth noting about this report.\u00a0\nFor one, as of this writing, six years after the CNBC article was originally published, there has not been an AIDS-level epidemic due to this gonorrhea strain. While health officials may have been concerned at the time, the claim that this strain was \u201cworse than AIDS\u201d has proved to be overstated.\u00a0\nThe CNBC article was also updated to note that \u201cthere have been no treatment failures reported in the U.S.for gonorrhea treated with currently-recommended first-line regimens.\u201d\nFurthermore, although CNBC quoted a doctor of naturopathic medicine saying that this strain of gonorrhea could be \u201cworse than AIDS,\u201d other medical professionals weighed in at the time to dispute this classification. Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., told Live Science that this was not a fair comparison:\nA recent CNBC article with the headline \u201cSex Superbug Could Be \u2018Worse Than AIDS'\u201d quoted Alan Christianson, a naturopathic doctor, as saying that an antibiotic-resistant strain of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea \u201cmight be a lot worse than AIDS in the short run because the bacteria is more aggressive and will affect more people quickly.\u201d\nHowever, some experts called the comparison hyperbolic.\n\u201cI disagree with the general comparison,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.\n\u201cThe rate of complications from gonorrhea in terms of systemic problems is so much lower than the rate of complications from untreated AIDS infection,\u201d Hirsch said.\nAlthough this strain of gonorrhea has not proven to be \u201cworse than AIDS\u201d and has not spurred any sort of epidemic, antibiotic-resistant strains of gonorrhea are a real and serious problem. Health officials have developed several ways to treat gonorrhea, but this disease has adapted over the years and is now resistant to many of them.\u00a0\nThe CDC told us in an email that gonorrhea has developed resistance to most treatments over the years. As of this writing, however, the disease can still be treated with antibiotics:\nIs the CDC worried about a new STD superbug epidemic?\nOver time, gonorrhea has developed resistance to all but one class of antibiotics. Half of all infections are resistant or demonstrate signs of emerging resistance to at least one antibiotic. Unfortunately tests for antibiotic resistance are not currently available to healthcare providers at the time of treatment. History shows us that it is only a matter of time before resistance outsmarts our last treatment \u2013 ceftriaxone. Based on laboratory and surveillance data, ceftriaxone remains an effective treatment in the U.S. There has not been a confirmed treatment failure in the U.S. using the recommended regimen. However, we are concerned as treatment failures have been identified outside the U.S., including in Canada. CDC estimates that over 1 million cases of gonorrhea occur each year. Reducing the overall number of gonorrhea cases might prevent or delay the development of resistance to ceftriaxone, and is a critical component.\n\u00b7Can gonorrhea still be treated with antibiotics?\nYes, gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics. CDC recommends using a regimen of dual therapy for the treatment of gonorrhea \u2013 the injectable ceftriaxone, plus oral azithromycin.\nThis video from the CDC explains how health officials are racing to find new drugs to treat gonorrhea as this disease becomes more resistant to antibiotics:\n\nLastly, it should be noted that when this MyColumbusPower article was shared on social media it was accompanied by a misleading image:\nThis is not an image of gonorrhea or an STD superbug.

Since its original posting, the status has received more than 12,000 shares:\nBenadryl might save a life: For anyone in Rattlesnake country: I have learned something new that I thought was important enough that I wanted to pass on. A man was bitten by a rattlesnake a few days ago. He was getting ready to bale and turned over a windrow to check the moisture and the snake was in it.\nIt wrapped around his arm and bit him on the underside of the wrist. Luckily it was not a severe bite, the fang marks were clear, but not deep enough to draw blood.\nHe came straight to the house and we got ice on it and had him to the hospital within an hour.\nI called ahead so the emergency room was ready for him.\nBy the time he got there his arm was starting to swell to the shoulder and his throat was getting tight.\nThe first thing the emergency room did was give him Benadryl.\nApparently antivenom must be received within 4 hours of the snakebite, but the immediate threat is swelling and death of tissue, which was treated with the Benadryl.\nBut there is no truth to this claim, according to an international group of doctors, paramedics, and scientists collectively known as the Snakebite Foundation.\n\u201cBenadryl is not effective for snake envenomations in humans or other animals. Please stop sharing this information. Antivenom along with proper supportive care are the only effective treatments supported by peer-reviewed literature,\u201d wrote Snakebite Foundation member Dr. Nick Brandehoff, an emergency physician and medical toxicologist at the University of California, San Francisco at Fresno, in a blog post.\nRattlesnake venom is made up of a variety of peptides and proteins described in the scientific journal Chemical Ecology as a \u201cmultifunctional cocktail\u201d that, once injected into the bloodstream, can cause harmful neurotoxic and inflammatory issues. In particular, rattlesnake venom contains two neurotoxins that can lead to pain, paralysis, tissue necrosis, and in extreme cases death.\nTo treat bites from pit vipers and other venomous snakes, the World Health Organization strictly advises the use of antivenoms, which work by boosting a patient\u2019s immune response. Antivenoms are produced by harvesting snake venom and then using it to immunize donor animals such as horses and sheep. Antibodies from these animals are then harvested and purified from plasma that can \u201cliterally make a difference between life and death.\u201d\nAn allergy, on the other hand, is an immune response to allergens that releases chemicals known as histamines. These are treated with antihistamines like Benadryl, more commonly known as diphenhydramine, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. In some cases, American Family Physician notes that antihistamines may be used to treat anaphylaxis, which the Journal of Wilderness Medicine reports has been known to result from a rattlesnake bite, in conjunction with epinephrine.\n\u201cComparing bee venom and snake venom to assume Benadryl will work is not congruent. Bee venom specially targets cells causing [the] release of histamine which results in swelling, pain, redness, and allergic reactions. This is similar to the pathway for non-venom induced allergic reactions,\u201d wrote Brandehoff, highlighting that snake venom works \u201cvia different mechanisms.\u201d\nIn the event of a rattlesnake bite, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends seeking medical attention as soon as possible.\u00a0", "claim": "The common allergy drug Benadryl can be used to treat rattlesnake bites.

The company utilized its database of over 20 billion online historical records to form Hanks\u2019 family tree, the representative said.\nWe have no reason to doubt Ancestry.com\u2019s claim. However, some readers may not quite understand just how distant a distant cousin really is.\u00a0\nThe genealogy website reported that Rogers and Hanks are sixth cousins who share a 5x great-grandfather (or a great-great-great-great-great-grandfather). Here\u2019s how Ancestry.com described Hanks relationship to Rogers:\u00a0\n\nFred Rogers and Tom Hanks are sixth cousins sharing the same 5x great-grandfather, Johannes Mefford, who immigrated from Germany to America in the 18th century. Johannes raised a family of patriots; three of his sons (including Tom Hanks\u2019 and Fred Rogers\u2019s ancestors) served in the Revolutionary War. Fred Rogers\u2019s 4x great-grandfather, William Mefford, served in the navy and was captured by the British in 1782. He endured life on a prison ship in Barbados and Antigua until he was released ten months later. Tom Hanks\u2019s 4x great-grandfather, Jacob Mefford, joined the War as a private and participated in a skirmish at Chesapeake Bay. So, Rogers and Hanks not only share the same ancestor, they also descend from two brothers who fought for America\u2019s independence.\nWhile it may be \u201ctrue\u201d to say that Hanks and Rogers are related, phrasing their relationship this way is a bit misleading.\u00a0\nWe found varying estimates about just how closely related sixth cousins really are, but the general conclusion was that these \u201crelatives\u201d were very distant.

{"evidence": "In April 2020, reports started to circulate\u00a0that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) had provided the Wuhan Institute of Virology a $3.7 million grant in 2015, while former U.S. President Obama was still in office. These reports were often accompanied by the evidence-free suggestion that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 had \u201cescaped\u201d from this lab and the insinuation that, since this lab reportedly received funding from the Obama administration, the pandemic was therefore Obama\u2019s fault.\nThis claim received widespread attention on April 17 when a reporter from the conservative outlet Newsmax asked President Donald Trump about it during a White House press briefing.\n.@realDonaldTrump responds to @EmeraldRobinson's query about a $3.7 million grant the U.S. gave to a Wuhan lab tied to COVID-19's origins.\n\\\"We will end that grant very quickly\u2026 It was made a number of years ago [2015].

There\u2019s also another report that the NIH under the Obama administration in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?\u201d\nTrump responded: \u201cThe Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million. I\u2019ve been hearing about that. And we\u2019ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area we\u2019re looking at it, literally about an hour ago, also early in the morning, we will end that grant very quickly. But it was granted quite awhile ago. They were granted a substantial amount of money.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack there, so let\u2019s start with the basic claim:\nDid the Obama administration grant $3.7 million to the Wuhan Institute of Virology?\nBetween 2014 and 2019, the EcoHealth Alliance was awarded a series of grants totaling approximately $3.7 million by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (a division of the National Institutes of Health) to study the \u201crisk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China.\u201d Only a portion of this money has been used to fund research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, however, and approximately $700,000 of this grant money was awarded under the Trump administration.\nDespite having a grain of truth at its core, the claim that the Obama administration gave a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology is therefore misleading at best. It first gained prominence on April 11, 2020, on the heels of an article published in the Daily Mail. The British tabloid claimed that it had obtained documents showing that coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been funded by a $3.7 million grant from the U.S. government:\n\u201cDocuments obtained by The Mail on Sunday show the Wuhan Institute of Virology undertook coronavirus experiments on mammals captured more than 1,000 miles away in Yunnan \u2013 funded by a $3.7 million grant from the US government.\u201d\nThe Daily Mail did not provide links or screenshots to these documents.

It\u2019s also true that this paper was partially funded by money granted by the National Institutes of Health. However, when we followed up using the grant number listed in the funding section of the paper (NIAID R01AI110964), we found that the NIH did not directly issue this series of grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System (TAGGS) shows that NIAID R01AI110964 was awarded to the EcoHealth Alliance for \u201cunderstanding the risk of bat coronavirus emergence.\u201d Between 2014 and 2019, this global environmental health nonprofit organization received a total of $3.7 million from NIH:\n\nWhile a portion of these grants funded research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, this lab did not receive all $3.7 million. Under award number NIAID R01AI110964, NIH also funded studies produced by institutions in the United States, Australia, and Singapore, and the work involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology was an international collaboration with the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance.\nFurthermore, while these funds were originally appropriated by the NIH in 2014 during the Obama administration, the most recent payment, in 2019, was authorized by the Trump administration. The payments record in the above-displayed image from the Department of Health and Human Services show that the EcoHealth Alliance filed \u201cNoncompeting Continuation\u201d applications in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. In 2019, however, the organization filed a renewal application (previously called a \u201ccompeting continuation\u201d). This renewal application was awarded by the NIH under Trump\u2019s administration.\nHere\u2019s how NIH defines these two different types of grant applications:\nRenewal: Initial request for additional funding for a period subsequent to that provided by a current award. Renewal applications compete for funding with all other peer reviewed applications and must be developed as fully as though the applicant is applying for the first time. (Previously referred to as \u201ccompeting continuation.\u201d)\nNoncompeting Continuation: Request or award for a subsequent budget period within a previously approved project for which a recipient does not have to compete with other applications.\nAlthough the initial grant was approved under the Obama administration in 2014, EcoHealth Alliance\u2019s renewal application was approved by the Trump administration in 2019.\u00a0\nIt should also be noted that these grants were not awarded to fund a laboratory. They were awarded to fund research into how bat coronavirus could emerge and spread to human populations. The purpose of this kind of research, spurred into action by the 2002 SARS outbreak, is to understand the process of how coronaviruses become transmissible to humans. That earlier outbreak was also caused by a coronavirus linked to bats.\nIs it unusual for the United States to fund research in other countries?\u00a0\nIn short, no. While this claim is often circulated as if the Obama administration did something unusual, or even nefarious, by awarding a series of grants that would subsequently fund research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the United States routinely provides funding to international research organizations. In fact, records show that the NIH has provided approximately $2.5 million in additional funding to various organizations in China (including Wuhan University) in 2018 and 2019, under the Trump administration. In 2007, while George W. Bush was president, NIH provided more than $2 million to various research centers across China.\u00a0\nFurthermore, international organizations often come together to solve problems that could impact the global population, such as pandemic. In 2003, for instance, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on countries around the world to develop a diagnostic test for SARS.\u00a0\nOn 17 March 2003, WHO called upon 11 laboratories in 9 countries to join a collaborative multi-center research project on SARS diagnosis. This network takes advantage of modern communication technologies (e-mail; secure web site) to share outcomes of investigation of clinical samples from SARS cases in real time. Daily assessment of research results supports immediate refinement of investigative strategies and permits instant validation of laboratory findings. Network members share on the secure WHO web site electron microscopic pictures of viruses, sequences of genetic material for virus identification and characterization, virus isolates, various samples from patients and post-mortem tissues. Samples from one and the same patient can be analysed in parallel in several laboratories and results shared in real time. This network joins the intellectual resources of leading laboratories worldwide for a common goal: the detection of the SARS agent and the development of a diagnostic test.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a similar call to action:\nWhile political leaders have locked their borders, scientists have been shattering theirs, creating a global collaboration unlike any in history. Never before, researchers say, have so many experts in so many countries focused simultaneously on a single topic and with such urgency. Nearly all other research has ground to a halt", "claim": "The Obama administration provided a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "On March 6, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump traveled to Tennessee to meet with local officials, residents, and first-responders as he surveyed the damage from a deadly tornado that killed at least 25 people statewide. The following day, a rumor holding that Trump had pulled out his personal checkbook during this visit to give money to tornado victims started to go viral on Facebook:\nThis Facebook post was shared close to 20,000 times within a few days of its initial posting. The text of the message was also copied and pasted by several additional social media accounts. The copypasta text reads:\nSo Trump comes to Nashville to oversee damage from the tornado. He flies into the area in a helicopter to get there without further traffic problems in the city. He writes PERSONAL checks to those in need, with his personal accountant in tow. No other President in history has done this. Then, he poses beside a Jeep. Now let\u2019s hear all those Cherokee owners gawk!!!\nThere is no evidence to support these claims. We have not encountered any news articles about Trump writing personal checks to tornado victims, nor any videos or photographs capturing such a moment.\u00a0\nFurthermore, this post claims that Trump had his \u201cpersonal accountant in tow\u201d during the visit. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. Trump was accompanied on his trip to Nashville with members of the state\u2019s delegation, including Republican Senators Marsha Blackburn and Lamar Alexander, but we found no mentions of an \u201caccountant\u201d tagging along on this trip.\u00a0Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal accountant\u201d likely refers to Allen Weisselberg, the Trump family\u2019s longtime accountant and the current chief financial officer of The Trump Organization, but Weisselberg did not accompany Trump on this trip to Tennessee.\u00a0\nThe Facebook post also gets details about Trump\u2019s method of travel wrong. While Trump did take Marine One, the presidential helicopter, to get an aerial view of the damage and to travel to Cookeville, Tennessee, he actually traveled to Nashville via Air Force One.\u00a0\u00a0\nA photograph supposedly showing Trump in Nashville after he \u201cgot his check book out and just started writing\u201d was also spread on social media:\n\nThis photograph, however, does not show Trump during his visit to Nashville in March 2020. This image actually comes from Trump\u2019s trip to Alabama in March 2019 after a tornado left 23 people dead. Contemporary news reports made no mention of Trump writing personal checks to to tornado victims during this trip, either.\u00a0\nIt should be noted that Trump has donated his presidential salary to various causes since he took office. While the Trump administration has made public announcements concerning these donations, no such statement has been released about Trump allegedly writing personal checks to tornado victims in Nashville. In March 2020, it was announced that Trump would be donating to\u00a0the Department of Health and Human Services To help \u201cconfront, contain, and combat coronavirus.\u201d\u00a0\nWe reached out to the White House and Kirby Pearce, the apparent author of the viral Facebook post, for comment. We will update this article if more information becomes available.\u00a0\nThis rumor did not originate with a credible source, nor was it accompanied by any supporting evidence.

{"evidence": "In April 2019, a video supposedly showing a chicken being hypnotized went viral on social media:\nThis is a genuine, unaltered video of a chicken reacting to a line being drawn in the sand directly in front of it. However, while this practice is often described as \u201chypnosis,\u201d Dimitrios Beredimas, an agronomist and blogger at Strange Animals, noted that it would be more accurate to say that this chicken is in a state of \u201ctonic immobility.\u201d\nThis video appears to have originated on the Insane Monkey YouTube page. That version was accompanied by the following description:\nThis video shows you how it really works by drawing a single line in front of a chicken or a rooster and they become hypnotized almost instantly and will not move until the line is gone. This really works and i have done it many times and so have all my neighbors and family who have chickens and roosters.\nWhile many people may be seeing this chicken hypnotism video for the first time, this behavior has been acknowledged since at least 1648, when it was mentioned in \u201cArs Magna Lucis et Umbrae\u201d (\u201cThe Great Art of Light and Shadow\u201d) by Athanasius Kircher, a German Jesuit scholar:\n\nSo what\u2019s happening here? The video shows a chicken entering a catatonic-type state after experiencing a \u201cfear-potentiated response\u201d to a line drawn in the sand. This animal behavior is called \u201c\u2018tonic immobility,\u201d but readers may be more familiar with the colloquial terms \u201cplaying dead\u201d or \u201cplaying possum.\u201d\u00a0 While this is typically a defensive mechanism, Beredimas notes that the chicken isn\u2019t particularly good at pretending to be dead:\nThis strange animal behaviour is officially called \u2018tonic immobility\u2019, a natural state of semi-paralysis that many animals exhibit when under threat. Commonly known as apparent death, playing dead and playing possum, this state serves as a defensive mechanism\u00a0as most predators prefer live prey.\nIn chickens, this is most probably a vestigial trait as it doesn\u2019t seem to have a useful purpose. The chicken doesn\u2019t make a good job hiding the fact it\u2019s still alive. Its obvious that is breathing and we can see some eye movement and blinking.\nSince this phenomenon may be new to city folk, let\u2019s take a look at a few other videos showcasing this technique:\nIf you have access to a chicken and want to try this, the Strange Animals blog provided the following instructions:\nThe trick is quite simple. All you have to do is hold the chicken\u2019s head down against the ground, and draw a straight line using a stick, your finger, a piece of chalk or whatever.\nThe line should start at the beak and extend straight outwards, in front of the chicken. If done properly, the chicken \u2014 or rooster \u2014 will be put into a state of trance and lie still for anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes! To de-hypnotize the chicken, just clap your hands or give it a gentle push. It may take a few tries to awaken the bird.\nThis isn\u2019t the only way to hypnotize a chicken. Other methods include swirling your finger in a circle around the birds head or tucking its head underneath its wing. The latter method was briefly mentioned in Ernest Hemingway\u2019s posthumous 1985 book, \u201cThe Dangerous Summer\u201c:\nYou can lay the chicken down with its head still under its wing and it will lie, hypnotized, for an hour or more or until you wake it. It was a parlor trick that had much success in East Africa. Sometimes I would have a dozen chickens lying asleep in a row on the porch of some native hut in a village under Kilimanjaro when we needed something badly and it was necessary to make magic to obtain it.\nWhile Hemingway may be taking some artistic license with his \u201can hour or more\u201d sentence, and although this trick isn\u2019t guaranteed to work on all breeds of chicken, the above-displayed viral video showcases a technique to \u201chypnotize\u201d chickens that has been used for centuries.\u00a0", "claim": "A video shows a chicken being hypnotized by holding its head down and \"drawing\" a line in the sand extending from its beak.

But that\u2019s exactly what happened to former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on the presidential campaign trail, according to one quote meme:\n\nIn this case the meme is accurate. While speaking at a town hall event in Des Moines, Iowa, hosted by the Asian & Latino Coalition on Aug. 8, 2019, Biden let slip with a statement that \u201cpoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids,\u201d thereby implying that economically disadvantaged persons are all non-white.\nThe unfortunate remark by Biden was reported on by The New York Times and captured on video:\nFormer Vice President Joseph R.

{"evidence": "In mid-February 2019, an image supposedly showing an enormous snake being held up by a crane started to circulate on social media. Attached to photograph was the claim that the super-sized serpent had been found by a plumber who was investigating a clog:Ric Bauer told us via Facebook that he didn\u2019t have any first-hand knowledge of the incident behind the picture and that he was merely re-sharing an image he had encountered on another Facebook page, \u201cKey West in Your Face.\u201d The Key West page made no mention of a plumber or a clog, however, and Bauer told us that he had reposted the image with his own caption: \u201cFlorida Plumber Finds Clog.\u201dIn other words, the \u201cplumber\u201d portion of this claim did not originate with a news report or first-hand knowledge, but apparently as a joke.We have not been able to track down the exact origins of this photograph, but we have found a number of people who shared this same picture as if the snake had been found in a variety of locations. An 11 February 2019 post on the web forum , for example, reported that this snake was found in Mississippi: \u201cA place in Enterprise, Mississippi where a friend works was having serious \u201cclogging\u201d problems with the \u201coutflow\u201d of their plumbing. This morning they found this.\u201dOther Facebook users stated that the snake was found in various Florida cities, including Plant City and Immokalee.

On 9 February 2019, Facebook user Sherri Blair posted this image and claimed that the snake was found in New Orleans East:The fact that this single photograph has been attached to a multiple locations indicates that those sharing this image do not know its true origins.

{"evidence": "In June 2020, a specious rumor started circulating on social media about how Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s great-grandfather was a slave owner who fought in the Confederate Army. There was no truth to this claim. This rumor was circulated in the form of a meme that included a photograph of a Confederate soldier named Richard Young Bennett (no relation to Biden), misidentified the former vice president\u2019s great grandfather as \u201cJoseph J. Biden\u201d (Biden\u2019s actual paternal great grandfather was George T. Biden), and baselessly claimed that this fictional person was a Confederate soldier and slave owner.\nWhile that rumor was, and still is, false, it did cause some social media users to dig through Biden\u2019s family history to see if there were any familial links to slavery. In August 2020, we received a tip that Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather, a man by the name of Thomas Herbert Randle, was a slave owner.\u00a0\nThe claim that Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather owned a slave is based on genealogy records from websites such as Ancestry.com and a slave schedule \u2014 a form used in the years 1850 and 1860 to enumerate the number of African American slaves on the U.S. Census.\nWe do not doubt that Biden had a great-great-great grandfather named Thomas Herbert Randle, and we see no reason to be suspicious of the 1850 slave schedule listing a Thomas H. Randle who recorded owning a 14-year-old Black slave. However, the question remains if these two listings refer to the same individual.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ve been able to gather so far.\nWho Was Biden\u2019s Great-Great-Great Grandfather?\u00a0\nAccording to genealogy sites such as Wikitree, Geni.com, geneanet.org, and wargs.com, a website that traces the ancestry of United States presidents and political figures, Biden had a great-great-great grandfather named Thomas Herbert Randle.\u00a0\u00a0\nRandle was born in Baltimore County, Maryland, circa 1803, and would go on to marry a woman named Mary Ann Shoemaker. Randle, a farmer, had two children (at least), named William Thomas and Lydia Ann, the latter of whom married Joseph H. Biden.\nLydia and Joseph H. Biden had a child named George, who had a child named Joseph, who had a child named Joseph, who had a child that would become the vice president of the United States. In other words, Thomas Herbert Randle is former VP\u00a0 Biden\u2019s father\u2019s (Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr.) father\u2019s (Joseph H. Biden) father\u2019s (George T. Biden) father\u2019s (Joseph H. Biden) wife\u2019s (Lydia Ann Biden) father (Thomas Herbert Randle), making him Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather.\u00a0\nWho Was Slave Owner Thomas H. Randle?\u00a0\nAccording to the Maryland State Archives\u2019 \u201cLegacy of Slavery\u201d database, a \u201cThomas H. Randle\u201d from Baltimore County reported owning a 14-year-old Black male slave in the 1850 federal census:\nWe accessed this record via Ancestry.com, and can confirm that a Thomas H. Randle is truly listed on this 1850 slave schedule. Randle is not listed as a slave owner in 1860.\nThis document also provides no additional information about Randle other than his name, and no information about the 14-year-old slave other than their age and gender. The only additional information we could glean comes from the title of this document, which reads: \u201cSchedule 2 \u2013 Recorded slave inhabitants in 1st district in the county of Baltimore state of Maryland, enumerated by me, on the 16th day of August 1850.\u201d The document was signed by a \u201cSamuel Storm.\u201d\nIs Biden\u2019s Great-Great-Great Grandfather the Same Thomas Randle Listed on This 1850 Slave Schedule?\nThere\u2019s a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests that these two Randles are indeed one and the same. For instance, both men share the same first and last name, as well as the middle initial. Census information for Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather also lists him as a farmer, an occupation that was known to use slavery for tasks such as tending crops, doing household chores, and gardening.\u00a0\nIn the 1850 census, a Thos. H. Randle is listed as living in Baltimore\u2019s 1st district. This is the same year and district listed in the aforementioned slave schedule. The Thos. listed here appears to be Biden\u2019 great great great grandfather. In addition to having the same name (Thos. is an abbreviation for Thomas), this person was also born circa 1803 and is listed alongside a \u201cMary A\u201d (presumably Randle\u2019s wife) and a \u201cLydia\u201d (presumably Randle\u2019s daughter).\nIn other words, Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather was named Thomas H. Randle, and in 1850, he lived in Baltimore\u2019s 1st district. This is the same name and the same district listed in the 1850 slave schedule of a man who owned a 14-year-old Black slave.\u00a0\nHere are the relevant documents: 1850 Slave Schedule / 1850 U.S. Census.\u00a0\nWhile this evidence may seem convincing, we can\u2019t say with certainty that these two Randles were indeed one and the same.\nFor starters, we simply don\u2019t have any information about the Randle listed on the 1850 slave schedule (such as his age or family members) that would help us definitively connect him to Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather. We also found a few examples of other Thomas Randles (or Randols, or Randalls, or Randells \u2014 misspelled names were common on the census) living in Maryland around this period. While these Randles were not listed for Baltimore County\u2019s 1st district in 1850, the fact that there were other Randle families living in this area opens up the possibility that the Randle on the slave schedule was a different person than Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also possible that some of the census information contained errors, or that the census records we examined were not complete. For instance, a 1958 news article from The Baltimore Sun mentioned a \u201cJustice Thomas H. Randle,\u201d but we have been unable to connect this Randle to any census records.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat About the 1860 Slave Schedule?\nThe U.S. Census enumerated African American slaves on \u201cslave schedules\u201d in both 1850 and 1860. While the 1850 slave schedule listed a \u201cThomas H. Randle,\u201d this name is not found in 1860. We did find a record for a \u201cThomas Randal\u201d and, as we noted earlier, spelling mistakes were common in the U.S. Census so it\u2019s possible that these two listings refer to the same individual.\nHowever, the location of these listings changes between 1850 and 1860. In 1850, the slave schedule noted that a \u201cThomas H. Randle\u201d owned a 14-year-old Black slave in the 1st district of Baltimore County. This is the same district that Thomas Herbert Randle, Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather, lived in according to the 1850 U.S. Census. In 1860, however, the slave schedule notes that \u201cThomas Randall\u201d owned a 5-year-old Black female slave in the 8th district of Anne Arundel County. According to the U.S. Census, Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather was not living in this location in 1860. On the census, Thomas Herbert Randle\u2019s location is listed as the 13th district of Baltimore County.\nDid Biden\u2019s Great-Great-Great Grandfather Have Servants?\nWhile we can\u2019t definitively say that Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather owned a slave in 1850, we can say with relative certainty that this person had servants. U.S. Census records from 1860 show that Thomas H. Randle had two \u201cservants\u201d named Peggy and Delia Malters, both Black women in their 40s. A 19-year-old Black \u201cfarm laborer\u201d named Richard Savoy was also listed under Randle\u2019s name. It should be noted that this document lists \u201cfree inhabitants\u201d in the 13th district in Baltimore County, Maryland:\nWe don\u2019t know the specific conditions about the relationships that these individuals had with Randle. While the people listed on this document were identified as \u201cfree inhabitants,\u201d and while they may not have legally been considered slaves, people considered servants in the 1860s did not have the same freedoms as regular laborers.\nPBS described the difference between an indentured servant and a slave as follows:\nServants typically worked four to seven years in exchange for passage, room, board, lodging and freedom dues. While the life of an indentured servant was harsh and restrictive, it wasn\u2019t slavery. There were laws that protected some of their rights. But their life was not an easy one, and the punishments meted out to people who wronged were harsher than those for non-servants. An indentured servant\u2019s contract could be extended as punishment for breaking a law, such as running away, or in the case of female servants, becoming pregnant.\nRandle\u2019s daughter Lydia is not listed in the above-displayed image from the 1860 Census because by this time she had already married Joseph Biden (who spelled his name Byden). Lydia can be seen listed here alongside Joseph in the 1860 census.\u00a0\nTo Sum Things Up:\u00a0\n2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather Thomas Herbert Randle was a farmer who was born circa 1803 in Maryland. Randle, whose daughter Lydia would marry Biden\u2019s great-great grandfather, Joseph H. Biden, lived in Baltimore County\u2019s 1st District in 1850, according to U.S. Census Records. A slave schedule from this same year and district lists a \u201cThomas H. Randle\u201d as owning a 14-year-old Black slave.\nHowever, this slave schedule provides no additional information about the listed Randle (such as age or familial relations) that would allow us to definitively say that they are the same person, and we can\u2019t rule out the possibility that the \u201cThomas H. Randle\u201d listed on the 1850 slave schedule is a different person than the \u201cThos. H. Randle\u201d listed on the 1850 U.S. Census.\u00a0\nIt should also be noted that there wasn\u2019t a Thomas H. Randle listed on the slave schedule in 1860. There was a \u201cThomas Randal,\u201d but the location listed on this slave schedule does not match the location listed for Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather in the U.S. Census in 1860. This may indicate that the slave-owning Randle was indeed a different person than Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather. Or, it could be entirely unrelated to the 1850 listing.\u00a0\nWhile we can\u2019t say for sure if\u00a0Biden\u2019s great-great-great grandfather owned a slave in 1850, he did list having two Black servants and a Black farm laborer on the 1860 U.S. Census.\u00a0 According to the census, however, these three individuals were considered \u201cfree inhabitants.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Biden\u2019s campaign for comment, but have yet to hear a response.

{"evidence": "On 10 March 2019,   reported that the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) was considering leveraging people\u2019s social media accounts to determine the veracity of their disability claims:The story resulted in spin-offs from various publications including  (\u201cHow a Trump Proposal Could Reduce \u2018Happy\u2019 Disabled People\u201d) and the Daily Kos website (\u201cTrump administration seeks to monitor social media of disability recipients, including vets\u201d). As with any story that sounds far-fetched, Snopes.com readers queried whether the story could be believed.It is true that SSA\u00a0proposed using social media posts in making disability determinations. The proposal was put forward in its fiscal year 2020 budget request, noting (on page 26) that the agency wants to take a more proactive approach in looking at people\u2019s posts on the platforms. Whereas social media posts can currently come into play in fraud investigations, the practice could be expanded, per the budget request:(CDI refers to the Cooperative Disability Investigations unit and is responsible for working in conjunction with various agencies to \u201cinvestigate suspicious disability claims under SSA\u2019s Title II and Title XVI disability Programs.\u201d)In a statement emailed to Snopes, agency spokesman Darren Lutz said SSA is studying strategies of \u201cother agencies and private entities to determine how social media might be used to evaluate disability applications\u201d but declined to provide further details.Although neither   nor  articles mentioned veterans, the Daily Kos website cited a tweet posted by writer Dylan Park that introduced the idea that veterans could also be targets of such investigations.\nIn that same post, Park recounts having benefits cut for telling a medical professional he was feeling \u201cfine\u201d in one visit, despite having post-traumatic stress disorder from his experiences on the battlefield.\nThe SSA and Veterans Administration (VA) run separate benefits programs for adjudicating and dispersing disability benefits. But the two programs can overlap, meaning a disabled veteran can receive benefits from both agencies\u00a0simultaneously. We sent questions to SSA asking how investigating social media posts could impact veterans receiving SSA disability payments but got no answer by the time of publication.The SSA hasn\u2019t yet offered specifics on how it might use social media in evaluating disability claims. But writing for , Imani Barbarin, who has cerebral palsy and is an advocate for the disabled community, observed that the policy could backfire by mistakenly rejecting people from the program. She noted that such a proposal demonstrates a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding\u201d of disability and how a social media post made by a disabled person could easily be misconstrued.\u201cDisabled people don\u2019t all function in the same way, and disability is not a set of stereotypes like taking selfies staring longingly at the world. They live lives while managing their energy for the activities they can handle and trying to make those they cannot more accessible,\u201d Barbarin wrote. \u201cAdditionally, studies have shown that a majority of social media users show only the good in their lives, not the hardships or difficulties.\u201dPerusing people\u2019s social media posts is already a common practice by private insurance companies determining coverage or investigating claims. But the prospect of the U.S. government adopting the practice to evaluate applications has raised a number of concerns among privacy advocates and advocates for the disabled community, as CBS News reported:Furthermore as CBS reports, \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine how federal disability examiners could even authenticate profiles to evaluate applicants for disability. Social media profiles aren\u2019t tied to Social Security numbers, for example, and many users set their profiles to private, preventing strangers from viewing them.\u201d", "claim": "The Trump Administration is seeking to monitor social media posts of disability recipients.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}
{"evidence": "In the summer of 2017, reports emerged that the administration of President Donald Trump had reversed existing plans to enhance protections for certain marine animals off the West Coast of the United States.\u00a0On 12 June 2017, the  published an article with the headline \u201cTrump cancels whale and sea turtle protections,\u201d which was shared more than 62,000 times on Facebook and read:The decision has continued to cause concern among some observers throughout the ensuing 12 months, and enjoyed a resurgence of online attention in July 2018.The  article, unlike\u00a0other\u00a0more comprehensive (but less widely shared)\u00a0reports from June 2017, contained a mix of accurate statements and incomplete or misleading characterizations of the decision made at that time.In 2015, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council recommended to the National Marine Fisheries Service (which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA) that they introduce \u201chard caps\u201d on the number of marine mammals, including whales and sea turtles, that could be \u201ctaken\u201d (i.e., caught up in fishing nets) in a particular type of fishing along the West Coast.The fishery in question involves around 20 vessels, mainly targets swordfish off the coast of California, and uses a method called \u201cdrift gillnet\u201d (DGN) fishing, which involves wide mesh nets lowered under the surface of the water to passively catch the target fish as they move into the paths of the nets.\u00a0Because of the passive nature of this fishing method (which literally involves casting a very wide net), other species are sometimes inadvertently caught up and killed and then thrown back into the sea. This process is known as \u201cbycatch.\u201dUnder the 2015 proposal, if the bycatch met or exceeded a certain level, the entire fishery of 20 vessels would be shut down for at least the remainder of that fishing season.The fisheries service drafted a proposed new rule (RIN 0648-BG23) based on these recommendations, then oversaw a period of consultation and consideration of alternatives to the proposal, its potential impacts, and so on \u2014 a process known as a \u201cregulatory impact review.\u201d This process is standard practice in federal agencies across government departments\u00a0when considering a possible change to regulations. Some proposals are ultimately adopted, and others are not.\u00a0In the end, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council, which advises and guides regulatory actions and policy-making by the fisheries service, recommended implementing the hard caps. However, the fisheries service disagreed and in May 2017 decided not to implement the proposed rule.Michael Milstein, a spokesperson for the fisheries service, told us that it is \u201csomewhat unusual\u201d for the fisheries service to go against the recommendations of the Pacific Fisheries Management Council but explained the rationale behind the decision, which was ultimately overseen by Barry Thom, regional administrator for the NOAA Fisheries west coast region.According to Milstein, during the 1970s and 1980s, non-target species, including some animals designated as protected and even endangered, were being entangled in drift gillnets used for commercial swordfish and shark fishing\u00a0\u2014 hundreds per year at one point. \u201cHistorically, there was a clear problem,\u201d he told us.In response to this, the fisheries service set up task forces known as \u201ctake reduction teams,\u201d composed of scientists and fishermen, whose function was to find ways to reduce the number of animals being entangled and killed in commercial fishing.\u00a0Along the West Coast, the take reduction team came up with several ways to minimize and mitigate against the unintended bycatch resulting from drift gillnet fishing, including \u201cpingers\u201d and \u201cnet extenders.\u201d According to Milstein, these innovations have dramatically reduced the number of non-target species being entangled in drift gillnets:Milstein also pointed to the protected areas that have been established off the west coast, in which drift gillnet fishing has been banned entirely, in order to protect sea turtles in particular.\u00a0Milstein\u2019s assertion is supported by scientific evidence. A NOAA technical memorandum published in January 2017 found that acoustic pingers, in particular, had driven major declines in the level of bycatch among several species of whales, dolphins,\u00a0and turtles, since the mid-to-late 1990s. Among some species, in particular the beaked whale, bycatch has been close to eliminated.\u00a0For this reason, Milstein told us, the fisheries service decided that the potential benefits of imposing a hard cap on bycatch numbers, which were already low and declining, were outweighed by the potential economic damage done to the fishery, if it were to be shut down:Some environmental activists have rejected this rationale. Catherine Kilduff, a lawyer for the Center for Biological Diversity, told the Associated Press in June 2017 that even relatively small numbers of deaths can have an outsized impact on communities of endangered species. \u201cIf they catch one, it\u2019s a huge problem for the population,\u201d she argued.\u00a0Milstein said the potential economic damage caused to some fishermen by shutting down the entire fishery would be \u201chard for them to bear,\u201d and suggested such an outcome would be especially unfair for those fishermen who were \u201cdoing everything right\u201d and properly implementing existing take reduction measures.In their final ruling on the proposal in May 2017, the fisheries service wrote:In particular, the fisheries service indicated that the economic costs to a fisherman of a one or two-season closure could force them into alternative employment altogether, and if that were not available to them, these short-term costs could easily escalate into long-term economic damage if the hard caps were implemented.\u00a0The \u2018s headline \u2014 \u201cTrump cancels whale and sea turtle protections\u201d\u00a0\u2014 was misleading. First, the decision was not taken by President Trump himself, but rather was overseen by NOAA Fisheries West Coast regional administrator Barry Thom, after an extensive period of consultation and a standard regulatory impact review. Thom was appointed\u00a0to the post in October 2016, during the administration of President Barack Obama.\u00a0Second, the headline could give rise to the impression that President Trump (or his administration) had terminated  protections for whales and sea turtles or had actively unraveled existing protections. This was not the case, as we have explained. Several protections, proven to be effective, remain in place.And finally, the article described the May 2017 decision as a \u201crule change,\u201d but in fact it was the opposite. What had been proposed was a new rule, not a change, and the fisheries service\u2019s decision simply meant that that new rule would not be implemented, keeping in place the status quo.", "claim": "In June 2017, President Donald Trump canceled federal protections for whales and sea turtles", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}

School superintendents across the country were dismayed by President Donald Trump\u2019s push to reopen schools despite the health risks of doing so, and after Education Secretary Betsy DeVos gave an interview with CNN in July 2020 during which she reiterated the administration\u2019s goal, one statement attributed to her began making the internet rounds.\nSnopes readers asked us if DeVos actually said, \u201cYou can\u2019t plan for something that hasn\u2019t happened yet,\u201d in response to a question about what would happen if a school had a COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe following image reproducing that alleged statement was widely shared on Facebook:\n\nThe statement appeared to be a highly paraphrased version of what DeVos said during her July 12 interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. We watched the 21-minute interview and found that Devos\u2019 response at roughly the 17:44 mark appears to be what was referenced in the meme. In answering Bash\u2019s questions, Devos often went in circles, hedged, or sidestepped providing direct responses. She did not use the exact words presented in the meme, and although she did say something similar, it was in a different context than that offered in the meme.\nDuring the interview, Bash persistently queried DeVos about what school districts should do in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak in the classroom, and a transcript of part of that exchange reads as follows:\nBash: I am asking you ma\u2019am, as Secretary of Education, if there is a flare-up [of COVID-19], should schools revert to remote learning?\nDeVos: I think the go-to needs to be kids in school, in person, in the classroom, because we know for most kids that\u2019s the best environment for them \u2026\nBash: [interrupts] I understand that, but what if they can\u2019t?\nDeVos: What if they can\u2019t what?\nBash: What if the school district feels that they can\u2019t safely go into the school because there is a flare-up in that district. Remote learning, are you okay with it in that situation?\nDeVos: If there is a short-term flare-up for a few days, that\u2019s a different situation than planning for an entire school year in anticipation of something that hasn\u2019t happened. That\u2019s a very different thing, kids have gotta be back in school \u2026\nAs indicated by the bolded section, DeVos did not directly say that schools couldn\u2019t plan for a potential COVID-19 outbreak, but rather that planning for a long-term, school-year shutdown was \u201cdifferent\u201d than preparing for handling a brief flare-up of COVID-19 that might occur after schools had re-opened. We should note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that if a school found at least one confirmed COVID-19 case in the building, it should assess the risk, and regardless of the extent of community spread, shut down for potentially 2-5 days to clean and contact trace. In the case of substantial community spread, the CDC has recommended \u201cextended school dismissals.\u201d\nLike many of DeVos\u2019 responses, this one did not offer a firm answer about what a school district could or should do in that situation. Rather, her language repeatedly sidestepped Bash\u2019s questioning in favor of returning to her main talking point about the necessity of reopening schools.\u00a0\nIn summary, the meme circulating on Facebook suggested a clear statement on DeVos\u2019 part that schools could not actually prepare for a COVID-19 outbreak that \u201chasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d DeVos did not expressly say or suggest that, so we thus rate this claim \u201cMostly False.\u201d", "claim": "In response to a question in a July 2020 CNN interview about what would happen if a COVID-19 outbreak occurred in schools, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said, \u201cYou can\u2019t plan for something that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "In June 2019, news outlets throughout the United States, and beyond, reported on the case of Jessica Stallings, a 32-year-old Alabama woman who claimed she was suffering the consequences of the state\u2019s failure to legally prevent rapists from visiting or having custody over the children of their victims.\u00a0On 12 June, for example, the Monroe, La., television channel KNOE posted an article with the headline \u201cAlabama Court Forces Rape Survivor to Allow Rapist to Have Visitation With Children,\u201d which reported that: \u201cA 32-year-old woman in Birmingham, Alabama says the state\u2019s laws have forced her to face the man she says raped her again and again.\u201dAs part of an 11 June interview with Stallings, who in that instance was identified only by her first name, the Birmingham, Ala., television channel WIAT reported that:\u201c\u2026 [Stallings] was impregnated four times. At 14, she miscarried. At 16, she had a baby boy. At 18, she had her third child. He later died due to a disease common in cases of incest. At 19, Jessica had her youngest son. She says her family threatened her to ensure she stayed home and the nature of her children\u2019s conception remained secret \u2026\u201cHer accused rapist has been taking her to court, and winning, for visitation rights of her sons. The man that raped Jessica currently has visitation rights to her two children. The judge told Jessica for each visit she denied her rapist, she\u2019d have to spend 48 hours in the county jail.\u201dA day earlier, on 10 June, the London  published a report with the headline \u201cRape Survivor Fighting Rapist for Custody of Child in Alabama.\u201d That report was actually a re-publication of a 9 June article by the , in which Stallings allowed her full name to be used. The  reported that:\u201c\u2026[Stallings] said she was 12 when her mother\u2019s half brother began climbing into her bed at night. Before she turned 18,she had endured four pregnancies. The first ended in miscarriage, and one son died of a disease more likely to occur in cases of incest. Then her family forced her to marry her uncle, she said. Stallings later fled, and a court deemed the marriage illegal because of a \u2018familial relationship.\u2019\u201cShe built a stable home in Fort Payne, Ala., for her sons, now 15 and 12. Butin the winter of 2017, she discovered that she was not yet free of the man she calls \u2018Uncle Lenny.\u2019 Despite DNA tests that proved incest, he maintained parental rights to the boys andfought Stallings for visitation. A judge ruled he was entitled to see them for three days during Christmastime.\u201cHer uncle \u2014 Lenion Richard Barnett Jr., 39 \u2014 could not be reached for comment, and his attorneys declined to speak about his case with Stallings. \u2018It\u2019s sickening,\u2019 Stallings said. \u2018I\u2019ve spent my entire life scared to death of my rapist, and now, I\u2019m fighting him for custody of my children.'\u201dThese accounts of Stallings\u2019 plight prompted widespread reaction on social media, as well as multiple inquiries from Snopes readers about the full facts surrounding the case.\u00a0The news articles that surrounded Stallings\u2019 public statements in June 2019 contained a significant degree of accuracy. Stallings and Barnett were indeed engaged in a child-custody and visitation dispute, as of June 2019, and documentary evidence exists that demonstrates one of the children in question was born as a result of a statutory rape perpetrated against Stallings.\u00a0However, in several instances those news reports failed to provide readers with important contextual information, or to fully reflect the nuance and complexity involved in what is a difficult, long-running legal saga involving very serious allegations of rape, assault, family breakdown, mental illness and drug abuse.\u00a0(The following explication of the facts was taken from multiple Alabama court records, which Snopes obtained. Where there is a dispute or uncertainty over a claim or allegation, we note that. Snopes usually does not name survivors of rape and sexual assault, but we are naming Stallings in this article because she herself has decided to speak publicly).The visitation and custody dispute between Stallings and Barnett relates to two boys, aged 12 and 15 as of June 2019. Stallings gave birth to the younger boy in August 2006 and the older boy in July 2003. Stallings herself was born in April 1987, meaning she was 16 years old at the time her older son was born. Stallings turned 16 less than three months before giving birth to the boy, so by biological necessity she was 15 years old at the time of his conception. In Alabama, the age of consent is 16, as it was in 2002. These facts demonstrate that Stallings was, on at least one occasion, the subject of a statutory rape.\u00a0She has alleged that Barnett raped her repeatedly throughout her teenage years. We asked Barnett\u2019s attorney whether he denied these allegations, but we did not receive a response in time for publication.\u00a0According to a later court filing by Stallings, Barnett was not listed as the father of either boy on their birth certificates. (We asked Stallings\u2019 current attorney if we could view a copy of the birth certificates, but the attorney declined).\u00a0In January 2008, Stallings and Barnett were married at the Jackson County Courthouse in Scottsboro, Ala. At the time, Stallings was 20 and Barnett was 27. By August, Stallings sued for divorce. In a court filing, her attorney at the time wrote that Stallings and Barnett had \u201cbecome incompatible in their tastes, natures, views, likes and dislikes and their outlooks have become widely separated and divergent\u201d to the extent that \u201cit is impossible for them to live together as husband and wife.\u201dIn filing for divorce, Stallings did not state (as she later would) that she was coerced or pressured into marrying Barnett in the first place, nor did she make any allegation of rape against Barnett in any court filing associated with the divorce. (In March 2009, while the divorce was being processed, DeKalb County District Court records show that Stallings did apply for and obtain a restraining order against Barnett, claiming that he had sent her threatening text messages, had threatened to physically attack her and her boyfriend, had physically assaulted her in the past, and had threatened to kill her if she did not sign over custody of the children).\u00a0Their divorce was finalized in November 2009. Under the terms of the divorce settlement, to which both Stallings and Barnett agreed, the two boys were described as \u201cborn to the parties\u201d \u2014 that is, their children together. Barnett was given primary custody of the boys, while Stallings was given visitation rights on every second weekend, for a week around Christmas, a week during Spring Break and a week during June. Stallings and Barnett also divided up their custody of the boys on holidays such as Thanksgiving and on various birthdays.\u00a0None of the June 2019 news articles about this case mentioned the fact that when Stallings and Barnett were divorced in 2009, Barnett \u2014 rather than Stallings \u2014 was given primary custody of the boys. Neither did the articles mention that, in filing for divorce, Stallings provided several grounds, but she never cited Barnett\u2019s alleged repeated rape as one of them. These facts certainly do not mean Stallings\u2019 2019 allegations are not true, but they are relevant pieces of background information that would have provided readers with additional context and better reflected the complicated, long-running nature of Stallings\u2019 and Barnett\u2019s court battles.\u00a0According to court records, Barnett was arrested and indicted on several criminal charges between 2010 and 2012, in both Alabama and Tennessee, including theft, assault and reckless endangerment. In one August 2010 incident, the Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Barnett had attacked a corrections officer and attempted to take the officer\u2019s weapon, while he was being transported to a mental-health hospital in Tennessee, before he fled into nearby woods. In 2014, Barnett was found not guilty \u201cby reason of mental disease and defect\u201d of two car thefts in Alabama, after he was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia. His attorney in the theft case said Barnett had told her he had been hospitalized at three other psychiatric facilities in Alabama.\u00a0Barnett\u2019s criminal activities and mental-health difficulties brought about a major development in the decade-long legal dispute between Stallings and Barnett, when Stallings petitioned the juvenile court in DeKalb County, seeking to change the custody arrangement in place between the two. The juvenile court records are sealed, but we have a reliable overview of what transpired after 2012, based on a summary published by the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals in April 2018:\u201cIn April 2012, [Stallings] filed in the DeKalb Juvenile Court (\u2018the juvenile court\u2019) an emergency motion for custody of the children; she also filed two form complaints, which initiated a separate action for each child, seeking to have the children declared dependent and in which she alleged that [Barnett] had been arrested in Tennessee, had recently been committed to and released from a mental-health-care facility, had a history of mental-health issues and drug use, and, at a recent visitation, had \u2018attempted to fight\u2019 the mother.\u201dSo based on Barnett\u2019s arrests, incarceration, and hospitalization, Stallings sought in 2012 to have the juvenile court declare the children dependent \u2014 a step commonly taken by juvenile courts when a legal guardian or parent, for various potential reasons, can no longer take care of a child \u2014 and also asked the court to give her custody of the children. She succeeded in taking over primary custody of the two boys, with Barnett retaining certain visitation rights, essentially reversing the arrangement that had been in place since the 2009 divorce settlement.The boys appear to have lived primarily with their mother since 2012, but further legal wrangling began in 2015, when Barnett petitioned the juvenile court to vacate the custody arrangement it had ordered three years earlier. This particular dispute was rather technical in nature, centering on whether the juvenile court had properly disposed of the request for a dependency declaration, before resolving the custody dispute. Both parties argued their cases before the juvenile court until 2017, when the matter was elevated to the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals. In April 2018, that court sided with Barnett\u2019s argument and voided the juvenile court\u2019s 2012 order.In 2017, two separate but parallel proceedings began. On the one hand, Stallings reported to the DeKalb County Sheriff\u2019s Office an allegation that Barnett had repeatedly raped her. The Sheriff\u2019s Office and the office of Alabama\u2019s Ninth Judicial Circuit Court (which covers DeKalb County) launched an investigation into those allegations.Bob Johnston, chief deputy district attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit, told Snopes that, \u201cThere was no new information that would justify an additional presentation to the grand jury.\u201d Stallings had made similar allegations of rape and incest against Barnett in 2015, allegations that she told the  she had made \u201csoon after the custody fight began.\u201d Those claims led to an earlier formal investigation and the empanelment of a grand jury. That grand jury decided not to indict Barnett in December 2015.On the other hand, Stallings took significant new steps, in civil court, to counteract Barnett\u2019s efforts to change the custody arrangement in place since 2012, when DeKalb County Juvenile Court gave Stallings primary custody of the two boys.\u00a0In January 2018, she petitioned the DeKalb County Circuit Court to annul her marriage to Barnett (declare it \u201cvoid ab initio,\u201d or invalid from the outset), and thereby to also void the 2009 divorce decree. Stallings argued that the 2008 marriage had been incestuous, because Barnett is her mother\u2019s half-brother and therefore her own uncle \u201cby half-blood,\u201d which falls under Alabama\u2019s legal definition of incest.\u00a0The DeKalb County Circuit Court agreed to temporarily pause enforcement of the divorce decree, but as of June 2019 it had not given a final or permanent judgement on the validity of the marriage (and therefore the divorce settlement). This was in contrast to claims in various news reports that the court had \u201cdeemed the marriage illegal.\u201dWhen the Court of Civil Appeals gave its ruling in April 2018, Stallings escalated her efforts to obtain custody of the boys. Because the appeals court vacated the juvenile court\u2019s 2012 ruling (which gave Stallings primary custody), the only legitimate custody order in place would be the one contained in the 2009 divorce settlement, which gave Barnett primary custody. So while the court was considering Stallings\u2019 motion to declare the marriage (and divorce settlement) void, she filed another motion in April 2018, this time asking the court for  custody \u2014 that is, for her to be given  custody of the children while the court decided on her underlying request to declare the marriage and divorce decree void.\u00a0At the end of May 2018, Circuit Judge Shaunathan Bell ordered that, until a further hearing in September, the children would remain placed with Stallings, with Barnett allowed four hours of supervised visitation per week, at a Fort Payne facility operated by the DeKalb County Children\u2019s Advocacy Center.\u00a0In November 2018, Stallings and Barnett (through their respective attorneys) appeared to have come to a new unwritten arrangement in which Stallings retained primary custody of the boys, but Barnett was allowed a measure of unsupervised visitation rights. (No record of that agreement exists in the case docket, but Bell referenced it in a June 2019 ruling).\u00a0On 30 May 2019, Barnett was arrested in Fort Payne, Ala., on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia. As a result, Stallings filed a new motion, asking Bell to set aside the unwritten November agreement that allowed Barnett unsupervised visitation of the children, claiming that her 12-year-old son had been in Barnett\u2019s car with him when Barnett was arrested.\u00a0We repeatedly asked Fort Payne Police Department for details of Barnett\u2019s arrest, making several requests for a copy of the incident report. Unfortunately, we did not receive a substantive response in time for publication, meaning we cannot verify the boy\u2019s having been present with Barnett at the time of the arrest.\u00a0On 18 June 2019, Bell ordered Stallings and Barnett to return to the arrangement he had previously set down, meaning the boys would continue to be placed with Stallings for the foreseeable future, but Barnett would again be allowed four hours of supervised visitation per week. Bell scheduled what he called a final hearing on the underlying question of the validity of the 2008 marriage and 2009 divorce settlement, to take place on 12 August.\u00a0The core claim made in multiple news reports in June 2019, and the claim submitted to Snopes\u00a0for verification, was that a judge in Alabama had ordered a rape survivor (in this claim, Jessica Stallings) to allow the man who raped her (in this claim, Lenion Richard Barnett) to have visitation rights over her children.\u00a0There is no doubt that DeKalb County Circuit Judge Shaunathan Bell has ordered that Barnett must temporarily be given limited rights to supervised visits with the two boys at the center of this case. (What the June 2019 news reports failed to mention was that Bell\u2019s order did not come out of the blue, but rather after a decade of intensive and difficult legal wrangling between Stallings and Barnett, beginning with a 2009 divorce settlement that actually gave Barnett primary custody of the boys).It\u2019s also true that Stallings\u2019 eldest son was conceived when she was under the age of consent, meaning that she can be accurately described as a survivor of statutory rape. Furthermore, Barnett has repeatedly claimed visitation rights over that boy, based on a 2009 divorce settlement that described the children as being \u201cborn to\u201d Barnett and Stallings. Clearly, this could lead a reasonable person to conclude that Barnett has, by implication, admitted to perpetrating a statutory rape against Stallings.\u00a0However, . DNA testing could establish Barnett\u2019s biological paternity of Stallings\u2019 eldest son, but it\u2019s not clear whether such DNA test results exist, or what they show, despite widely repeated claims in the June 2019 news coverage that DNA tests had \u201cproven incest.\u201dWe asked Stallings\u2019 attorney to provide any documentation, including DNA test results, which demonstrate that Barnett is the biological father of the two boys in question. The attorney declined to do so. We later asked the same attorney whether she or Stallings had possession of any such DNA test results. Stallings\u2019 attorney told us that DNA testing had formed part of the criminal investigation into her client\u2019s allegations against Barnett, but that she herself was \u201cnot privy\u201d to that investigation.\u00a0We asked the the Ninth Judicial Circuit District Attorney Office whether, as part of the investigations into Barnett, a DNA sample had been taken from him, whether testing had been done to check if he was the biological father of the children in question, and what the results of those tests were. Chief Deputy District Attorney Johnston told us, \u201cIt would be inappropriate for me to comment upon the evidence/lack of evidence \u2026\u201dIn May 2018, Stallings\u2019 attorney argued in a court filing that:\u00a0\u201c\u2026 DNA testing can establish the blood relationship between [Stallings] and [Barnett] as well as whether or not [Barnett] is the biological father of the children. It is the understanding and belief that there has been DNA seized as part of the criminal investigation.\u201dAs of 24 June 2019, no DNA test results demonstrating that Barnett is the biological father of Stallings\u2019 eldest son had been submitted to the court as part of the ongoing custody dispute between the two, and neither Stallings\u2019 attorney nor the District Attorney\u2019s Office could provide Snopes such test results. Until and unless such results become available, we cannot verify the claim that Barnett perpetrated a statutory rape against Stallings, because we cannot verify whether Barnett is the biological father of Stallings\u2019 eldest son.\u00a0This might seem an odd conclusion, given that Barnett himself has repeatedly claimed custody over both boys, based on a 2009 divorce settlement that described the children as being \u201cborn to\u201d Barnett and Stallings. However, the specific claim of statutory rape is contingent upon Barnett\u2019s biological paternity of the eldest boy, and so far we have found no physical evidence of that.\u00a0More broadly, Stallings has claimed that Barnett repeatedly raped her over the course of her teenage years. However, despite two formal investigations of those rape and incest allegations, one of which led to a grand jury being empanelled, Barnett has never been convicted, or even indicted, on charges of rape or incest.\u00a0", "claim": "In 2018 or 2019, an Alabama court ordered a rape survivor named Jessica Stallings to allow her rapist to visit the children who were born to them.

{"evidence": "The online retailing giant Amazon.com came under scrutiny in March 2019 when reports emerged that their product listings had included \u201cchild sex dolls for pedophiles.\u201d On 23 March, the right-leaning website PJ Media reported that:The article included screenshots of the dolls, and its author, Megan Fox, showed what appeared to be an authentic Amazon listing for one of the dolls in a live video she broadcast on 23 March. After her article was published, Fox updated it to reflect the fact that Amazon had removed the listings for the dolls from their website.A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed in a statement sent to Snopes that the dolls had indeed been listed but had since been removed, writing: \u201cAll Marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don\u2019t will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The products in question are no longer available.\u201dAccording to Fox\u2019s account, provided in her live 23 March video, the items were removed from the website \u201cwithin three minutes\u201d of her article\u2019s publication, which suggested that Amazon acted relatively promptly after they became aware of the products.We asked the company for a precise explanation of why the items highlighted by PJ Media had been removed, and whether those product listings constituted a violation of Amazon\u2019s rules, but we did not receive a response to those particular questions.According to Amazon\u2019s policies and rules, the company prohibits the sale of the following kinds of items (among others):The company warns of the following possible consequences for a seller who attempts to list one of the aforementioned product types and notes that the decision as to whether a product violates Amazon\u2019s rules is largely at the discretion of the company:\u201cViolations of Amazon\u2019s listing policies may result in actions such as:Amazon reserves the right to make judgments in its sole discretion about whether or not a listing is appropriate.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear what the specific basis was for Amazon\u2019s decision to remove the two dolls discovered by PJ Media. As of 28 March, the seller who had listed the dolls was still active as an Amazon vendor. We asked the company why the seller in question had not been suspended or had their selling privileges revoked, but we did not receive a response to that particular question.As of 28 March, it was not illegal in the United States to buy or sell sex dolls that resemble children. However, on 27 March the Florida State Senate scheduled the third reading of a bill (SB 160) which would prohibit \u201cknowingly selling, lending, giving away, distributing, transmitting, showing, or transmuting; offering to commit such actions; having in his or her possession, custody, or control with the intent to commit such actions; or advertising in any manner an obscene, child-like sex doll.\u201dIn 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 4655, known as the CREEPER Act, which would have banned the importation or transportation of \u201cchild sex dolls,\u201d which the bill defined as \u201can anatomically-correct doll, mannequin, or robot, with the features of, or with features that resemble those of, a minor, intended for use in sexual acts.\u201d The bill was sent to the U.S. Senate and referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 2018, but it did not advance from there.The bill argued that child sex dolls should be banned on the grounds that a correlation exists between the use and possession of such dolls and the consumption and production of child sex abuse imagery, that would-be predators could use such dolls to learn how to rape children, and that the dolls are \u201cintrinsically related to abuse of minors, and they cause the exploitation, objectification, abuse, and rape of minors.\u201dHowever, critics of such legislation have argued that the dolls are not \u201cobscene material\u201d in and of themselves, and that therefore a ban on them would be an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment right to free speech.

But \u2014since the country\u2019s post-World War II constitution bars officials from enforcing Wuhan-style shutdowns in the name of protecting residents\u2019 civil liberties \u2014 government leaders cannot punish citizens if they don\u2019t follow the recommendations on social distancing.\nThe day following the viral tweet, McAfee again authored claims that were similar in nature \u2014 posts that compared New York City\u2019s pace of death to the average rate of large cities worldwide including Delhi and Mexico City \u2014 aiming to raise suspicion among his followers of the U.S. governments\u2019 rationale for, as he put it, \u201cshutting down and destroying the economies of the world.\u201d Even Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk chimed in on the campaign, tweeting:\n\nMcAfee made several claims in his tweets, but we are focusing on whether New York\u2019s death rate was truly 250 times \u201chigher\u201d than Tokyo\u2019s as of April 25, 2020, and whether\u00a0that pace increased over the following week.\nIt\u2019s important to note at the start that this is a thorny comparison for a couple reasons: The cities\u2019 populations vary depending on what geographic areas you consider, the regions\u2019 processes for COVID-19 testing are different, and it\u2019s unknown to what extent those testing practices influence government-compiled death tolls.\nOn May 1, Snopes reached out to McAfee to ask how he reached the calculation in the above-displayed tweet, and he answered with a phone call, emails, and direct messages on Twitter. One correspondence read:\n\nTo calculate the rate at which the novel coronavirus is killing in New York City, McAfee said he considered the metro\u2019s population to be 8 million. (2018 census data show 8,398,748 New York residents.) But for Tokyo\u2019s population, he said he used a population size of 23 million \u2014 a number that apparently includes not only people living within the city\u2019s official boundaries (about 9.2 million) but also residents in surrounding jurisdictions.\nThat\u2019s a step where the calculating gets murky. Like McAfee, the United Nations also measures Tokyo\u2019s population as the sum of the entire metro area. But the U.N. documented more than 37 million residents as of 2018, not 23 million.\nFrom that point, McAfee said he divided his estimates for the cities\u2019 populations by their total of COVID-19 deaths, respectively, and then compared the two death rates.\nWhile repeating that step for Snopes on May 1, he used about 13,000 for the number of deaths in New York City and about 97 deaths in Tokyo, totaling one COVID-19 death per 615 people in New York City and one death per roughly 237,000 people in Tokyo. Using that math by McAfee, as of May 1, New York City\u2019s rate of death was about 385 times higher than Tokyo.\nBut to check his work, we first analyzed the New York City Health Department (NYC Health) criteria for counting fatalities. In March, when the department tallied the city\u2019s first handful of deaths, it only considered fatalities of people who had tested positive for COVID-19 via a laboratory-sponsored test. That meant that, initially, patients who died at home and didn\u2019t seek medical treatment were not included in the statistics. But in mid-April, the health department changed its system and also began tracking fatalities of people who had showed symptoms of COVID-19 but were never tested for it.\u00a0\nAs of April 25, the day of McAfee\u2019s viral tweet, NYC Health reported 17,393 deaths total, including both types of fatalities: people who had officially tested positive and those who medical examiners had determined \u201cCOVID-19\u201d or the equivalent as their cause of death. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government documented less than 120 deaths.\nUsing those numbers and population estimates via the U.S. census and United Nations, NYC\u2019s rate of COVID-19 deaths was almost 640 times greater than Tokyo\u2019s as of April 25.\nBut, for several reasons, people should not take the government-compiled death tolls at face value. For one, the pace at which all local jurisdictions, whether in the U.S. or not, report deaths varies. Medical examiners can take days or weeks to process death certificates and compile that information for public records. Referring to the worldwide COVID-19 casualty count, Tim Riffe, a demographer at Germany\u2019s Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, told The New York Times:\nWhatever number is reported on a given day is going to be a gross underestimate. [\u2026] In a lot of places the pandemic has been going on for long enough that there has been sufficient time for late death registrations to come in, giving us a more accurate picture of what the mortality really was.\nAdditionally, cities and countries have different criteria for administering COVID-19 tests, and residents in some locations have greater access to the testing compared to others. In Japan, officials have decided against widespread testing for COVID-19, \u201cinstead focusing on targeting clusters of infection when they appear in an effort to snuff out any further spread,\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported.\nAs of May 5, Tokyo had tested roughly 12,500 people for COVID-19 and about 4,700 of them were positive, according to the city\u2019s government, which is publishing its updates via an interactive web page. (For perspective, about 901,000 New York residents had been tested within roughly the same window.) In addition to excluding potential patients who are returning to the country via cruises or charter flights, the Tokyo statistics do not include people who showed mild-to-moderate symptoms \u2014 a shortness of breath, coughing or fever \u2014 and might have tested positive for COVID-19 if they had a test.\nProfessor Kenji Shibuya, who leads King\u2019s College London\u2019s Institution of Population Health, told BBC that from a physician\u2019s viewpoint, Japan\u2019s approach to testing makes sense: \u201cForget about mild cases, focus on cases with major symptoms and save lives. Focus testing on those who have symptoms.\u201d\nBut it also means the total number of infections in the country, including in Tokyo, are likely far greater than what public health officials are reporting and do not lend themselves to an apples-to-apples comparison with other cities, such as New York City.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are definitely missing a lot of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases,\u201d Shibuya told BBC of the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. \u201cThere is clearly widespread community transmission. I am very worried by this situation.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s undetermined is to what extent the differences in testing for COVID-19 between Tokyo and New York impact their death tolls. In other words, it\u2019s unclear how many people in each city have been fatally infected with the novel coronavirus yet do not appear in government-certified mortality statistics, whether because they didn\u2019t seek medical help or didn\u2019t receive a COVID-19 test.\nIn the interview with Snopes, McAfee agreed: No one quite knows the exact number of infections in both places, and so accurately calculating the rate of disease is impossible. But he argued that tabulating the rate of COVID-19 deaths is a different story, since he believes government officials, especially in Japan, are tracking and publicly releasing every COVID-19 death. He said:\nIn Japan, if you know anything of that country, there is not a death anywhere from anything remotely resembling a lower respiratory tract infection, which is not tested (for COVID-19) \u2026 which is why I picked Tokyo\u2026 There\u2019s not a doctor in this world who would question the Japanese medical death number, good heavens. You know how many people investigate every death and disease in Japan? So that [issue of COVID-19 patients dying in Tokyo without being included in the public death toll numbers] cannot happen.\nNow, if it\u2019s happening in New York, that just makes it even worse \u2014 then [the rate of death] is thousands times greater than Tokyo\u2019s. You can\u2019t reason out of this \u2026 numbers don\u2019t lie.\nWhether or not it \u201ccannot happen\u201d (as McAfee claims) that COVID-19 patients in Tokyo have died without being included in the public death toll, the disparity between the death rate per population in Tokyo versus New York is large enough that it\u2019s unlikely any corrections to the basic data could negate it entirely. The nagging question is why the disparity exists and what it really tells us. McAfee leaps to the suggestion that there is \u201csomething fishy here,\u201d implying nefarious reasons for the disparity, but a serious analysis would require more and better data, and consideration within the wider context of drastically varying COVID-19 mortality rates across all major regions.\u00a0", "claim": "As of April 25, 2020, the rate of people dying from the COVID-19 coronavirus disease in New York City was at least 250 times \"higher\" than Tokyo's \u2014 and growing with time.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}

{"evidence": "South African comedian Trevor Noah often talks about growing up under apartheid as the child of a black mother and white father. So if it seems a stretch that the famously mixed-race host of Comedy Central\u2019s long-running parody news program \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d would call on non-whites to unite in anger against white people in South Africa, it\u2019s because he didn\u2019t.\nThe fake quote attributed to Noah has been circulating on the internet, in varying forms and countries, since at least 2017, according to an investigation by Digital Forensic Research Lab, a project of the international affairs think tank Atlantic Council, which traces the sources of online disinformation.\nIn a nutshell, the quote calls on immigrants and black South Africans to unite in their anger toward white South Africans, who control most of the country\u2019s wealth. \u201cWhites in South Africa makes up about 8.7% of the population and controls over 85% wealth,\u201d the quote states, then continues, \u201cI say that your anger and outrage is misplaced. African immigrants don\u2019t own lands, don\u2019t run companies, don\u2019t operate trophy hunting companies, do not ship out capital to European banks.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a toxic quote, considering that its spread online coincides with deadly xenophobic violence in South Africa. And even though it isn\u2019t authentic, it spread on various African websites and on social media.\nThe sharing of the quote to U.S. readers got a boost from frequent purveyors of online disinformation, including Alex Jones\u2019 conspiracy site Infowars, as well as Jim Hoft, who runs the junk news site Gateway Pundit, and Jack Posobiec, a right-wing internet personality who helped spread the Pizzagate conspiracy theory.\n\nThe quote has changed over time. According to the Digital Forensic Research Lab, the earliest version of it has been on the internet since Feb. 20, 2017, when a Nigerian website published it and attributed it to Noah without any citations. It was then reproduced by a Malawian website with the claim that Noah gave the markedly unfunny monologue while hosting his comedy show.\nThe quote hadn\u2019t seen much activity since early 2017 but then reemerged with the start of violence targeting immigrants in South Africa in early September 2019.\nIn 2017, Noah made a comment about race but it was the inverse of the fake one attributed to him. Noah told Canadian broadcaster CBC that apartheid represents one of the easiest forms of control, accomplished by \u201c[convincing people] that they are different \u2014 even black people by the way \u2014 and [separating] them into groups that now spend more time trying to fight each other than realizing that they all share a common goal.\u201d\nNoah also authored a book entitled \u201cBorn a Crime\u201d about his experience growing up under apartheid as a mixed-race child, as his parents\u2019 union at the time was a violation of South African law under apartheid.\nFor reference, the version of the quote circulating in the U.S. as of this writing states in full:\nThere are about 2.3 million immigrants living in South Africa, this number includes other Africans, Chinese, Bangladeshi, Indians, middle easterners and Europeans who are not born in SA. out of this number, only 1.6 million are Africans. The 1.6 MILLION Africans mostly run small shops, vending, service industries, etc. They may lay claim to less than 0.00001% of wealth in SA.\nWhites in South Africa makes up about 8.7% of the population and controls over 85% wealth. Though there are increases in black CEOs and managers, these are mere servants and just a optical presentations. There are about 6000 European families who own over 85% of agricultural lands in south Africa. So when I hear south Africans claiming that other Africans are competing with them on dwindling/scarce resources, I say that your anger and outrage is misplaced. African immigrants don\u2019t own lands, don\u2019t run companies, don\u2019t operate trophy hunting companies, do not ship out capital to European banks.\nYours is a misplaced anger, prejudice and xenophobia built up out of inferiority complex created by decades of apartheid and oppression. I don\u2019t see fellow African as a competitor but a fellow compatriot who is struggling to feed his family and have some comfort in this short life-time. If you feel undeserved in wealth distribution, please research again who controls that wealth and it has nothing to do with some Nigerian, Zimbabwean or Mozambican working in a restaurant or Ethiopian running a small shop, or a Ghanaian mechanic working hard in the sun.

{"evidence": "In January 2020, readers asked us about the accuracy of reports that claimed officials in a county in Michigan had threatened to demolish more than a dozen homes in a local Amish community unless their owners upgraded them in a way that is antithetical to their religious beliefs.\u00a0\nOn Dec. 20, 2019, The Daily Sheeple published an article with the headline \u201cMichigan County Threatens to Demolish 14 Amish Homes Unless They Give Up Their Religious Beliefs and Upgrade Their Homes.\u201d The article reported that:\nAfter harassing the Amish community for years regarding its water supply and disposal, the county health department posted signs on the Amish families\u2019 homes earlier this year condemning them as \u201cunfit for human habitation\u201d and filed lawsuits against 14 Amish families in November. If successful, the lawsuits would result in the demolition of the Amish families\u2019 homes and would effectively banish an entire religious community from Lenawee County. The ACLU and Wright & Schulte filed answers to those lawsuits Wednesday in Lenawee County Circuit Court, which include counterclaims against the county for religious discrimination in violation of the federal and state constitutions and the federal Fair Housing Act.\nThe following day, the right-leaning website DC Dirty Laundry re-published the same article.\u00a0\nSetting aside a measure of editorialization, the factual claims contained in the article were highly accurate, which is perhaps not surprising because they were entirely plagiarized from a Dec. 18 press release published by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is representing the Amish families in question.\u00a0\nIn November, the Lenawee County Health Department filed a lawsuit in Lenawee Circuit Court, asking the judge to enforce what the department had determined were numerous breaches of several county health code regulations around sewage disposal and running water at 14 Amish-owned homes in Morenci, Michigan.\u00a0\nAccording to the complaint filed by the county, health officials began their investigations into the homes after a complaint was filed in June 2015. Upon visiting the homes, health inspectors found what they determined to be an unsafe absence of a proper sewage-disposal system and running water, constituting violations of county health code regulations.\nOn that basis, the county began a near four-year process of attempting to enforce the requirements of the health code and getting the homes upgraded to be in compliance, a process the complaint described as futile, because the Amish families in question refused to make the requested installations.\u00a0\nThe stand-off came to a head in July 2019, when the county health department issued an order for the families to vacate the properties. The county concluded that the buildings are \u201cunfit for habitation\u201d and in violation of multiple health code regulations; that neighboring properties were being harmed by the improper disposal of sewage on the surface of the ground; and that \u201cinjury to persons, particularly children, is highly probable.\u201d\u00a0\nOn that basis, the complaint asked the circuit court to issue an injunction preventing the Amish families from building any further properties that are not compliant with health regulations, and giving them 30 days in which to bring their homes into compliance with the health code, or to demolish them. The county has further requested that if the families do neither, the county should be authorized to demolish the homes, and that the families should bear the costs associated with the demolition.\u00a0\nIn this respect, the ACLU press release\u00a0 \u2014 and by extension the posts published by The Daily Sheeple and DC Dirty Laundry \u2014 accurately stated that Lenawee County had threatened to demolish the Amish families\u2019 homes.\u00a0\nFor their part, the families\u2019 have submitted to the court that the county\u2019s enforcement of the health code regulations constitutes a violation of their First Amendment right to live in accordance with the requirements of their religious faith. In a series of counter-claims filed on Dec. 18, 2019, the families outlined the religious reasons for their non-compliance with the county\u2019s orders:\nAmish religious observances include simple living and rejection of modern technology. Because of their religious beliefs, Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange obtain all of the water used in their home from a manually operated well on their property. Consistent with these beliefs and methods, they use a minimal amount of water in their homes, far less than is common among most modern homeowners. Consistent with these beliefs, Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange also do not utilize modern indoor plumbing; instead Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange use what is commonly referred to as an outhouse, or outdoor privy, for elimination of human waste/black water.\nThe method by which Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange provide water to their home and dispose of their black water and grey water is sufficient for their and their family\u2019s needs and does not present a health or safety threat to them, their family, their neighbors, or the public at large. Lenawee County health officials have been made aware by Defendants, and other members of the Amish community, of their religious views.\nUpon information and belief, Plaintiff seeks to impose certain black water disposal, grey water disposal, plumbing, and water supply requirements at the Premises that would require Defendants to include system design, mechanical equipment, or other devices, construction techniques, or implementation methods that would violate Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange\u2019s religious beliefs and practices. Upon information and belief, Plaintiff seeks to impose certain black water disposal, grey water disposal, plumbing, and water supply requirements at the Premises that would require Defendants to include system design, mechanical equipment, or other devices, construction techniques, or implementation methods that are wholly unnecessary, especially when properly viewed in conjunction with their religious beliefs and practices.\nAmong other things, removal of human excreta from their outdoor privy through mechanical means such as pumping would violate Mr. and Mrs. Delagrange\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs and practices; instead, their religion dictates that they remove the human excreta through their own toil.\nIn constitutional jurisprudence, First Amendment rights are not regarded as being absolute. The right to free speech, political association, assembly, protest, and to exercise one\u2019s religious faith do not, in all cases, outweigh any other consideration. However, the courts have established that the state must have a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in curtailing such freedoms, in order for such a restriction to be constitutionally acceptable.\u00a0\nIn the Lenawee case, the ACLU has argued on behalf of the families that, because (they contend) there is no risk or a low risk of harm from the existing sewage-disposal methods used by the families, the state does not have a compelling interest in forcing the families to contravene their own religious beliefs by upgrading their sewage systems.\u00a0", "claim": "In 2019, Lenawee County threatened to demolish the homes of several Amish families unless the families brought them into compliance with health codes.

Sharing the video with her roughly 2.6 million followers, for example, conservative provocateur Candace Owens wrote on Twitter:\n\u201cWhy else does this [shooting of deputies] happen? \u2026 BLACK LIVES MATTER AND THE COMPLICIT MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS, ATHLETES, AND ENTERTAINERS ARE TO BLAME.\u201d\nBelow, we unpack that claim \u2014 which is ultimately a product of an expansive fear-mongering campaign by deceptive media sources to paint the BLM movement as a social force that doesn\u2019t match reality.\u00a0\nAdditionally, hours after the Compton shooting, another layer to the controversy emerged: Reports on social media alleged BLM protesters taunted law enforcement officers standing guard outside the hospital where the deputies were receiving medical treatment, and blocked emergency access to the facility:\n\nThe Epoch Times, a media outlet laden with misinformation that has effectively served to help U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s political agenda since 2016, claimed:\n\u201cBlack Lives Matter protesters blocked a hospital entrance in Los Angeles on Saturday night and yelled, \u2018we hope they die,\u2019 hours after a man shot two county deputies in an ambush.\u201d\nBased on our analysis of videos of the shooting and protests, as well as first-person accounts and news reports, these assertions were a blend of fact and distortions of reality \u2014 presented in memes such as the one displayed below that aimed to dissuade people against supporting the NFL because of its alleged support for protesters who gathered outside the hospital:\n\nWhile some football players were indeed supporters or leaders of the BLM movement, no evidence linked them or the league with the events in Los Angeles. Any social media post that claimed \u201cthe NFL will honor and praise the organization that stood out outside [the] hospital chanting\u201d was at best a misleading attempting to connect dots that didn\u2019t exist. At worst, it was a purposeful attempt to discredit an initiative by the NFL to recognize systemic racism by erroneously linking it to the gathering outside the California medical facility.\nThis information is undeniably true: Two deputies, a 31-year-old female and 24-year-old male, were shot at close range while sitting in a patrol car near the Compton sheriff\u2019s station south of downtown Los Angeles on Sept. 12 around 7 p.m.\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters the female deputy was a mother of a 6-year-old boy \u2014 like the meme about the NFL suggested \u2014 and that both deputies graduated law enforcement training in the same class, just 14 months prior to the shooting.\nThe department released the above-mentioned footage that went viral and apparently depicted the incident. The video showed a gunman wearing dark clothing casually approaching the passenger side of the squad car, raising his gun inches from the window, firing several rounds and then running away.\n\u201cThe gunman walked up on the deputies and opened fire without warning or provocation,\u201d the department tweeted.\nUpdate: The gunman walked up on the deputies and opened fire without warning or provocation. pic.twitter.com/cBQjyKkoxJ\n\u2014 LA County Sheriffs (@LASDHQ) September 13, 2020\n\nAn extended version of the surveillance video obtained by The Los Angeles Times showed the shooter fleeing in the direction from which he came and running past someone nearby on a sidewalk, although it was unclear if, or to what extent, that person was involved in the surprise attack.\nMeanwhile, an Instagram video by an apparent witness to the shooting showed the squad car from the front, several people walking on a nearby sidewalk with their phones out, and emergency vehicles arriving to help the wounded deputies. The narrator in that video said:\nTwo sheriffs shot in the face, they tripping. It\u2019s going up in Compton. [Expletive] just bust on the police. [\u2026] Somebody ran up on the car and busted on their ass, right through the window, in their face and all.\nMany who shared the footage assumed the narrator was an \u201cactivist\u201d and took him to be wrongfully celebrating the shooting. \u201cThese \u2018activists\u2019 are celebrating the attempted executions of two police officers in Compton,\u201d one person tweeted:\nThese \u201cactivists\u201d are celebrating the attempted executions of two police officers in Compton.  pic.twitter.com/zNvTbU4AIa\n\u2014 Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) September 14, 2020\n\nThe Instagram account on which that video originated was deleted after conservatives circulated it widely \u2014 leveraging it for their political message \u2014 so we have no evidence to verify its legitimacy. We also have no evidence to confirm or disprove the claim that the narrator is an \u201cactivist\u201d or in any way associated with the BLM movement.\u00a0\nMoments after the gunfire, medics took the deputies \u2014 whom the department had not identified as of this writing \u2014 to the St. Francis Medical Center, where they underwent surgery. The following day, the hospital listed them in stable condition, and they were expected to recover from multiple gunshot wounds.\nBoth Trump and the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden were quick to condemn the shooting of law enforcement, though their messages varied. Biden said:\nThis cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.\nViolence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished.\nJill and I are keeping the deputies and their loved ones in our hearts and praying for a full recovery. https://t.co/330QfeIUGg\n\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 13, 2020\n\nTrump, meanwhile, retweeted the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s video of the shooting, with the comment: \u201cAnimals that must be hit hard!\u201d Later, he added:\nIf they die, fast trial death penalty for the killer. Only way to stop this! https://t.co/K3sKh28GjX\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2020\n\nCritical to the rumors aiming to spear the BLM movement was this: The intentions of the gunman were unknown, as of this report. No one had come forward to explain the shooter\u2019s motivations behind the attack, nor his whereabouts.\nOn Sept. 14, the sheriff\u2019s department announced a $175,000 reward for information to answer such questions leading to an arrest. In regards to the deputies\u2019 relationship with the suspect \u2014 whom the department described as a Black man between the ages of 28 and 30 years old \u2014 the sheriff told reporters: \u201cTo my knowledge, they had no knowledge of this individual. No provocation. No conflict. Nothing. It was just cold blooded ambush.\u201d\nIn other words, very few details were known about the suspect, and the shooting appeared to be random, per Villanueva.\nThat meant any assumption about the gunman\u2019s social or political affiliations would breach verified fact, as well as any assertion that those alleged beliefs drove the gunman to open fire on the deputies.\nThat is all to say, no evidence connected the shooting \u2014 or the suspected gunman \u2014 to any organization or cause, including the BLM movement like some viral posts claimed.\nIn fact, leaders within the movement sought to distance themselves from the spontaneous violence. For example, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing several high-profile cases alleging wrongful use of force by police against Black Americans that have sparked BLM protests across the country \u2014 including the family of a man fatally shot by the LA sheriff\u2019s department \u2014\u00a0tweeted:\n\u201cWe WILL hold [the sheriff\u2019s department] accountable for systemic brutality. But violence \u2014 including the shooting of two deputies in LA \u2014 is NOT the answer. I urge anyone with info about this incident should come forward.\u201d\nIn the hours after the shooting, roughly five protesters gathered outside the hospital where the deputies were being treated, and law enforcement officers created a barricade there to supposedly keep the protesters from entering the facility.\nWe uncovered these facts about the scene, primarily based on video evidence:\nA tense situation developing in Lynwood as a handful of protesters on sidewalk shout at deputies outside St. Francis medical center where 2 deputies are recovering from surgery after being shot tonight in Compton pic.twitter.com/wwpcnVFvOI\n\u2014 Josie Huang (@josie_huang) September 13, 2020\n\nDuring the ordeal, the sheriff\u2019s office said on Twitter protesters were \u201cblocking the entrance & exit of the hospital emergency room,\u201d and one witness told a local news station that some protesters tried to get inside the facility, though no visual evidence confirmed that was indeed the case.\nTo the protesters blocking the entrance & exit of the HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM yelling \\\"We hope they die\\\" referring to 2 LA Sheriff's ambushed today in #Compton: DO NOT BLOCK EMERGENCY ENTRIES & EXITS TO THE HOSPITAL. People's lives are at stake when ambulances can't get through.\n\u2014 LA County Sheriffs (@LASDHQ) September 13, 2020\n\nRather, video footage showed a handful of deputies standing in a driveway (apparently an entrance to the hospital\u2019s emergency room), while the small group of protesters paced up and down a sidewalk feet away from them.\nAt one point, deputies detained a journalist with LA\u2019s NPR station, KPCC, who was reporting on the small protest, as well as a male protester who \u201crefused to comply\u201d with deputies\u2019 demands to leave the area.\nThe sheriff\u2019s department said the reporter, Josie Huang, ignored deputies\u2019 repeated commands and did not present \u201cproper\u201d press credentials. But she said and videos of her arrest show she didn\u2019t have time or space to react to deputies orders before they shoved her and forcefully took her into custody. In one video, she can be heard shouting \u201cI\u2019m a reporter\u2026 I\u2019m with KPCC\u201d as officers push her to the ground. They cited her with obstructing justice, though KPCC is urging authorities to drop the charge.\nThank you https://t.co/5ajOiRV1m6 for what is the clearest footage of my arrest by @LASDHQ. \nIt\u2019s how I remember it \u2014 like being tossed around in the ocean and then slammed into rock pic.twitter.com/G3rfCR1NiI\n\u2014 Josie Huang (@josie_huang) September 14, 2020\n\nIn a Facebook video posted Sept. 13, Kevin Wharton Price, a founder of an LA-based Black rights group called the Africa Town Coalition, identified himself as the protester whom deputies arrested \u2014 as well as an organizer of the small gathering outside the hospital.\nHe said he and three other people went to the facility to call attention to an alleged gang of deputies within the sheriff\u2019s department that control aspects of the agency, as well as the series of senseless killings of Black people by authorities over the years. And while BLM and Africa Town Coalition share some similar goals, such as empowering Black Americans, he said they have separate ideologies, and the latter group should not be conflated with the former. Price said:\n\u201cAfrica Town came with four people that night. Four people. That was it. \u2026We are not Black Lives Matter. [\u2026] We have our own political agenda.\u201d\nIn addition, he said the rumor that protesters were trying to break into the hospital was false. He said:\nIn the news and some white supremacists are saying that there were Black Lives Matter protesters out there, trying to block the driveway of the hospital, the emergency hospital area, and allegedly trying to force their way in to the emergency room. [\u2026] We did not go to force our way in to anywhere. We went out there to deliver a message to these gang-banging sheriff\u2019s department that we\u2019re not going to shed a tear because two of your gang-banging sheriffs got shot in the head.\n\nIn sum, a group that is not BLM organized the small protest outside the hospital where two deputies received treatment for gunshot wounds, and tried to provoke law enforcement officers standing guard there. No visual evidence confirmed those protesters blocked an emergency access to the facility, though the sheriff\u2019s department reported that was the case. Also, no evidence linked the suspect in the supposed ambush of deputies to the BLM movement, as of this writing. For those reasons, we rate this claim as \u201cMostly false.\u201d", "claim": "A gunman associated with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement shot and wounded two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on Sept. 12, 2020, and BLM protesters afterwards blocked emergency access to the hospital where the deputies received medical treatment.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "In June 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump, accompanied by his wife Melania, paid a state visit to the UK, during which the First Couple was greeted by Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace.During that visit, the  website published an article reporting that the gaffe-prone Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, had mistakenly referred to First Lady Melania Trump as \u201cStormy,\u201d the stage name of a porn actress/stripper who has alleged she was paid $130,000 by Donald Trump for signing a nondisclosure agreement about an affair she had with him in 2006:The article prompted inquiries from Snopes.com readers about its veracity, but the information it contained was not factual. Although the slogan of the Suffolk Gazette is \u201cYou Couldn\u2019t Make It Up,\u201d the website does indeed feature a good deal of made-up material, including royal spoofs holding that Queen Elizabeth sent her husband (Prince Philip) to the airport to pick up the Trumps in his Range Rover, and that the Duchess of Sussex, U.S.-born Meghan Markle, demanded her first child be named Donald after the U.S. President.", "claim": "Prince Philip mistakenly referred to Melania Trump as 'Stormy' during the U.S. First Couple's state visit to the UK.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
{"evidence": "The tribulations of an affable Spix\u2019s macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii) named \u201cBlu\u201d are the focus of the \u201cRio\u201d franchise of movies. Blu in the movie is the last known male of his species, and he must travel to Rio de Janeiro from his captivity in Minnesota to meet the last remaining female of his species to save their kind from extinction.\nBack in the real world, scientists in September 2018 recommended that the Spix\u2019s macaw, also known as the \u201clittle blue macaw,\u201d be reclassified from \u201ccritically endangered\u201d to \u201cextinct in the wild.\u201d\nThis recommendation has not yet been formalized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which maintains a \u201cred list\u201d of endangered species. The organization last assessed the Spix\u2019s macaw on Aug. 7, 2018, prior to the aforementioned study first published online on Sept. 1, 2018. In their paper, the scientists described the last known sightings of Spix\u2019s macaw in the wild:\nLast known from near the rio S\u00e3o Francisco in north Bahia, Brazil, where only three birds remained in 1985\u20131986, and these were captured for trade in 1987 and 1988. However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw (Propyrrhura maracana), was discovered at the site in July 1990, and survived until the end of 2000. There have been no subsequent records of wild birds, despite searches and fieldworker presence in the area. An observation in 2016 in the Curaca area is believed to relate to a release from captivity. Loss of gallery woodland and trapping for the cagebird trade likely drove declines.\nWhile wild individuals have likely not been seen since 2000, a captive population of about 60 or 70 species in the hands of both breeding programs and private owners still exists. In 2018, the Brazilian government announced that a population of around 50 Spix\u2019s macaws from Europe would be transferred to a reintroduction facility in Brazil:\nThe current batch of survivors being repatriated from Europe will initially stay in a special center due to open in Berlin next Thursday, where they will be prepared for the transition. They will then move to a 72-acre reintroduction center in a conservation area of Brazil\u2019s north-eastern state of Bahia, with the first being released into the wild in 2021. Brazil\u2019s environment ministry said that international breeding programs for the birds in captivity have seen the population grow from 79 in 2012 to 158 this year.\nThe number of blue-named and/or blue-colored macaws has created some internet confusion about what birds are \u2014 and are not \u2014endangered or extinct. A viral meme from the French Facebook page Jadore Les Animaux, for example, shared a picture of a blue-colored macaw with the text:\u00a0\u201cThe world is in mourning. The blue macaw has been declared extinct.\u201d\n\nFirst, while there are multiple species of blue macaws, \u201cblue macaw\u201d is not the common or informal name for any of them. The closest match to that name would be the blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna), whose population is not threatened.\nSecondly, as Agence France-Presse noted in a fact check of that viral post, the species shown in the photo was actually a different species of macaw known as the hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus). This species is classified as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the IUCN.\nBut because scientists have determined the wild population of Spix\u2019s macaw to be likely extinct in the wild, we rate the claim about the bird species fictionalized in the \u201cRio\u201d movies as \u201cTrue.\u201d", "claim": "The macaw species from the \u201cRio\u201d movies has been declared extinct in the wild. ", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is True."}
{"evidence": "An image widely circulated on Facebook in response to the National Football League\u2019s anthem controversy held that NFL players did not stand on the sidelines during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games prior to 2009. Instead, they stayed in locker rooms during the anthem and did not begin standing along the sidelines for renditions of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d until after the Defense Department began paying the NFL to hold patriotic displays in 2009:The issue has been in the public spotlight ever since San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began protesting police brutality by kneeling during the playing of the national anthem during exhibition games played prior to the start of the 2016 NFL season. Several other players, including some in other sports, have since taken part in similar silent demonstrations during the 2016 and 2017 seasons.Tom E. Curran of Comcast Sportsnet New England reported in a story published on 29 August 2016 that teams standing together on the field during the playing of the national anthem was a relatively recent development in NFL history: \u201cNFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed this the practice began in 2009, adding, \u2018As you know, the NFL has a long tradition of patriotism. Players are encouraged but not required to stand for the anthem.'\u201dWhat actually changed in 2009, according to NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, was that (due to network timing issues) players had previously remained in their locker rooms during the playing of the national anthem for  games.  After 2009, players appeared in the sidelines for the anthem during primetime games, just as they had been doing all along for Sunday afternoon games.  (The distinction often went unnoticed by viewers, as network telecasts frequently didn\u2019t air the pre-game anthem ceremonies.) ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith referenced Currant\u2019s report during a segment on 14 September 2016, adding a \u201cpaid patriotism\u201d element to the mix:The practice of \u201cpaid patriotism\u201d came to light on 30 April 2015, when Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) released a statement chiding the New Jersey Army National Guard for paying between $97,000 and $115,000 to the New York Jets for a series of promotions involving military personnel. That November, Flake and fellow Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain issued a report stating that the Defense Department had been paying for patriotic displays in football and other sports between 2011 and 2014:However, this report did not cover the year 2009, so it is unclear whether NFL teams\u2019 appearing on the field for the playing of the national anthem truly began in conjunction with the \u201cpaid patriotism\u201d policy. In a September 2017 piece about the anthem controversy, CNN noted that: The league announced in May 2016 that they would refund $723,724 to taxpayers which they said \u201cmay have been mistakenly applied to appreciation activities rather than recruitment efforts\u201d during the years in question.", "claim": "NFL players did not stand for the national anthem until the Defense Dept. started paying the league to stage patriotic displays in 2009.", "response": "According to our knowledge and the given information, we think that the claim is False."}
