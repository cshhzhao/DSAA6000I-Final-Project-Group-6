UPDATE, July 4, 2014: After this article was published, Hillary Clinton's camp got back to us. A spokesman pointed us to a line from Ginsberg's dissent that \"seems to be pretty in line with\" Clinton's comments. \"The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga (Wood Specialties, another plaintiff in the case) would override significant interests of the corporations\u2019 employees and covered dependents.

She left the NRA some room. But the NRA stretches her words to an almost unrecognizable form. Clinton focused her comments on voluntary buyback programs similar to those some U.S. communities have instituted for guns and the federal \"cash-for-clunkers\" program. She was ambiguous about how a U.S. guns buyback program might be structured, saying \"I don\u2019t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work.\" And her campaign since has said she opposes gun confiscation. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e238568-ad07-4375-9b74-3a07ed468f3c", "label": false}, {"id": "7562.json", "claim": "Already, a prototype driverless car has traveled more than 300,000 miles in the crowded maze of California streets without a single accident.", "explain": "During his CPAC speech, Bush talked about technological innovations underway and that will occur over the next 100 years. \"Already, a prototype driverless car has traveled more than 300,000 miles in the crowded maze of California streets without a single accident,\" Bush said.

The state proposal set emissions limits on power plants and included a \"safety valve\" feature which allowed the companies to buy emission offsets from environmental programs rather than make the reductions in their own facilities. \"You could reduce your emissions or pay into some alternative compliance fund,\" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University professor who helped develop the plan. \"He (Romney) was looking for mechanisms that would still serve the goals of the program but would limit the financial exposure of the regulated firms.\" To Pizer, these carbon limits don\u2019t fit the definition of cap and trade. \"Maybe you\u2019d call it the same family, but it\u2019s different because you\u2019re telling each source, \u2018here\u2019s what your limit is, but you can buy reductions from these other programs.\u2019 This idea of trying to limit businesses\u2019 exposure from compliance costs is not a feature of cap and trade.\" We also talked to Fred Bayles, a former reporter for the Associated Press and USA Today who covered Romney\u2019s administration. He now teaches at Boston University. In Bayles\u2019 opinion, the Massachusetts pollution regulations \"fit the broad definition of cap and trade.\" But he added, \"it\u2019s in the eye of the beholder.\" We think the emission limits Romney put in place might still raise the hackles of Santorum and other critics of cap and trade. But his program lacked the feature most commonly associated with cap and trade -- namely, an allowance for companies that come in below their emission caps to sell credits to other polluters. The new information adds some helpful details about Romney's position in the past. It is consistent with what we said in our original story, above, that Romney had expressed some support for cap and trade but backed away from it when he declined to sign on to a regional cap and trade pact.", "label": false}, {"id": "4425.json", "claim": "Since the beginning of the year weve created a net increase of 45,000 jobs.", "explain": "There hasn\u2019t been enough time for them to kick in, they say.

They also cite a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for all its services by the same year. Another respected financial outlook, however, projects a $2 billion operating surplus for California that same year. That estimate paints a very different picture.

It\u2019s not even available to be taught.\" While he appeared to be referencing a recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece, he bungled the details \u2014 and badly. Far from \"not available,\" American history courses are offered at all but one of 33 state universities in California.", "label": false}, {"id": "6699.json", "claim": "Sen. Bob Menendez voted to enact a new tax on the sale of homes of 3.8%.", "explain": "Menendez voted in favor of a bill tied to the health care law that created a tax on investment income for high-income earners. Though that investment income could include profits from real estate transactions, it is not a tax on the sales price of a home and it would not impact the vast majority of Americans. Wealthy individuals who sell their home for a large profit may be subject to the tax, but the blog does not make that clear and suggests the tax applies to the sales price of homes, regardless of an individual\u2019s income.

That's not the case. Actually, Scott is referring only to the state government's specific contribution to overall spending. Scott drums up the state share as an historic investment, and it is in terms of actual dollars. But there are also local and federal dollars that fund Florida schools. When you consider those, Scott's overall recommendation for education spending is still short of what Florida students received before the economic crash. It's about the same as it was under Gov. Jeb Bush when considering inflation.", "label": false}, {"id": "9788.json", "claim": "Ive been here almost every day.", "explain": "When Raddatz said Nixon hadn\u2019t visitedthe scene of Brown\u2019s death for five days, Nixon replied, \"I've been here almost every day.\" Brown was shot Aug. 9 and violence broke out Aug. 10. Nixon first visited a nearby city on Aug. 12, but he didn\u2019t visit Ferguson until Aug. 14. While Nixon was active early \u2014 calling for a federal investigation the morning after a standoff between protesters and police and attending the nearby community meeting \u2014 there is a distinct and noticeable shift in Nixon\u2019s activities starting Aug. 14. Prior to that date, Nixon kept up his schedule and continued to make appearances unrelated to the Ferguson shooting. After that date, he held daily press conferences and meetings near the scene of the crime, visited the location of the shooting, and made no other official public appearances. In all, he was in Ferguson for three days from Aug. 10 through Aug. 16, all toward the end of the week.", "label": false}, {"id": "10710.json", "claim": "In the early 1980s, Sen.

The KGB? That\u2019s a tough one. Owens\u2019 statement rests on a 1983 KGB memo.
